From fairest creatures we desire increase
But as the riper should by time decease
His tender heir might bear his memory
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
Making a famine where abundance lies
Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
And only herald to the gaudy spring
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
Pity the world or else this glutton be
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow
Will be a tattered weed of small worth held
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days
To say within thine own deep sunken eyes
Proving his beauty by succession thine
This were to be new made when thou art old
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Calls back the lovely April of her prime
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
But if thou live remembered not to be
Die single and thine image dies with thee
Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
And being frank she lends to those are free
Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give
Profitless usurer why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums yet canst not live
For having traffic with thy self alone
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone
What acceptable audit canst thou leave
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same
And that unfair which fairly doth excel
To hideous winter and confounds him there
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was
But flowers distilled though they with winter meet
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan
Or ten times happier be it ten for one
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
Leaving thee living in posterity
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head each under eye
Serving with looks his sacred majesty
Resembling strong youth in his middle age
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
Attending on his golden pilgrimage
But when from highmost pitch with weary car
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day
From his low tract and look another way
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son
Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
By unions married do offend thine ear
They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
Mark how one string sweet husband to another
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering
Resembling sire and child and happy mother
Who all in one one pleasing note do sing
Whose speechless song being many seeming one
Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife
The world will be thy widow and still weep
That thou no form of thee hast left behind
When every private widow well may keep
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
And kept unused the user so destroys it
No love toward others in that bosom sits
Who for thy self art so unprovident
Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire
O change thy thought that I may change my mind
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
Be as thy presence is gracious and kind
Make thee another self for love of me
That beauty still may live in thine or thee
In one of thine from that which thou departest
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
Without this folly age and cold decay
If all were minded so the times should cease
And threescore year would make the world away
Let those whom nature hath not made for store
Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence
O that you were your self but love you are
No longer yours than you your self here live
Against this coming end you should prepare
And your sweet semblance to some other give
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination then you were
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
O none but unthrifts dear my love you know
You had a father let your son say so
Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck
And yet methinks I have astronomy
But not to tell of good or evil luck
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell
Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive
And constant stars in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert
Or else of thee this I prognosticate
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment
When I perceive that men as plants increase
Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
And wear their brave state out of memory
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight
Where wasteful time debateth with decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night
And all in war with Time for love of you
As he takes from you I engraft you new
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time
And fortify your self in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme
Now stand you on the top of happy hours
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers
Much liker than your painted counterfeit
So should the lines of life that life repair
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live your self in eyes of men
To give away your self keeps your self still
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts
If I could write the beauty of your eyes
And in fresh numbers number all your graces
The age to come would say this poet lies
Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue
And stretched metre of an antique song
But were some child of yours alive that time
You should live twice in it and in my rhyme
Thou art more lovely and more temperate
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
And often is his gold complexion dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see
So long lives this and this gives life to thee
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood
To the wide world and all her fading sweets
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
Him in thy course untainted do allow
Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong
My love shall in my verse ever live young
Hast thou the master mistress of my passion
An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
A man in hue all hues in his controlling
And for a woman wert thou first created
And by addition me of thee defeated
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing
So is it not with me as with that muse
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse
Who heaven it self for ornament doth use
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
Making a couplement of proud compare
O let me true in love but truly write
And then believe me my love is as fair
Let them say more that like of hearsay well
I will not praise that purpose not to sell
My glass shall not persuade me I am old
So long as youth and thou are of one date
Then look I death my days should expiate
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart
Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
How can I then be elder than thou art
O therefore love be of thyself so wary
As I not for my self but for thee will
Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
As an unperfect actor on the stage
Who with his fear is put beside his part
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
So I for fear of trust forget to say
O let my looks be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast
Who plead for love and look for recompense
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed
O learn to read what silent love hath writ
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
They draw but what they see know not the heart
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast
Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most
And in themselves their pride lies buried
For at a frown they in their glory die
The painful warrior famoused for fight
After a thousand victories once foiled
Is from the book of honour razed quite
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled
Then happy I that love and am beloved
Where I may not remove nor be removed
Lord of my love to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
To thee I send this written embassage
To witness duty not to show my wit
Duty so great which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare in wanting words to show it
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspect
And puts apparel on my tattered loving
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee
Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me
Weary with toil I haste me to my bed
The dear respose for limbs with travel tired
But then begins a journey in my head
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide
Looking on darkness which the blind do see
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new
Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
For thee and for my self no quiet find
How can I then return in happy plight
That am debarred the benefit of rest
But day by night and night by day oppressed
Do in consent shake hands to torture me
The one by toil the other to complain
How far I toil still farther off from thee
I tell the day to please him thou art bright
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
I all alone beweep my outcast state
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
And look upon my self and curse my fate
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope
Featured like him like him with friends possessed
With what I most enjoy contented least
Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising
Haply I think on thee and then my state
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
That then I scorn to change my state with kings
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone
Which I new pay as if not paid before
All losses are restored and sorrows end
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
Which I by lacking have supposed dead
And all those friends which I thought buried
How many a holy and obsequious tear
As interest of the dead which now appear
But things removed that hidden in thee lie
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
Who all their parts of me to thee did give
That due of many now is thine alone
Their images I loved I view in thee
When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
And though they be outstripped by every pen
Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
Exceeded by the height of happier men
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
A dearer birth than this his love had brought
To march in ranks of better equipage
But since he died and poets better prove
Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
Kissing with golden face the meadows green
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
With ugly rack on his celestial face
And from the forlorn world his visage hide
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
Even so my sun one early morn did shine
With all triumphant splendour on my brow
But out alack he was but one hour mine
The region cloud hath masked him from me now
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
And make me travel forth without my cloak
For no man well of such a salve can speak
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
Though thou repent yet I have still the loss
Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done
Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
All men make faults and even I in this
Authorizing thy trespass with compare
My self corrupting salving thy amiss
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense
Thy adverse party is thy advocate
Such civil war is in my love and hate
That I an accessary needs must be
To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me
Let me confess that we two must be twain
Although our undivided loves are one
So shall those blots that do with me remain
Without thy help by me be borne alone
In our two loves there is but one respect
Though in our lives a separable spite
I may not evermore acknowledge thee
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
Nor thou with public kindness honour me
Unless thou take that honour from thy name
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
As a decrepit father takes delight
To see his active child do deeds of youth
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
Or any of these all or all or more
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
I make my love engrafted to this store
So then I am not lame poor nor despised
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
That I in thy abundance am sufficed
And by a part of all thy glory live
Look what is best that best I wish in thee
This wish I have then ten times happy me
How can my muse want subject to invent
Thine own sweet argument too excellent
For every vulgar paper to rehearse
O give thy self the thanks if aught in me
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight
When thou thy self dost give invention light
Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate
And he that calls on thee let him bring forth
Eternal numbers to outlive long date
If my slight muse do please these curious days
The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise
O how thy worth with manners may I sing
When thou art all the better part of me
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring
Even for this let us divided live
And our dear love lose name of single one
That by this separation I may give
O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
To entertain the time with thoughts of love
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
And that thou teachest how to make one twain
By praising him here who doth hence remain
Take all my loves my love yea take them all
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before
No love my love that thou mayst true love call
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more
Then if for my love thou my love receivest
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest
By wilful taste of what thy self refusest
I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
Although thou steal thee all my poverty
And yet love knows it is a greater grief
Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes
Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits
When I am sometime absent from thy heart
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits
For still temptation follows where thou art
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won
Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed
Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear
And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth
Who lead thee in their riot even there
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
Thine by thy beauty being false to me
That thou hast her it is not all my grief
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly
That she hath thee is of my wailing chief
A loss in love that touches me more nearly
Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me
And losing her my friend hath found that loss
Both find each other and I lose both twain
And both for my sake lay on me this cross
Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone
When most I wink then do mine eyes best see
For all the day they view things unrespected
But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed
Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
To the clear day with thy much clearer light
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
By looking on thee in the living day
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
All days are nights to see till I see thee
And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought
Injurious distance should not stop my way
For then despite of space I would be brought
From limits far remote where thou dost stay
No matter then although my foot did stand
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
As soon as think the place where he would be
But ah thought kills me that I am not thought
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
But that so much of earth and water wrought
Receiving nought by elements so slow
The other two slight air and purging fire
Are both with thee wherever I abide
The first my thought the other my desire
For when these quicker elements are gone
In tender embassy of love to thee
My life being made of four with two alone
Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy
By those swift messengers returned from thee
Who even but now come back again assured
Of thy fair health recounting it to me
This told I joy but then no longer glad
I send them back again and straight grow sad
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
How to divide the conquest of thy sight
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
But the defendant doth that plea deny
And says in him thy fair appearance lies
To side this title is impanelled
A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
And by their verdict is determined
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
And each doth good turns now unto the other
When that mine eye is famished for a look
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
And to the painted banquet bids my heart
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part
So either by thy picture or my love
Thy self away art present still with me
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
And I am still with them and they with thee
Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
How careful was I when I took my way
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust
That to my use it might unused stay
From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
But thou to whom my jewels trifles are
Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief
Thou best of dearest and mine only care
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief
Thee have I not locked up in any chest
Save where thou art not though I feel thou art
Within the gentle closure of my breast
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear
When I shall see thee frown on my defects
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
Called to that audit by advised respects
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
When love converted from the thing it was
Shall reasons find of settled gravity
Against that time do I ensconce me here
Within the knowledge of mine own desert
And this my hand against my self uprear
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part
To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
Since why to love I can allege no cause
How heavy do I journey on the way
Doth teach that case and that repose to say
The beast that bears me tired with my woe
Plods dully on to bear that weight in me
As if by some instinct the wretch did know
His rider loved not speed being made from thee
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
Which heavily he answers with a groan
More sharp to me than spurring to his side
For that same groan doth put this in my mind
My grief lies onward and my joy behind
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed
From where thou art why should I haste me thence
Till I return of posting is no need
O what excuse will my poor beast then find
When swift extremity can seem but slow
Then should I spur though mounted on the wind
In winged speed no motion shall I know
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace
But love for love thus shall excuse my jade
So am I as the rich whose blessed key
The which he will not every hour survey
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
Since seldom coming in that long year set
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are
Or captain jewels in the carcanet
So is the time that keeps you as my chest
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
By new unfolding his imprisoned pride
Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
Being had to triumph being lacked to hope
What is your substance whereof are you made
That millions of strange shadows on you tend
Since every one hath every one one shade
And you but one can every shadow lend
Describe Adonis and the counterfeit
Is poorly imitated after you
And you in Grecian tires are painted new
Speak of the spring and foison of the year
The one doth shadow of your beauty show
The other as your bounty doth appear
And you in every blessed shape we know
In all external grace you have some part
But you like none none you for constant heart
O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give
The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
For that sweet odour which doth in it live
The canker blooms have full as deep a dye
As the perfumed tincture of the roses
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
But for their virtue only is their show
They live unwooed and unrespected fade
Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
And so of you beauteous and lovely youth
When that shall vade by verse distills your truth
Not marble nor the gilded monuments
Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
But you shall shine more bright in these contents
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time
When wasteful war shall statues overturn
And broils root out the work of masonry
The living record of your memory
Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
Even in the eyes of all posterity
That wear this world out to the ending doom
So till the judgment that your self arise
Sweet love renew thy force be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness
The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks that when they see
Return of love more blest may be the view
Or call it winter which being full of care
Being your slave what should I do but tend
Upon the hours and times of your desire
I have no precious time at all to spend
Nor services to do till you require
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
When you have bid your servant once adieu
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
Where you may be or your affairs suppose
But like a sad slave stay and think of nought
Save where you are how happy you make those
So true a fool is love that in your will
That god forbid that made me first your slave
I should in thought control your times of pleasure
Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
And patience tame to sufferance bide each check
Without accusing you of injury
Be where you list your charter is so strong
That you your self may privilage your time
To what you will to you it doth belong
I am to wait though waiting so be hell
Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well
If there be nothing new but that which is
Hath been before how are our brains beguiled
Which labouring for invention bear amis
The second burthen of a former child
O that record could with a backward look
Even of five hundred courses of the sun
Show me your image in some antique book
Since mind at first in character was done
That I might see what the old world could say
To this composed wonder of your frame
Whether we are mended or whether better they
Or whether revolution be the same
O sure I am the wits of former days
To subjects worse have given admiring praise
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
So do our minutes hasten to their end
Each changing place with that which goes before
In sequent toil all forwards do contend
Nativity once in the main of light
Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand
Is it thy will thy image should keep open
My heavy eyelids to the weary night
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight
So far from home into my deeds to pry
To find out shames and idle hours in me
The scope and tenure of thy jealousy
O no thy love though much is not so great
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
To play the watchman ever for thy sake
For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
From me far off with others all too near
And all my soul and all my every part
And for this sin there is no remedy
It is so grounded inward in my heart
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine
No shape so true no truth of such account
And for my self mine own worth do define
As I all other in all worths surmount
But when my glass shows me my self indeed
beated and chopt with tanned antiquity
Painting my age with beauty of thy days
Against my love shall be as I am now
When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
Are vanishing or vanished out of sight
Stealing away the treasure of his spring
For such a time do I now fortify
That he shall never cut from memory
His beauty shall in these black lines be seen
And they shall live and he in them still green
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the firm soil win of the watery main
Increasing store with loss and loss with store
When I have seen such interchange of State
Or state it self confounded to decay
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
That Time will come and take my love away
This thought is as a death which cannot choose
But weep to have that which it fears to lose
Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
Whose action is no stronger than a flower
When rocks impregnable are not so stout
Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
O fearful meditation where alack
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
O none unless this miracle have might
That in black ink my love may still shine bright
Tired with all these for restful death I cry
As to behold desert a beggar born
And needy nothing trimmed in jollity
And purest faith unhappily forsworn
And gilded honour shamefully misplaced
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced
And strength by limping sway disabled
And simple truth miscalled simplicity
And captive good attending captain ill
Tired with all these from these would I be gone
Save that to die I leave my love alone
Ah wherefore with infection should he live
And with his presence grace impiety
That sin by him advantage should achieve
And lace it self with his society
Why should false painting imitate his cheek
And steal dead seeming of his living hue
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
Roses of shadow since his rose is true
Why should he live now nature bankrupt is
Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins
For she hath no exchequer now but his
And proud of many lives upon his gains
O him she stores to show what wealth she had
In days long since before these last so bad
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now
Before these bastard signs of fair were born
Or durst inhabit on a living brow
Before the golden tresses of the dead
The right of sepulchres were shorn away
To live a second life on second head
In him those holy antique hours are seen
Without all ornament it self and true
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new
And him as for a map doth Nature store
To show false Art what beauty was of yore
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
In other accents do this praise confound
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown
They look into the beauty of thy mind
And that in guess they measure by thy deeds
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
But why thy odour matcheth not thy show
The soil is this that thou dost common grow
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
The ornament of beauty is suspect
So thou be good slander doth but approve
Thy worth the greater being wooed of time
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days
Either not assailed or victor being charged
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
To tie up envy evermore enlarged
If some suspect of ill masked not thy show
Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe
No longer mourn for me when I am dead
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell
Give warning to the world that I am fled
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
Nay if you read this line remember not
The hand that writ it for I love you so
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
If thinking on me then should make you woe
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse
But let your love even with my life decay
Lest the wise world should look into your moan
And mock you with me after I am gone
O lest the world should task you to recite
What merit lived in me that you should love
For you in me can nothing worthy prove
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie
To do more for me than mine own desert
And hang more praise upon deceased I
Than niggard truth would willingly impart
O lest your true love may seem false in this
That you for love speak well of me untrue
My name be buried where my body is
And live no more to shame nor me nor you
For I am shamed by that which I bring forth
And so should you to love things nothing worth
That time of year thou mayst in me behold
When yellow leaves or none or few do hang
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold
Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang
In me thou seest the twilight of such day
As after sunset fadeth in the west
Which by and by black night doth take away
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie
Consumed with that which it was nourished by
To love that well which thou must leave ere long
But be contented when that fell arrest
Without all bail shall carry me away
My life hath in this line some interest
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay
When thou reviewest this thou dost review
The very part was consecrate to thee
The earth can have but earth which is his due
My spirit is thine the better part of me
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
The prey of worms my body being dead
Too base of thee to be remembered
The worth of that is that which it contains
And that is this and this with thee remains
So are you to my thoughts as food to life
And for the peace of you I hold such strife
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
Now counting best to be with you alone
Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
And by and by clean starved for a look
Possessing or pursuing no delight
Save what is had or must from you be took
Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day
Or gluttoning on all or all away
Why is my verse so barren of new pride
So far from variation or quick change
Why with the time do I not glance aside
Why write I still all one ever the same
And keep invention in a noted weed
That every word doth almost tell my name
Showing their birth and where they did proceed
O know sweet love I always write of you
And you and love are still my argument
So all my best is dressing old words new
Spending again what is already spent
For as the sun is daily new and old
So is my love still telling what is told
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory
Look what thy memory cannot contain
Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
Those children nursed delivered from thy brain
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind
These offices so oft as thou wilt look
Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book
So oft have I invoked thee for my muse
And found such fair assistance in my verse
As every alien pen hath got my use
And under thee their poesy disperse
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
And given grace a double majesty
Yet be most proud of that which I compile
Whose influence is thine and born of thee
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be
But thou art all my art and dost advance
As high as learning my rude ignorance
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace
But now my gracious numbers are decayed
And my sick muse doth give an other place
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
He robs thee of and pays it thee again
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
From thy behaviour beauty doth he give
And found it in thy cheek he can afford
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live
Then thank him not for that which he doth say
Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay
O how I faint when I of you do write
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name
And in the praise thereof spends all his might
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear
On your broad main doth wilfully appear
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
He of tall building and of goodly pride
Then if he thrive and I be cast away
The worst was this my love was my decay
Or I shall live your epitaph to make
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten
From hence your memory death cannot take
Although in me each part will be forgotten
Your name from hence immortal life shall have
The earth can yield me but a common grave
Your monument shall be my gentle verse
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
When all the breathers of this world are dead
Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men
I grant thou wert not married to my muse
The dedicated words which writers use
Of their fair subject blessing every book
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise
And therefore art enforced to seek anew
And do so love yet when they have devised
What strained touches rhetoric can lend
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
And their gross painting might be better used
Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused
I never saw that you did painting need
And therefore to your fair no painting set
And therefore have I slept in your report
That you your self being extant well might show
How far a modern quill doth come too short
Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
This silence for my sin you did impute
Which shall be most my glory being dumb
For I impair not beauty being mute
When others would give life and bring a tomb
There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
Than both your poets can in praise devise
Who is it that says most which can say more
Than this rich praise that you alone are you
In whose confine immured is the store
Which should example where your equal grew
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
That to his subject lends not some small glory
But he that writes of you if he can tell
That you are you so dignifies his story
Let him but copy what in you is writ
Not making worse what nature made so clear
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit
Making his style admired every where
You to your beauteous blessings add a curse
Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse
While comments of your praise richly compiled
Reserve their character with golden quill
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words
And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen
To every hymn that able spirit affords
In polished form of well refined pen
And to the most of praise add something more
But that is in my thought whose love to you
Then others for the breath of words respect
Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
No neither he nor his compeers by night
Giving him aid my verse astonished
He nor that affable familiar ghost
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
As victors of my silence cannot boast
I was not sick of any fear from thence
But when your countenance filled up his line
Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine
Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
My bonds in thee are all determinate
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting
And for that riches where is my deserving
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
And so my patent back again is swerving
So thy great gift upon misprision growing
Comes home again on better judgement making
Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter
In sleep a king but waking no such matter
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light
And place my merit in the eye of scorn
And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
With mine own weakness being best acquainted
Upon thy part I can set down a story
Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory
And I by this will be a gainer too
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee
The injuries that to my self I do
Such is my love to thee I so belong
That for thy right my self will bear all wrong
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
And I will comment upon that offence
Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt
Against thy reasons making no defence
To set a form upon desired change
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange
Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
And haply of our old acquaintance tell
Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
Come in the rearward of a conquered woe
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow
To linger out a purposed overthrow
If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
When other petty griefs have done their spite
But in the onset come so shall I taste
And other strains of woe which now seem woe
Compared with loss of thee will not seem so
Some glory in their birth some in their skill
Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest
But these particulars are not my measure
All these I better in one general best
Thy love is better than high birth to me
Of more delight than hawks and horses be
Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
All this away and me most wretchcd make
But do thy worst to steal thy self away
For term of life thou art assured mine
And life no longer than thy love will stay
For it depends upon that love of thine
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs
When in the least of them my life hath end
I see a better state to me belongs
Than that which on thy humour doth depend
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
O what a happy title do I find
Happy to have thy love happy to die
Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not
So shall I live supposing thou art true
May still seem love to me though altered new
Thy looks with me thy heart in other place
For there can live no hatred in thine eye
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
But heaven in thy creation did decree
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show
They that have power to hurt and will do none
That do not do the thing they most do show
Who moving others are themselves as stone
Unmoved cold and to temptation slow
Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces
Others but stewards of their excellence
Though to it self it only live and die
But if that flower with base infection meet
The basest weed outbraves his dignity
For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
Which like a canker in the fragrant rose
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
That tongue that tells the story of thy days
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
Naming thy name blesses an ill report
O what a mansion have those vices got
Which for their habitation chose out thee
And all things turns to fair that eyes can see
Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less
As on the finger of a throned queen
The basest jewel will be well esteemed
So are those errors that in thee are seen
To truths translated and for true things deemed
How many lambs might the stern wolf betray
If like a lamb he could his looks translate
How many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
But do not so I love thee in such sort
As thou being mine mine is thy good report
How like a winter hath my absence been
From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
What freezings have I felt what dark days seen
The teeming autumn big with rich increase
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime
Yet this abundant issue seemed to me
But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee
And thou away the very birds are mute
From you have I been absent in the spring
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
They were but sweet but figures of delight
Drawn after you you pattern of all those
Yet seemed it winter still and you away
As with your shadow I with these did play
The forward violet thus did I chide
Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells
The lily I condemned for thy hand
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand
One blushing shame another white despair
And to his robbery had annexed thy breath
But for his theft in pride of all his growth
A vengeful canker eat him up to death
More flowers I noted yet I none could see
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem
In gentle numbers time so idly spent
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
And gives thy pen both skill and argument
If time have any wrinkle graven there
If any be a satire to decay
Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life
O truant Muse what shall be thy amends
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
Both truth and beauty on my love depends
So dost thou too and therein dignified
Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say
Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb
And to be praised of ages yet to be
Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how
To make him seem long hence as he shows now
My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming
I love not less though less the show appear
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
Our love was new and then but in the spring
When I was wont to greet it with my lays
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days
Not that the summer is less pleasant now
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
But that wild music burthens every bough
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight
Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue
Because I would not dull you with my song
Alack what poverty my muse brings forth
That having such a scope to show her pride
The argument all bare is of more worth
Than when it hath my added praise beside
O blame me not if I no more can write
Look in your glass and there appears a face
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
Were it not sinful then striving to mend
To mar the subject that before was well
For to no other pass my verses tend
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell
And more much more than in my verse can sit
Your own glass shows you when you look in it
To me fair friend you never can be old
For as you were when first your eye I eyed
Such seems your beauty still three winters cold
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned
In process of the seasons have I seen
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned
Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green
Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived
So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
For fear of which hear this thou age unbred
Let not my love be called idolatry
Nor my beloved as an idol show
Since all alike my songs and praises be
To one of one still such and ever so
Still constant in a wondrous excellence
Therefore my verse to constancy confined
One thing expressing leaves out difference
Fair kind and true is all my argument
Fair kind and true varying to other words
And in this change is my invention spent
Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
Fair kind and true have often lived alone
Which three till now never kept seat in one
When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
I see their antique pen would have expressed
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time all you prefiguring
And for they looked but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing
For we which now behold these present days
Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise
Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come
Can yet the lease of my true love control
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
And the sad augurs mock their own presage
Incertainties now crown themselves assured
And peace proclaims olives of endless age
Now with the drops of this most balmy time
My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
And thou in this shalt find thy monument
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
That may express my love or thy dear merit
Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine
Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name
Weighs not the dust and injury of age
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
But makes antiquity for aye his page
Finding the first conceit of love there bred
Where time and outward form would show it dead
O never say that I was false of heart
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify
As easy might I from my self depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
That is my home of love if I have ranged
Like him that travels I return again
Just to the time not with the time exchanged
So that my self bring water for my stain
Never believe though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
That it could so preposterously be stained
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good
For nothing this wide universe I call
Save thou my rose in it thou art my all
And made my self a motley to the view
Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
Made old offences of affections new
Most true it is that I have looked on truth
Askance and strangely but by all above
These blenches gave my heart another youth
And worse essays proved thee my best of love
Now all is done have what shall have no end
Mine appetite I never more will grind
On newer proof to try an older friend
A god in love to whom I am confined
Then give me welcome next my heaven the best
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast
O for my sake do you with Fortune chide
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
That did not better for my life provide
Than public means which public manners breeds
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand
And almost thence my nature is subdued
Pity me then and wish I were renewed
Whilst like a willing patient I will drink
No bitterness that I will bitter think
Nor double penance to correct correction
Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye
Even that your pity is enough to cure me
Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow
For what care I who calls me well or ill
You are my all the world and I must strive
To know my shames and praises from your tongue
None else to me nor I to none alive
That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong
In so profound abysm I throw all care
To critic and to flatterer stopped are
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense
You are so strongly in my purpose bred
That all the world besides methinks are dead
Since I left you mine eye is in my mind
And that which governs me to go about
Doth part his function and is partly blind
Seems seeing but effectually is out
For it no form delivers to the heart
Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
The mountain or the sea the day or night
The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
Incapable of more replete with you
My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue
Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you
Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true
And that your love taught it this alchemy
To make of monsters and things indigest
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
Creating every bad a perfect best
As fast as objects to his beams assemble
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up
And to his palate doth prepare the cup
That mine eye loves it and doth first begin
Those lines that I before have writ do lie
Even those that said I could not love you dearer
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
But reckoning time whose millioned accidents
Crowning the present doubting of the rest
Love is a babe then might I not say so
To give full growth to that which still doth grow
Let me not to the marriage of true minds
Admit impediments love is not love
Which alters when it alteration finds
Or bends with the remover to remove
That looks on tempests and is never shaken
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
But bears it out even to the edge of doom
If this be error and upon me proved
I never writ nor no man ever loved
Accuse me thus that I have scanted all
Wherein I should your great deserts repay
Forgot upon your dearest love to call
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
That I have frequent been with unknown minds
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
Which should transport me farthest from your sight
Book both my wilfulness and errors down
And on just proof surmise accumulate
Bring me within the level of your frown
But shoot not at me in your wakened hate
Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
The constancy and virtue of your love
Like as to make our appetite more keen
With eager compounds we our palate urge
As to prevent our maladies unseen
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
To be diseased ere that there was true needing
The ills that were not grew to faults assured
And brought to medicine a healthful state
Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
But thence I learn and find the lesson true
Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears
Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
Still losing when I saw my self to win
What wretched errors hath my heart committed
Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
In the distraction of this madding fever
O benefit of ill now I find true
That better is by evil still made better
And ruined love when it is built anew
Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
So I return rebuked to my content
And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent
That you were once unkind befriends me now
And for that sorrow which I then did feel
Needs must I under my transgression bow
Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel
For if you were by my unkindness shaken
And I a tyrant have no leisure taken
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime
O that our night of woe might have remembered
My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
And soon to you as you to me then tendered
The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits
But that your trespass now becomes a fee
Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me
When not to be receives reproach of being
And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed
Give salutation to my sportive blood
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies
Which in their wills count bad what I think good
No I am that I am and they that level
At my abuses reckon up their own
I may be straight though they themselves be bevel
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
Unless this general evil they maintain
All men are bad and in their badness reign
Thy gift thy tables are within my brain
Full charactered with lasting memory
Which shall above that idle rank remain
Beyond all date even to eternity
Or at the least so long as brain and heart
Have faculty by nature to subsist
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
Of thee thy record never can be missed
That poor retention could not so much hold
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score
Therefore to give them from me was I bold
To trust those tables that receive thee more
To keep an adjunct to remember thee
Were to import forgetfulness in me
No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change
Thy pyramids built up with newer might
To me are nothing novel nothing strange
They are but dressings Of a former sight
Our dates are brief and therefore we admire
What thou dost foist upon us that is old
And rather make them born to our desire
Than think that we before have heard them told
Thy registers and thee I both defy
For thy records and what we see doth lie
Made more or less by thy continual haste
This I do vow and this shall ever be
I will be true despite thy scythe and thee
If my dear love were but the child of state
Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered
No it was builded far from accident
It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
Under the blow of thralled discontent
It fears not policy that heretic
But all alone stands hugely politic
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
To this I witness call the fools of time
Which die for goodness who have lived for crime
With my extern the outward honouring
Or laid great bases for eternity
Which proves more short than waste or ruining
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
Lose all and more by paying too much rent
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour
Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
No let me be obsequious in thy heart
And take thou my oblation poor but free
Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art
But mutual render only me for thee
Hence thou suborned informer a true soul
When most impeached stands least in thy control
O thou my lovely boy who in thy power
As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure
She may detain but not still keep her treasure
And her quietus is to render thee
In the old age black was not counted fair
And beauty slandered with a bastard shame
Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
But is profaned if not lives in disgrace
Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
At such who not born fair no beauty lack
Slandering creation with a false esteem
Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
That every tongue says beauty should look so
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand
Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
To be so tickled they would change their state
And situation with those dancing chips
Making dead wood more blest than living lips
Since saucy jacks so happy are in this
Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss
Is lust in action and till action lust
Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight
Past reason hunted and no sooner had
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait
On purpose laid to make the taker mad
Mad in pursuit and in possession so
Had having and in quest to have extreme
A bliss in proof and proved a very woe
Before a joy proposed behind a dream
All this the world well knows yet none knows well
To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell
Coral is far more red than her lips red
If snow be white why then her breasts are dun
If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
I have seen roses damasked red and white
But no such roses see I in her cheeks
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
I love to hear her speak yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound
I grant I never saw a goddess go
My mistress when she walks treads on the ground
And yet by heaven I think my love as rare
As any she belied with false compare
Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
Yet in good faith some say that thee behold
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan
To say they err I dare not be so bold
Although I swear it to my self alone
And to be sure that is not false I swear
A thousand groans but thinking on thy face
In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
And thence this slander as I think proceeds
Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me
Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain
Have put on black and loving mourners be
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
And truly not the morning sun of heaven
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
Nor that full star that ushers in the even
Doth half that glory to the sober west
As those two mourning eyes become thy face
O let it then as well beseem thy heart
To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
And suit thy pity like in every part
Then will I swear beauty herself is black
And all they foul that thy complexion lack
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me
Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed
Of him my self and thee I am forsaken
Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol
And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee
Perforce am thine and all that is in me
So now I have confessed that he is thine
And I my self am mortgaged to thy will
Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
But thou wilt not nor he will not be free
For thou art covetous and he is kind
Under that bond that him as fist doth bind
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake
So him I lose through my unkind abuse
Him have I lost thou hast both him and me
He pays the whole and yet am I not free
Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
More than enough am I that vex thee still
To thy sweet will making addition thus
Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
Shall will in others seem right gracious
And in my will no fair acceptance shine
The sea all water yet receives rain still
And in abundance addeth to his store
So thou being rich in will add to thy will
One will of mine to make thy large will more
Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
If thy soul check thee that I come so near
And will thy soul knows is admitted there
Ay fill it full with wills and my will one
In things of great receipt with case we prove
Among a number one is reckoned none
Then in the number let me pass untold
For nothing hold me so it please thee hold
That nothing me a something sweet to thee
Make but my name thy love and love that still
Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes
That they behold and see not what they see
They know what beauty is see where it lies
Yet what the best is take the worst to be
Be anchored in the bay where all men ride
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
Why should my heart think that a several plot
Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
To put fair truth upon so foul a face
In things right true my heart and eyes have erred
And to this false plague are they now transferred
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutored youth
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed
But wherefore says she not she is unjust
And wherefore say not I that I am old
And age in love loves not to have years told
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flattered be
O call not me to justify the wrong
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
Use power with power and slay me not by art
Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies
And therefore from my face she turns my foes
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries
Yet do not so but since I am near slain
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain
Be wise as thou art cruel do not press
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
If I might teach thee wit better it were
Though not to love yet love to tell me so
As testy sick men when their deaths be near
No news but health from their physicians know
For if I should despair I should grow mad
And in my madness might speak ill of thee
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
That I may not be so nor thou belied
Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide
In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes
For they in thee a thousand errors note
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote
Nor tender feeling to base touches prone
Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
To any sensual feast with thee alone
But my five wits nor my five senses can
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man
Only my plague thus far I count my gain
That she that makes me sin awards me pain
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
O but with mine compare thou thine own state
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving
Or if it do not from those lips of thine
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
Root pity in thy heart that when it grows
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be
If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch
One of her feathered creatures broke away
Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
To follow that which flies before her face
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will
If thou turn back and my loud crying still
Two loves I have of comfort and despair
Which like two spirits do suggest me still
The better angel is a man right fair
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill
To win me soon to hell my female evil
Tempteth my better angel from my side
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil
Wooing his purity with her foul pride
And whether that my angel be turned fiend
Suspect I may yet not directly tell
But being both from me both to each friend
Till my bad angel fire my good one out
To me that languished for her sake
But when she saw my woeful state
Straight in her heart did mercy come
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
Was used in giving gentle doom
And taught it thus anew to greet
That followed it as gentle day
Doth follow night who like a fiend
From heaven to hell is flown away
Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
My sinful earth these rebel powers array
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay
Why so large cost having so short a lease
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
Shall worms inheritors of this excess
And let that pine to aggravate thy store
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
Within be fed without be rich no more
So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men
My love is as a fever longing still
For that which longer nurseth the disease
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
My reason the physician to my love
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept
Hath left me and I desperate now approve
Desire is death which physic did except
Past cure I am now reason is past care
At random from the truth vainly expressed
For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
Who art as black as hell as dark as night
O me what eyes hath love put in my head
Which have no correspondence with true sight
Or if they have where is my judgment fled
That censures falsely what they see aright
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
What means the world to say it is not so
If it be not then love doth well denote
That is so vexed with watching and with tears
No marvel then though I mistake my view
The sun it self sees not till heaven clears
Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not
When I against my self with thee partake
Do I not think on thee when I forgot
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend
Revenge upon my self with present moan
What merit do I in my self respect
That is so proud thy service to despise
When all my best doth worship thy defect
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes
But love hate on for now I know thy mind
O from what power hast thou this powerful might
With insufficiency my heart to sway
To make me give the lie to my true sight
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
That in the very refuse of thy deeds
There is such strength and warrantise of skill
That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
The more I hear and see just cause of hate
O though I love what others do abhor
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state
If thy unworthiness raised love in me
More worthy I to be beloved of thee
Love is too young to know what conscience is
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love
Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
For thou betraying me I do betray
My soul doth tell my body that he may
Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason
But rising at thy name doth point out thee
As his triumphant prize proud of this pride
He is contented thy poor drudge to be
To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
No want of conscience hold it that I call
Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall
But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
In vowing new hate after new love bearing
When I break twenty I am perjured most
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
And all my honest faith in thee is lost
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
Or made them swear against the thing they see
For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I
To swear against the truth so foul a be
Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love
A dateless lively heat still to endure
And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast
I sick withal the help of bath desired
And thither hied a sad distempered guest
But found no cure the bath for my help lies
Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep
Came tripping by but in her maiden hand
The fairest votary took up that fire
Which many legions of true hearts had warmed
And so the general of hot desire
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed
This brand she quenched in a cool well by
Growing a bath and healthful remedy
Came there for cure and this by that I prove

SCENE
Rousillon Paris Florence Marseilles
ACT I SCENE 1
Enter BERTRAM the COUNTESS OF ROUSILLON HELENA and LAFEU all in black
COUNTESS In delivering my son from me I bury a second husband
ward evermore in subjection
LAFEU You shall find of the King a husband madam you sir a
father He that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it
up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such
abundance
practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other
advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time
immortal and death should have play for lack of work Would for
COUNTESS He was famous sir in his profession and it was his
LAFEU He was excellent indeed madam the King very lately spoke
of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have
BERTRAM What is it my good lord the King languishes of
LAFEU A fistula my lord
BERTRAM I heard not of it before
LAFEU I would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman the
daughter of Gerard de Narbon
COUNTESS His sole child my lord and bequeathed to my
overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education
promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts
fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities
too In her they are the better for their simpleness she derives
her honesty and achieves her goodness
LAFEU Your commendations madam get from her tears
The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the
tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek No
more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought
HELENA I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too
LAFEU Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive
grief the enemy to the living
COUNTESS If the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it
soon mortal
BERTRAM Madam I desire your holy wishes
LAFEU How understand we that
COUNTESS Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father
In manners as in shape Thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few
Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use and keep thy friend
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down
Fall on thy head Farewell My lord
Advise him
LAFEU He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love
COUNTESS Heaven bless him Farewell Bertram            Exit
mistress and make much of her
LAFEU Farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your
father                             Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU
HELENA O were that all I think not on my father
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him What was he like
I have forgot him my imagination
I am undone there is no living none
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it he is so above me
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted not in his sphere
The hind that would be mated by the lion
To see him every hour to sit and draw
His arched brows his hawking eye his curls
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour
Must sanctify his relics Who comes here
Enter PAROLLES
And yet I know him a notorious liar
Think him a great way fool solely a coward
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
PAROLLES Save you fair queen
HELENA And you monarch
PAROLLES No
HELENA And no
PAROLLES Are you meditating on virginity
HELENA Ay You have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a
question Man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it
against him
PAROLLES Keep him out
HELENA But he assails and our virginity though valiant in the
defence yet is weak Unfold to us some warlike resistance
PAROLLES There is none Man setting down before you will
undermine you and blow you up
Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
PAROLLES Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown
up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves
made you lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth
of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first
lost That you were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity
by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it
virgin
of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your
mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs
himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be
buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate
offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a
cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with
feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud
Within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly
increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away
HELENA How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of
fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and
the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your
pie and your porridge than in your cheek And your virginity
anything with it
HELENA Not my virginity yet
There shall your master have a thousand loves
A mother and a mistress and a friend
A phoenix captain and an enemy
A guide a goddess and a sovereign
A counsellor a traitress and a dear
His humble ambition proud humility
His jarring concord and his discord dulcet
His faith his sweet disaster with a world
Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms
I know not what he shall God send him well
Which might be felt that we the poorer born
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes
Might with effects of them follow our friends
And show what we alone must think which never
Returns us thanks
Enter PAGE
PAGE Monsieur Parolles my lord calls for you      Exit PAGE
PAROLLES Little Helen farewell if I can remember thee I will
think of thee at court
HELENA Monsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable star
PAROLLES Under Mars I
HELENA I especially think under Mars
PAROLLES Why under Man
HELENA The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born
under Mars
PAROLLES When he was predominant
HELENA When he was retrograde I think rather
PAROLLES Why think you so
HELENA You go so much backward when you fight
HELENA So is running away when fear proposes the safety but the
composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of
a good wing and I like the wear well
PAROLLES I am so full of business I cannot answer thee acutely I
will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else
thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes
thee away Farewell When thou hast leisure say thy prayers
when thou hast none remember thy friends Get thee a good
husband and use him as he uses thee So farewell
Exit
HELENA Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie
Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky
Gives us free scope only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
What power is it which mounts my love so high
That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be Who ever strove
To show her merit that did miss her love
ACT I SCENE 2
Flourish of cornets Enter the KING OF FRANCE with letters
and divers ATTENDANTS
Have fought with equal fortune and continue
A braving war
With caution that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial
FIRST LORD His love and wisdom
For amplest credence
And Florence is denied before he comes
Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service freely have they leave
To stand on either part
SECOND LORD It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry who are sick
For breathing and exploit
Enter BERTRAM LAFEU and PAROLLES
FIRST LORD It is the Count Rousillon my good lord
Young Bertram
Frank nature rather curious than in haste
Mayst thou inherit too Welcome to Paris
KING I would I had that corporal soundness now
As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest He lasted long
But on us both did haggish age steal on
And wore us out of act It much repairs me
To talk of your good father In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour
So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness if they were
Clock to itself knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak and at this time
Making them proud of his humility
In their poor praise he humbled Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times
Which followed well would demonstrate them now
But goers backward
BERTRAM His good remembrance sir
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech
Methinks I hear him now his plausive words
This his good melancholy oft began
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime
Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies
I after him do after him wish too
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home
I quickly were dissolved from my hive
To give some labourers room
They that least lend it you shall lack you first
BERTRAM Some six months since my lord
With several applications Nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure Welcome Count
ACT I SCENE 3
Enter COUNTESS STEWARD and CLOWN
COUNTESS I will now hear what say you of this gentlewoman
STEWARD Madam the care I have had to even your content I wish
might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours for then we
wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings
when of ourselves we publish them
COUNTESS What does this knave here Get you gone sirrah The
slowness that I do not for I know you lack not folly to commit
them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours
COUNTESS Well sir
to go to the world Isbel the woman and I will do as we may
COUNTESS Wilt thou needs be a beggar
CLOWN I do beg your good will in this case
COUNTESS In what case
my body for they say bames are blessings
COUNTESS Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry
CLOWN My poor body madam requires it I am driven on by the
flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives
CLOWN Faith madam I have other holy reasons such as they are
COUNTESS May the world know them
CLOWN I have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh
and blood are and indeed I do marry that I may repent
COUNTESS Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness
COUNTESS Such friends are thine enemies knave
to do that for me which I am aweary of He that ears my land
spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop If I be his
cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and
blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood
is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend If men
could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in
marriage for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the
heads are both one they may jowl horns together like any deer
CLOWN A prophet I madam and I speak the truth the next way
For I the ballad will repeat
Which men full true shall find
Your marriage comes by destiny
Your cuckoo sings by kind
STEWARD May it please you madam that he bid Helen come to you
Of her I am to speak
COUNTESS Sirrah tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her Helen
I mean
Fond done done fond
With that she sighed as she stood
With that she sighed as she stood
And gave this sentence then
Among nine bad if one be good
COUNTESS What one good in ten You corrupt the song sirrah
Though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will
wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart
I am going forsooth The business is for Helen to come hither
Exit
COUNTESS Well now
STEWARD I know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely
herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as
much love as she finds There is more owing her than is paid and
STEWARD Madam I was very late more near her than I think she
words to her own ears she thought I dare vow for her they
son Fortune she said was no goddess that had put such
difference betwixt their two estates Love no god that would not
extend his might only where qualities were level Diana no queen
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward This she
virgin exclaim in which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you
withal sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you
something to know it
misdoubt Pray you leave me Stall this in your bosom and I
thank you for your honest care I will speak with you further
anon                                           Exit STEWARD
Enter HELENA
Even so it was with me when I was young
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong
Our blood to us this to our blood is born
By our remembrances of days foregone
Such were our faults or then we thought them none
HELENA What is your pleasure madam
COUNTESS You know Helen
I am a mother to you
HELENA Mine honourable mistress
COUNTESS Nay a mother
That you start at it I say I am your mother
And put you in the catalogue of those
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds
That this distempered messenger of wet
Why that you are my daughter
HELENA That I am not
COUNTESS I say I am your mother
HELENA Pardon madam
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother
I am from humble he from honoured name
No note upon my parents his all noble
My master my dear lord he is and I
His servant live and will his vassal die
He must not be my brother
COUNTESS Nor I your mother
Indeed my mother Or were you both our mothers
I care no more for than I do for heaven
But I your daughter he must be my brother
So strive upon your pulse What pale again
Against the proclamation of thy passion
To say thou dost not Therefore tell me true
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviours
That in their kind they speak it only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue
If it be so you have wound a goodly clew
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail
To tell me truly
HELENA Good madam pardon me
COUNTESS Do you love my son
HELENA Your pardon noble mistress
COUNTESS Love you my son
HELENA Do not you love him madam
Whereof the world takes note Come come disclose
The state of your affection for your passions
HELENA Then I confess
Here on my knee before high heaven and you
That before you and next unto high heaven
I love your son
Be not offended for it hurts not him
By any token of presumptuous suit
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him
Yet never know how that desert should be
I know I love in vain strive against hope
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
Religious in mine error I adore
The sun that looks upon his worshipper
But knows of him no more My dearest madam
Let not your hate encounter with my love
For loving where you do but if yourself
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian
Was both herself and Love O then give pity
To her whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose
That seeks not to find that her search implies
To go to Paris
HELENA Madam I had
COUNTESS Wherefore Tell true
HELENA I will tell truth by grace itself I swear
You know my father left me some prescriptions
And manifest experience had collected
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
More than they were in note Amongst the rest
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
COUNTESS This was your motive
For Paris was it Speak
HELENA My lord your son made me to think of this
Else Paris and the medicine and the King
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then
COUNTESS But think you Helen
If you should tender your supposed aid
He would receive it He and his physicians
Are of a mind he that they cannot help him
They that they cannot help How shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin when the schools
The danger to itself
Of his profession that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By such a day and hour
HELENA Ay madam knowingly
COUNTESS Why Helen thou shalt have my leave and love
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss          Exeunt

ACT II SCENE 1
Flourish of cornets Enter the KING with divers young LORDS taking leave
for the Florentine war BERTRAM and PAROLLES ATTENDANTS
Do not throw from you And you my lords farewell
Share the advice betwixt you if both gain all
And is enough for both
And find your Grace in health
KING No no it cannot be and yet my heart
Will not confess he owes the malady
That doth my life besiege Farewell young lords
Whether I live or die be you the sons
Those bated that inherit but the fall
Not to woo honour but to wed it when
The bravest questant shrinks find what you seek
That fame may cry you aloud I say farewell
SECOND LORD Health at your bidding serve your Majesty
KING Those girls of Italy take heed of them
They say our French lack language to deny
If they demand beware of being captives
Before you serve
BOTH Our hearts receive your warnings
The KING retires attended
FIRST LORD O my sweet lord that you will stay behind us
PAROLLES Most admirable I have seen those wars
BERTRAM I am commanded here and kept a coil with
BERTRAM I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
PAROLLES Commit it Count
SECOND LORD I am your accessary and so farewell
FIRST LORD Farewell Captain
SECOND LORD Sweet Monsieur Parolles
PAROLLES Noble heroes my sword and yours are kin Good sparks and
lustrous a word good metals you shall find in the regiment of
the Spinii one Captain Spurio with his cicatrice an emblem of
war here on his sinister cheek it was this very sword
FIRST LORD We shall noble Captain
PAROLLES Mars dote on you for his novices       Exeunt LORDS
What will ye do
BERTRAM Stay the King
PAROLLES Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords you have
expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the
time there do muster true gait eat speak and move under the
the measure such are to be followed After them and take a more
dilated farewell
BERTRAM And I will do so
Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES
Enter LAFEU
And that at my bidding you could so stand up
KING I would I had so I had broke thy pate
LAFEU Good faith across
Of your infirmity
KING No
LAFEU O will you eat
No grapes my royal fox Yes but you will
My noble grapes an if my royal fox
Could reach them I have seen a medicine
Quicken a rock and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion whose simple touch
Is powerful to araise King Pepin nay
KING What her is this
If you will see her Now by my faith and honour
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance I have spoke
With one that in her sex her years profession
Than I dare blame my weakness Will you see her
For that is her demand and know her business
That done laugh well at me
KING Now good Lafeu
Bring in the admiration that we with the
May spend our wonder too or take off thine
And not be all day neither                       Exit LAFEU
KING Thus he his special nothing ever prologues
LAFEU Nay come your ways
KING This haste hath wings indeed
LAFEU Nay come your ways
This is his Majesty say your mind to him
A traitor you do look like but such traitors
That dare leave two together Fare you well            Exit
KING Now fair one does your business follow us
HELENA Ay my good lord
Gerard de Narbon was my father
In what he did profess well found
KING I knew him
HELENA The rather will I spare my praises towards him
Many receipts he gave me chiefly one
Which as the dearest issue of his practice
He bade me store up as a triple eye
Safer than mine own two more dear I have so
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness
KING We thank you maiden
But may not be so credulous of cure
When our most learned doctors leave us and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope
To empirics or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit to esteem
A senseless help when help past sense we deem
HELENA My duty then shall pay me for my pains
I will no more enforce mine office on you
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one to bear me back again
As one near death to those that wish him live
I knowing all my peril thou no art
HELENA What I can do can do no hurt to try
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown
When judges have been babes Great floods have flown
From simple sources and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits
KING I must not hear thee Fare thee well kind maid
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
It is not so with Him that all things knows
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men
Dear sir to my endeavours give consent
Of heaven not me make an experiment
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure
KING Art thou so confident Within what space
HELENA The greatest Grace lending grace
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly
Health shall live free and sickness freely die
KING Upon thy certainty and confidence
HELENA Tax of impudence
With vilest torture let my life be ended
KING Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense sense saves another way
Thy life is dear for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate
Youth beauty wisdom courage all
That happiness and prime can happy call
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate
Sweet practiser thy physic I will try
That ministers thine own death if I die
HELENA If I break time or flinch in property
Of what I spoke unpitied let me die
But if I help what do you promise me
KING Make thy demand
HELENA But will you make it even
KING Ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven
HELENA Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state
But such a one thy vassal whom I know
Is free for me to ask thee to bestow
So make the choice of thy own time for I
More should I question thee and more I must
Though more to know could not be more to trust
Give me some help here ho If thou proceed
As high as word my deed shall match thy deed
ACT II SCENE 2
Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
COUNTESS Come on sir I shall now put you to the height of your
breeding
CLOWN I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught I know my
business is but to the court
COUNTESS To the court Why what place make you special when you
put off that with such contempt But to the court
CLOWN Truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he may
cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip
nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were not for
the court but for me I have an answer will serve all men
buttock the quatch buttock the brawn buttock or any buttock
COUNTESS Will your answer serve fit to all questions
CLOWN As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your
forefinger as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday a morris for Mayday
as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding
mouth nay as the pudding to his skin
COUNTESS Have you I say an answer of such fitness for all
questions
CLOWN From below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit
any question
COUNTESS It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit
all demands
CLOWN But a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should
if I am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn
COUNTESS To be young again if we could I will be a fool in
question hoping to be the wiser by your answer I pray you sir
are you a courtier
hundred of them
COUNTESS Sir I am a poor friend of yours that loves you
COUNTESS I think sir you can eat none of this homely meat
whipping You would answer very well to a whipping if you were
COUNTESS I play the noble housewife with the time
To entertain it so merrily with a fool
COUNTESS An end sir To your business give Helen this
And urge her to a present answer back
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son This is not much
CLOWN Not much commendation to them
COUNTESS Not much employment for you You understand me
CLOWN Most fruitfully I am there before my legs
COUNTESS Haste you again                              Exeunt
ACT II SCENE 3
Enter BERTRAM LAFEU and PAROLLES
LAFEU They say miracles are past and we have our philosophical
persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and
causeless Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear
out in our latter times
PAROLLES Right so I say
LAFEU Uncertain life and sure death
PAROLLES Just you say well so would I have said
LAFEU I may truly say it is a novelty to the world
PAROLLES It is indeed If you will have it in showing you shall
LAFEU Very hand of heaven
PAROLLES Ay so I say
PAROLLES And debile minister great power great transcendence
which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone
LAFEU Generally thankful
Enter KING HELENA and ATTENDANTS
PAROLLES I would have said it you say well Here comes the King
coranto
PAROLLES Mort du vinaigre Is not this Helen
KING Go call before me all the lords in court
Exit an ATTENDANT
Which but attends thy naming
Enter three or four LORDS
Fair maid send forth thine eye This youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing
I have to use Thy frank election make
Thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
HELENA To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall when love please Marry to each but one
And writ as little beard
KING Peruse them well
Not one of those but had a noble father
HELENA Gentlemen
ALL We understand it and thank heaven for you
HELENA I am a simple maid and therein wealthiest
That I protest I simply am a maid
Please it your Majesty I have done already
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever
KING Make choice and see
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
HELENA Now Dian from thy altar do I fly
And to imperial Love that god most high
Do my sighs stream Sir will you hear my suit
FIRST LORD And grant it
HELENA Thanks sir all the rest is mute
life
HELENA The honour sir that flames in your fair eyes
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes and her humble love
SECOND LORD No better if you please
HELENA My wish receive
Which great Love grant and so I take my leave
HELENA Be not afraid that I your hand should take
Blessing upon your vows and in your bed
Find fairer fortune if you ever wed
HELENA You are too young too happy and too good
To make yourself a son out of my blood
FOURTH LORD Fair one I think not so

Me and my service ever whilst I live
Into your guiding power This is the man
BERTRAM My wife my liege I shall beseech your Highness
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes
What she has done for me
BERTRAM Yes my good lord
But never hope to know why I should marry her
BERTRAM But follows it my lord to bring me down
Must answer for your raising I know her well
Rather corrupt me ever
I can build up Strange is it that our bloods
Would quite confound distinction yet stand off
In differences so mighty If she be
Of virtue for the name but do not so
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed
It is a dropsied honour Good alone
Is good without a name Vileness is so
The property by what it is should go
Not by the title She is young wise fair
And is not like the sire Honours thrive
When rather from our acts we them derive
A lying trophy and as oft is dumb
If thou canst like this creature as a maid
I can create the rest Virtue and she
Is her own dower honour and wealth from me
Let the rest go
I must produce my power Here take her hand
Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert that canst not dream
We poising us in her defective scale
Shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow Check thy contempt
Obey our will which travails in thy good
Believe not thy disdain but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee in the name of justice
Without all terms of pity Speak thine answer
BERTRAM Pardon my gracious lord for I submit
My fancy to your eyes When I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it I find that she which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now
The praised of the King who so ennobled
KING Take her by the hand
And tell her she is thine to whom I promise
A counterpoise if not to thy estate
A balance more replete
BERTRAM I take her hand
KING Good fortune and the favour of the King
Smile upon this contract whose ceremony
Shall more attend upon the coming space
Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES who stay behind

LAFEU I must tell thee sirrah I write man to which title age

PAROLLES What I dare too well do I dare not do
LAFEU I did think thee for two ordinaries to be a pretty wise
fellow thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel it might
pass Yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly
dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burden I
have now found thee when I lose thee again I care not yet art
worth
LAFEU Do not plunge thyself too far in anger lest thou hasten thy
window of lattice fare thee well thy casement I need not open

LAFEU Ay with all my heart and thou art worthy of it

PAROLLES Well I shall be wiser

have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee or rather my
PAROLLES My lord you do me most insupportable vexation
LAFEU I would it were hell pains for thy sake and my poor doing
eternal for doing I am past as I will by thee in what motion
age will give me leave                                 Exit
PAROLLES Well thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me
scurvy old filthy scurvy lord Well I must be patient there

reservation of your wrongs He is my good lord whom I serve

LAFEU Who God
PAROLLES Ay sir

themselves upon thee
PAROLLES This is hard and undeserved measure my lord
LAFEU Go to sir you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel

you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the
commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry You are

He wears his honour in a box unseen
Spending his manly marrow in her arms
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her
And wherefore I am fled write to the King
That which I durst not speak His present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields
Where noble fellows strike War is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife
PAROLLES Will this capriccio hold in thee art sure

Therefore away and leave her bravely go

HELENA I hope sir I have your good will to have mine own good
fortunes
PAROLLES You had my prayers to lead them on and to keep them on
have them still O my knave how does my old lady
CLOWN So that you had her wrinkles and I her money I would she
did as you say
PAROLLES Why I say nothing
nothing and to have nothing is to be a great part of your
title which is within a very little of nothing
PAROLLES Go to thou art a witty fool I have found thee
CLOWN Did you find me in yourself sir or were you taught to find
me The search sir was profitable and much fool may you find
laughter
A very serious business calls on him
The great prerogative and rite of love
Which as your due time claims he does acknowledge
Which they distil now in the curbed time
And pleasure drown the brim
And make this haste as your own good proceeding
May make it probable need
HELENA What more commands he
Attend his further pleasure
HELENA In everything I wait upon his will
PAROLLES I shall report it so
HELENA I pray you                              Exit PAROLLES
Come sirrah                                         Exeunt

Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM
LAFEU But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier
BERTRAM Yes my lord and of very valiant approof
LAFEU You have it from his own deliverance
BERTRAM And by other warranted testimony
LAFEU Then my dial goes not true I took this lark for a bunting
BERTRAM I do assure you my lord he is very great in knowledge
and accordingly valiant
against his valour and my state that way is dangerous since I
cannot yet find in my heart to repent Here he comes I pray you
make us friends I will pursue the amity
Enter PAROLLES
PAROLLES Sir
very good tailor
PAROLLES She is
BERTRAM I have writ my letters casketed my treasure
When I should take possession of the bride
End ere I do begin
LAFEU A good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner
thousand nothings with should be once heard and thrice beaten
God save you Captain
BERTRAM Is there any unkindness between my lord and you monsieur
displeasure
again rather than suffer question for your residence
BERTRAM It may be you have mistaken him my lord
Fare you well my lord and believe this of me there can be no
kernal in this light nut the soul of this man is his clothes
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence I have kept of them
tame and know their natures Farewell monsieur I have spoken
better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand but we
must do good against evil                              Exit
PAROLLES An idle lord I swear
BERTRAM I think so
PAROLLES Why do you not know him
BERTRAM Yes I do know him well and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass Here comes my clog
Enter HELENA
HELENA I have sir as I was commanded from you
For present parting only he desires
Some private speech with you
BERTRAM I shall obey his will
You must not marvel Helen at my course
Which holds not colour with the time nor does
The ministration and required office
For such a business therefore am I found
So much unsettled This drives me to entreat you
That presently you take your way for home
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not This to my mother
I leave you to your wisdom
HELENA Sir I can nothing say
But that I am your most obedient servant
BERTRAM Come come no more of that
HELENA And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
To equal my great fortune
BERTRAM Let that go
My haste is very great Farewell hie home
HELENA Pray sir your pardon
BERTRAM Well what would you say
HELENA I am not worthy of the wealth I owe
But like a timorous thief most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own
BERTRAM What would you have
HELENA Something and scarce so much nothing indeed
I would not tell you what I would my lord
Faith yes
Strangers and foes do sunder and not kiss
BERTRAM I pray you stay not but in haste to horse
HELENA I shall not break your bidding good my lord
BERTRAM Where are my other men monsieur
Farewell                                        Exit HELENA
Go thou toward home where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum
Away and for our flight
PAROLLES Bravely coragio                             Exeunt

Flourish Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE attended two
FRENCH LORDS with a TROOP OF SOLDIERS
DUKE So that from point to point now have you hear
The fundamental reasons of this war
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after
FIRST LORD Holy seems the quarrel
On the opposer
DUKE Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers
SECOND LORD Good my lord
The reasons of our state I cannot yield
But like a common and an outward man
That the great figure of a council frames
Say what I think of it since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
DUKE Be it his pleasure
FIRST LORD But I am sure the younger of our nature
That surfeit on their ease will day by day
Come here for physic
DUKE Welcome shall they be
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle You know your places well
When better fall for your avails they fell
ACT III SCENE 2
Enter COUNTESS and CLOWN
comes not along with her
CLOWN By my troth I take my young lord to be a very melancholy
man
COUNTESS By what observance I pray you
CLOWN Why he will look upon his boot and sing mend the ruff and
sing ask questions and sing pick his teeth and sing I know a
man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor for a
song
COUNTESS Let me see what he writes and when he means to come
CLOWN I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court Our old ling
and I begin to love as an old man loves money with no stomach
COUNTESS What have we here
recovered the King and undone me I have wedded her not bedded
away know it before the report come If there be breadth enough
in the world I will hold a long distance My duty to you
Your unfortunate son
This is not well rash and unbridled boy
To fly the favours of so good a king
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprizing of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire
CLOWN O madam yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers
and my young lady
CLOWN Nay there is some comfort in the news some comfort your
CLOWN So say I madam if he run away as I hear he does the
the getting of children Here they come will tell you more For my
part I only hear your son was run away                Exit
Enter HELENA and the two FRENCH GENTLEMEN
SECOND GENTLEMAN Save you good madam
HELENA Madam my lord is gone for ever gone
FIRST GENTLEMAN Do not say so
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief
That the first face of neither on the start
We met him thitherward for thence we came
And after some dispatch in hand at court
Thither we bend again
never shall come off and show me a child begotten of thy body
This is a dreadful sentence
COUNTESS Brought you this letter gentlemen
FIRST GENTLEMAN Ay madam
COUNTESS I prithee lady have a better cheer
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine
But I do wash his name out of my blood
And thou art all my child Towards Florence is he
FIRST GENTLEMAN Ay madam
COUNTESS And to be a soldier
The Duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims
COUNTESS Return you thither
SECOND GENTLEMAN Ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed
COUNTESS Find you that there
HELENA Ay madam
his heart was not consenting to
COUNTESS Nothing in France until he have no wife
But only she and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress Who was with him
SECOND GENTLEMAN A servant only and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known
COUNTESS Parolles was it not
SECOND GENTLEMAN Ay my good lady he
COUNTESS A very tainted fellow and full of wickedness
With his inducement
SECOND GENTLEMAN Indeed good lady
The fellow has a deal of that too much
Which holds him much to have
I will entreat you when you see my son
To tell him that his sword can never win
Written to bear along
FIRST GENTLEMAN We serve you madam
In that and all your worthiest affairs
COUNTESS Not so but as we change our courtesies
Will you draw near            Exeunt COUNTESS and GENTLEMEN
Nothing in France until he has no wife
Thou shalt have none Rousillon none in France
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
That drive thee from the sportive court where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark
Of smoky muskets O you leaden messengers
That ride upon the violent speed of fire
That sings with piercing do not touch my lord
Whoever shoots at him I set him there
Whoever charges on his forward breast
And though I kill him not I am the cause
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once No come thou home Rousillon
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar
As oft it loses all I will be gone
My being here it is that holds thee hence
The air of paradise did fan the house
That pitiful rumour may report my flight
To consolate thine ear Come night end day
ACT III SCENE 3
Flourish Enter the DUKE OF FLORENCE BERTRAM PAROLLES SOLDIERS
drum and trumpets
DUKE The General of our Horse thou art and we
Great in our hope lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune
BERTRAM Sir it is
A charge too heavy for my strength but yet
DUKE Then go thou forth
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm
As thy auspicious mistress
BERTRAM This very day
Great Mars I put myself into thy file
Make me but like my thoughts and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum hater of love                   Exeunt
ACT III SCENE 4
Enter COUNTESS and STEWARD
COUNTESS Alas and would you take the letter of her
Might you not know she would do as she has done
By sending me a letter Read it again
Ambitious love hath so in me offended
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon
With sainted vow my faults to have amended
Write write that from the bloody course of war
My dearest master your dear son may hie
Bless him at home in peace whilst I from far
His name with zealous fervour sanctify
His taken labours bid him me forgive
I his despiteful Juno sent him forth
From courtly friends with camping foes to live
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth
He is too good and fair for death and me
COUNTESS Ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words
Rinaldo you did never lack advice so much
As letting her pass so had I spoke with her
I could have well diverted her intents
Which thus she hath prevented
STEWARD Pardon me madam
Pursuit would be but vain
COUNTESS What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband He cannot thrive
Unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice Write write Rinaldo
To this unworthy husband of his wife
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light My greatest grief
Though little he do feel it set down sharply
Dispatch the most convenient messenger
When haply he shall hear that she is gone
He will return and hope I may that she
Hearing so much will speed her foot again
Led hither by pure love Which of them both
Is dearest to me I have no skill in sense
To make distinction Provide this messenger
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak
Grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak     Exeunt
ACT III SCENE 5
Without the walls of Florence
A tucket afar off Enter an old WIDOW OF FLORENCE her daughter DIANA
VIOLENTA and MARIANA with other CITIZENS

We have lost our labour they are gone a contrary way Hark you

honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as
honesty
WIDOW I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a
gentleman his companion
MARIANA I know that knave hang him one Parolles a filthy
officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl Beware of
them Diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all
these engines of lust are not the things they go under many a
maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that
so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood cannot for all that
dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that
threatens them I hope I need not to advise you further but I
hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there
were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost
DIANA You shall not need to fear me
Enter HELENA in the dress of a pilgrim
WIDOW I hope so Look here comes a pilgrim I know she will lie

WIDOW Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service
HELENA His name I pray you
DIANA The Count Rousillon Know you such a one
HELENA But by the ear that hears most nobly of him
His face I know not
Against his liking Think you it is so
HELENA Ay surely mere the truth I know his lady
DIANA There is a gentleman that serves the Count
Reports but coarsely of her
DIANA Monsieur Parolles
HELENA O I believe with him
In argument of praise or to the worth
Of the great Count himself she is too mean
To have her name repeated all her deserving
Is a reserved honesty and that
DIANA Alas poor lady
Of a detesting lord
Her heart weighs sadly This young maid might do her
HELENA How do you mean
May be the amorous Count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose
WIDOW He does indeed
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid
In honestest defence
Enter with drum and colours BERTRAM PAROLLES and the
whole ARMY
MARIANA The gods forbid else
WIDOW So now they come

Camp before Florence
Enter BERTRAM and the two FRENCH LORDS
FIRST LORD If your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more
in your respect
SECOND LORD On my life my lord a bubble
BERTRAM Do you think I am so far deceived in him
SECOND LORD Believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge
most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly
FIRST LORD It were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his
virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty
business in a main danger fail you
BERTRAM I would I knew in what particular action to try him
FIRST LORD None better than to let him fetch off his drum which
you hear him so confidently undertake to do
SECOND LORD I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise
him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy
We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other
but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when
we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship present at
his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in
the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and
deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that
with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my
judgment in anything
FIRST LORD O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he
entertainment your inclining cannot be removed Here he comes
Enter PAROLLES
SECOND LORD O for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of
his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand
BERTRAM How now monsieur This drum sticks sorely in your
disposition
excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own
wings and to rend our own soldiers
service it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not
have prevented if he had been there to command
BERTRAM Well we cannot greatly condemn our success
Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to
be recovered
PAROLLES It might have been recovered
BERTRAM It might but it is not now
PAROLLES It is to be recovered But that the merit of service is
seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have
your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour
again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise
and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit If you
speed well in it the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to
you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost
syllable of our worthiness
PAROLLES By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it
BERTRAM But you must not now slumber in it
down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself
into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further
from me
BERTRAM May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it
PAROLLES I know not what the success will be my lord but the
attempt I vow
will subscribe for thee Farewell
PAROLLES I love not many words                          Exit
SECOND LORD No more than a fish loves water Is not this a strange
fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this
business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do
FIRST LORD You do not know him my lord as we do Certain it is
escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out
you have him ever after
BERTRAM Why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that
so seriously he does address himself unto
SECOND LORD None in the world but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies But we have almost
he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you
shall see this very night
SECOND LORD I must go look my twigs he shall be caught
BERTRAM Your brother he shall go along with me
BERTRAM Now will I lead you to the house and show you
The lass I spoke of
And found her wondrous cold but I sent to her
Will you go see her
FIRST LORD With all my heart my lord                 Exeunt
ACT III SCENE 7
Enter HELENA and WIDOW
HELENA If you misdoubt me that I am not she
I know not how I shall assure you further
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon
Nothing acquainted with these businesses
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act
HELENA Nor would I wish you
FIRST give me trust the Count he is my husband
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word and then you cannot
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow
Err in bestowing it
WIDOW I should believe you
HELENA Take this purse of gold
And let me buy your friendly help thus far
When I have found it The Count he woos your daughter
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty
Now his important blood will nought deny
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it This ring he holds
In most rich choice yet in his idle fire
To buy his will it would not seem too dear
WIDOW Now I see
The bottom of your purpose
HELENA You see it lawful then It is no more
But that your daughter ere she seems as won
Desires this ring appoints him an encounter
In fine delivers me to fill the time
Herself most chastely absent After this
WIDOW I have yielded
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent Every night he comes
To her unworthiness It nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves for he persists
Let us assay our plot which if it speed
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
And lawful meaning in a lawful act
Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact

ACT IV SCENE 1
Without the Florentine camp
Enter SECOND FRENCH LORD with five or six other SOLDIERS in ambush
When you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will
though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must
not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we
must produce for an interpreter
SECOND LORD Art not acquainted with him Knows he not thy voice
FIRST SOLDIER No sir I warrant you
neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of
his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we
gabble enough and good enough As for you interpreter you must
seem very politic But couch ho here he comes to beguile two
hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges
Enter PAROLLES
enough to go home What shall I say I have done It must be a
very plausive invention that carries it They begin to smoke me
tongue is too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars
before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my
tongue
guilty of
PAROLLES What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery
of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and
knowing I had no such purpose I must give myself some hurts and
say I got them in exploit Yet slight ones will not carry it
SECOND LORD Is it possible he should know what he is and be that
he is
PAROLLES I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn
or the breaking of my Spanish sword
SECOND LORD We cannot afford you so
PAROLLES Or the baring of my beard and to say it was in
stratagem
SECOND LORD Hardly serve
SECOND LORD How deep
PAROLLES Thirty fathom
SECOND LORD Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed
SECOND LORD Throca movousus cargo cargo cargo
ALL Cargo cargo cargo villianda par corbo cargo
PAROLLES O ransom ransom Do not hide mine eyes
FIRST SOLDIER Boskos thromuldo boskos
And I shall lose my life for want of language
If there be here German or Dane Low Dutch
Italian or French let him speak to me
FIRST SOLDIER Boskos vauvado I understand thee and can speak thy
seventeen poniards are at thy bosom
PAROLLES O
FIRST SOLDIER O pray pray pray Manka revania dulche
SECOND LORD Oscorbidulchos volivorco
FIRST SOLDIER The General is content to spare thee yet
To gather from thee Haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life
PAROLLES O let me live
Which you will wonder at
FIRST SOLDIER But wilt thou faithfully
PAROLLES If I do not damn me
FIRST SOLDIER Acordo linta
Come on thou art granted space
Exit PAROLLES guarded A short alarum within
SECOND LORD Go tell the Count Rousillon and my brother
We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled
Till we do hear from them
SECOND SOLDIER Captain I will
Inform on that
SECOND SOLDIER So I will sir
Exeunt
ACT IV SCENE 2
Enter BERTRAM and DIANA
BERTRAM They told me that your name was Fontibell
DIANA No my good lord Diana
BERTRAM Titled goddess
And worth it with addition But fair soul
In your fine frame hath love no quality
If the quick fire of youth light not your mind
You are no maiden but a monument
When you are dead you should be such a one
As you are now for you are cold and stern
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got
DIANA She then was honest
BERTRAM So should you be
DIANA No
My mother did but duty such my lord
As you owe to your wife
I prithee do not strive against my vows
Do thee all rights of service
DIANA Ay so you serve us
Till we serve you but when you have our roses
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
And mock us with our bareness
BERTRAM How have I sworn
What is not holy that we swear not by
When I did love you ill This has no holding
To swear by him whom I protest to love
That I will work against him Therefore your oaths
At least in my opinion
BERTRAM Change it change it
That you do charge men with Stand no more off
But give thyself unto my sick desires
Who then recovers Say thou art mine and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever
DIANA I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
To give it from me
DIANA Will you not my lord
Bequeathed down from many ancestors
In me to lose
Bequeathed down from many ancestors
In me to lose Thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part
Against your vain assault
BERTRAM Here take my ring
My house mine honour yea my life be thine
DIANA When midnight comes knock at my chamber window
Now will I charge you in the band of truth
Remain there but an hour nor speak to me
My reasons are most strong and you shall know them
Another ring that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds
Adieu till then then fail not You have won
A wife of me though there my hope be done
BERTRAM A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee
Exit
DIANA For which live long to thank both heaven and me
You may so in the end
My mother told me just how he would woo
Have the like oaths He had sworn to marry me
When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid
Marry that will I live and die a maid
To cozen him that would unjustly win                   Exit
ACT IV SCENE 3
The Florentine camp
Enter the two FRENCH LORDS and two or three SOLDIERS
almost into another man
SECOND LORD He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off
so good a wife and so sweet a lady
FIRST LORD Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure
him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly
with you
of it
FIRST LORD He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence
of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in
the spoil of her honour He hath given her his monumental ring
and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
SECOND LORD Now God delay our rebellion As we are ourselves
what things are we
FIRST LORD Merely our own traitors And as in the common course of
all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain
himself
SECOND LORD Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our
FIRST LORD Not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
SECOND LORD That approaches apace I would gladly have him see his
judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit
FIRST LORD We will not meddle with him till he come for his
presence must be the whip of the other
SECOND LORD In the meantime what hear you of these wars
FIRST LORD I hear there is an overture of peace
SECOND LORD Nay I assure you a peace concluded
FIRST LORD What will Count Rousillon do then Will he travel
higher or return again into France
SECOND LORD I perceive by this demand you are not altogether
of his counsel
FIRST LORD Let it be forbid sir So should I be a great deal
of his act
SECOND LORD Sir his wife some two months since fled from his
house Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand
which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she
became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last
breath and now she sings in heaven
FIRST LORD How is this justified
SECOND LORD The stronger part of it by her own letters which
makes her story true even to the point of her death Her death
itself which could not be her office to say is come was
FIRST LORD Hath the Count all this intelligence
SECOND LORD Ay and the particular confirmations point from
point to the full arming of the verity
SECOND LORD How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our
losses
FIRST LORD And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in
SECOND LORD The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill
together Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them
our virtues
Enter a MESSENGER
SERVANT He met the Duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken
a solemn leave His lordship will next morning for France The
Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King
SECOND LORD They shall be no more than needful there if they were
more than they can commend
Enter BERTRAM
length apiece by an abstract of success I have congied with the
convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many
nicer needs The last was the greatest but that I have not ended
yet
SECOND LORD If the business be of any difficulty and this morning
your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship
BERTRAM I mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it
hereafter But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and
the Soldier Come bring forth this counterfeit module has
stocks all night poor gallant knave
spurs so long How does he carry himself
SECOND LORD I have told your lordship already the stocks carry
him But to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like
Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his
SECOND LORD His confession is taken and it shall be read to his
have the patience to hear it
Enter PAROLLES guarded and
FIRST SOLDIER as interpreter
BERTRAM A plague upon him muffled He can say nothing of me
SECOND LORD Hush hush Hoodman comes Portotartarossa
FIRST SOLDIER He calls for the tortures What will you say without
PAROLLES I will confess what I know without constraint if ye
pinch me like a pasty I can say no more
FIRST SOLDIER Bosko chimurcho
SECOND LORD Boblibindo chicurmurco
FIRST SOLDIER YOU are a merciful general Our General bids you
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note
PAROLLES And truly as I hope to live
PAROLLES Five or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable
The troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor
rogues upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live
FIRST SOLDIER Shall I set down your answer so
will
theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the
chape of his dagger
FIRST LORD I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his
apparel neatly
marvellous poor
What say you to that
PAROLLES By my troth sir if I were to live this present hour I
will tell true Let me see Spurio a hundred and fifty
Sebastian so many Corambus so many Jaques so many Guiltian
Cosmo Lodowick and Gratii two hundred fifty each mine own
company Chitopher Vaumond Bentii two hundred fifty each so
to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the
snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to
pieces
BERTRAM What shall be done to him
SECOND LORD Nothing but let him have thanks Demand of him my
condition and what credit I have with the Duke
reputation is with the Duke what his valour honesty expertness
in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with
you to this What do you know of it
PAROLLES I beseech you let me answer to the particular of the
FIRST SOLDIER Do you know this Captain Dumain
dumb innocent that could not say him nay
BERTRAM Nay by your leave hold your hands though I know his
brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
camp
PAROLLES Upon my knowledge he is and lousy
SECOND LORD Nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your
lordship anon
FIRST SOLDIER What is his reputation with the Duke
PAROLLES The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
I think I have his letter in my pocket
PAROLLES In good sadness I do not know either it is there or it
PAROLLES I do not know if it be it or no
BERTRAM Our interpreter does it well
SECOND LORD Excellently
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one Diana to take
heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon a foolish idle
boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up
again
of the maid for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and
lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all
the fry it finds
After he scores he never pays the score
Half won is match well made match and well make it
And say a soldier Dian told thee this
Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss
Who pays before but not when he does owe it
forehead
FIRST LORD This is your devoted friend sir the manifold
linguist and the amnipotent soldier
cat to me
fain to hang you
PAROLLES My life sir in any case Not that I am afraid to die
but that my offences being many I would repent out the
stocks or anywhere so I may live
his reputation with the Duke and to his valour what is his
honesty
PAROLLES He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes
and ravishments he parallels Nessus He professes not keeping of
sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool
in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about
him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have
but little more to say sir of his honesty He has everything
that an honest man should not have what an honest man should
have he has nothing
SECOND LORD I begin to love him for this
BERTRAM For this description of thine honesty A pox upon him For
FIRST SOLDIER What say you to his expertness in war
PAROLLES Faith sir has led the drum before the English
I know not except in that country he had the honour to be the
this I am not certain
redeems him
FIRST SOLDIER His qualities being at this poor price I need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt
remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually
FIRST LORD Why does he ask him of me
the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil He
excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one
of the best that is In a retreat he outruns any lackey marry
in coming on he has the cramp
FIRST SOLDIER If your life be saved will you undertake to betray
the Florentine
PAROLLES Ay and the Captain of his Horse Count Rousillon
pleasure
Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of
that lascivious young boy the Count have I run into this danger
Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken
FIRST SOLDIER There is no remedy sir but you must die
secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men
very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore
you must die Come headsman of with his head
PAROLLES O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death
FIRST SOLDIER That shall you and take your leave of all your
BERTRAM Good morrow noble Captain
FIRST LORD God bless you Captain Parolles
SECOND LORD God save you noble Captain
FIRST LORD Captain what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu I am
for France
SECOND LORD Good Captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon An I were not
Exeunt BERTRAM and LORDS
FIRST SOLDIER You are undone Captain all but your scarf that
FIRST SOLDIER If you could find out a country where but women were
that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent
nation Fare ye well sir I am for France too we shall speak of
you there                                Exit with SOLDIERS
PAROLLES Yet am I thankful If my heart were great
But I will eat and drink and sleep as soft
As captain shall Simply the thing I am
Shall make me live Who knows himself a braggart
Let him fear this for it will come to pass
That every braggart shall be found an ass
Rust sword cool blushes and Parolles live
ACT IV SCENE 4
Enter HELENA WIDOW and DIANA
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Ere I can perfect mine intents to kneel
Time was I did him a desired office
Dear almost as his life which gratitude
His Grace is at Marseilles to which place
We have convenient convoy You must know
I am supposed dead The army breaking
My husband hies him home where heaven aiding
And by the leave of my good lord the King
WIDOW Gentle madam
You never had a servant to whose trust
Your business was more welcome
HELENA Nor you mistress
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
To recompense your love Doubt not but heaven
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a husband But O strange men
That can such sweet use make of what they hate
Defiles the pitchy night So lust doth play
With what it loathes for that which is away
But more of this hereafter You Diana
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf
DIANA Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions I am yours
Upon your will to suffer
HELENA Yet I pray you
But with the word the time will bring on summer
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns
And be as sweet as sharp We must away

ACT V SCENE 3
Flourish Enter KING COUNTESS LAFEU the two FRENCH LORDS with ATTENDANTS
KING We lost a jewel of her and our esteem
Was made much poorer by it but your son
Her estimation home
And I beseech your Majesty to make it
I have forgiven and forgotten all
Though my revenges were high bent upon him
But first I beg my pardon the young lord
Did to his Majesty his mother and his lady
Offence of mighty note but to himself
The greatest wrong of all He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive
KING Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither
All repetition Let him not ask our pardon
The nature of his great offence is dead
And deeper than oblivion do we bury
A stranger no offender and inform him
GENTLEMAN I shall my liege                 Exit GENTLEMAN
KING What says he to your daughter Have you spoke
LAFEU All that he is hath reference to your Highness
KING Then shall we have a match I have letters sent me
That sets him high in fame
Enter BERTRAM
KING I am not a day of season
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once But to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth
The time is fair again
Dear sovereign pardon to me
KING All is whole
Not one word more of the consumed time
Steals ere we can effect them You remember
The daughter of this lord
BERTRAM Admiringly my liege At first
I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart
Durst make too bold herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object Thence it came
The dust that did offend it
That thou didst love her strikes some scores away
From the great compt but love that comes too late
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried
To the great sender turns a sour offence
Make trivial price of serious things we have
Not knowing them until we know their grave
Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin
COUNTESS Which better than the first O dear heaven bless
Or ere they meet in me O nature cesse
Must be digested give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter
That she may quickly come
By my old beard
Was a sweet creature such a ring as this
I saw upon her finger
BERTRAM Hers it was not
KING Now pray you let me see it for mine eye
This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen
I bade her if her fortunes ever stood
Necessitied to help that by this token
I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her
Of what should stead her most
BERTRAM My gracious sovereign
The ring was never hers
COUNTESS Son on my life
LAFEU I am sure I saw her wear it
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me
Of her that threw it Noble she was and thought
I could not answer in that course of honour
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again
KING Plutus himself
Whoever gave it you Then if you know
That you are well acquainted with yourself
That she would never put it from her finger
Upon her great disaster
BERTRAM She never saw it
Which I would fain shut out If it should prove
And she is dead which nothing but to close
Her eyes myself could win me to believe
More than to see this ring Take him away
Shall tax my fears of little vanity
BERTRAM If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence
Where she yet never was                       Exit guarded
Enter a GENTLEMAN
GENTLEMAN Gracious sovereign
Whether I have been to blame or no I know not
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself I undertook it
Of the poor suppliant who by this I know
Is here attending her business looks in her
With an importing visage and she told me
In a sweet verbal brief it did concern
Your Highness with herself
when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won me Now is the
Count Rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my
and I follow him to his country for justice Grant it me O King
in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor
maid is undone
KING The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu
Go speedily and bring again the Count
Exeunt ATTENDANTS
I am afeard the life of Helen lady
COUNTESS Now justice on the doers
Enter BERTRAM guarded
KING I wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship
Yet you desire to marry
Enter WIDOW and DIANA
DIANA I am my lord a wretched Florentine
Derived from the ancient Capilet
My suit as I do understand you know
And therefore know how far I may be pitied
WIDOW I am her mother sir whose age and honour
Both suffer under this complaint we bring
And both shall cease without your remedy
KING Come hither Count do you know these women
BERTRAM My lord I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them Do they charge me further
DIANA Why do you look so strange upon your wife
DIANA If you shall marry
You give away this hand and that is mine
You give away myself which is known mine
For I by vow am so embodied yours
That she which marries you must marry me
Either both or none
my daughter you are no husband for her
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here
KING Sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend
Till your deeds gain them Fairer prove your honour
Than in my thought it lies
DIANA Good my lord
Ask him upon his oath if he does think
He had not my virginity
And was a common gamester to the camp
DIANA He does me wrong my lord if I were so
He might have bought me at a common price
Do not believe him o behold this ring
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel yet for all that
If I be one
Of six preceding ancestors that gem
KING Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it
DIANA I did my lord but loath am to produce
KING Find him and bring him hither        Exit an ATTENDANT
BERTRAM What of him
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
That will speak anything
KING She hath that ring of yours
She knew her distance and did angle for me
Madding my eagerness with her restraint
Are motives of more fancy and in fine
Her infinite cunning with her modern grace
And I had that which any inferior might
DIANA I must be patient
Send for your ring I will return it home
And give me mine again
BERTRAM I have it not
KING What ring was yours I pray you
DIANA Sir much like
The same upon your finger
KING Know you this ring This ring was his of late
DIANA And this was it I gave him being abed
KING The story then goes false you threw it him
Out of a casement
DIANA I have spoke the truth
Enter PAROLLES
BERTRAM My lord I do confess the ring was hers
KING You boggle shrewdly every feather starts you
Is this the man you speak of
DIANA Ay my lord
Not fearing the displeasure of your master
By him and by this woman here what know you
PAROLLES So please your Majesty my master hath been an honourable
gentleman tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen have
PAROLLES Faith sir he did love her but how
KING How I pray you
PAROLLES He did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman
KING How is that
KING As thou art a knave and no knave
What an equivocal companion is this
PAROLLES Yes so please your Majesty I did go between them as I
not what Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I
knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising
her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak
of therefore I will not speak what I know
KING Thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are
married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand
aside
This ring you say was yours
DIANA Ay my good lord
KING Where did you buy it Or who gave it you
DIANA It was not given me nor I did not buy it
KING Who lent it you
DIANA It was not lent me neither
KING Where did you find it then
DIANA I found it not
KING If it were yours by none of all these ways
How could you give it him
DIANA I never gave it him
pleasure
KING This ring was mine I gave it his first wife
DIANA It might be yours or hers for aught I know
KING Take her away I do not like her now
To prison with her And away with him
Thou diest within this hour
KING Take her away
KING I think thee now some common customer
Great King I am no strumpet by my life
KING She does abuse our ears to prison with her
DIANA Good mother fetch my bail Stay royal sir
Exit WIDOW
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for
And he shall surety me But for this lord
And at that time he got his wife with child
Dead though she be she feels her young one kick
And now behold the meaning
KING Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes
HELENA No my good lord
The name and not the thing
BERTRAM Both both o pardon
HELENA O my good lord when I was like this maid
I found you wondrous kind There is your ring
Will you be mine now you are doubly won
BERTRAM If she my liege can make me know this clearly
HELENA If it appear not plain and prove untrue
Deadly divorce step between me and you
O my dear mother do I see you living
Good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher So I
let thy curtsies alone they are scurvy ones
KING Let us from point to point this story know
To make the even truth in pleasure flow
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Of that and all the progress more and less
Resolvedly more leisure shall express
All yet seems well and if it end so meet
EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
All is well ended if this suit be won
That you express content which we will pay
With strife to please you day exceeding day
Ours be your patience then and yours our parts
Your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts
Exeunt omnes

SCENE
The Roman Empire
ACT I SCENE I
Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
The office and devotion of their view
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast reneges all temper
And is become the bellows and the fan
Flourish Enter ANTONY CLEOPATRA her LADIES the train
with eunuchs fanning her
Look where they come
Take but good note and you shall see in him
CLEOPATRA If it be love indeed tell me how much
ANTONY Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER News my good lord from Rome
ANTONY Grates me the sum
CLEOPATRA Nay hear them Antony
Fulvia perchance is angry or who knows
Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that
ANTONY How my love
CLEOPATRA Perchance Nay and most like
You must not stay here longer your dismission
Is come from Caesar therefore hear it Antony
Thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine
ANTONY Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch
Kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man The nobleness of life
On pain of punishment the world to weet
We stand up peerless
CLEOPATRA Excellent falsehood
Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her
Will be himself
Now for the love of Love and her soft hours
CLEOPATRA Hear the ambassadors
ANTONY Fie wrangling queen
To weep whose every passion fully strives
No messenger but thine and all alone
The qualities of people Come my queen
Last night you did desire it Speak not to us
Exeunt ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with the train
PHILO Sir sometimes when he is not Antony
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony
DEMETRIUS I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar who
Thus speaks of him at Rome but I will hope
SCENE II

Prithee how many boys and wenches must I have
SOOTHSAYER If every of your wishes had a womb
And fertile every wish a million
CHARMIAN Out fool I forgive thee for a witch

SOOTHSAYER Your fortunes are alike
IRAS But how but how Give me particulars
SOOTHSAYER I have said
IRAS Am I not an inch of fortune better than she
CHARMIAN Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than I
where would you choose it
fortune his fortune O let him marry a woman that cannot go
sweet Isis I beseech thee And let her die too and give him a
worse And let worse follow worse till the worst of all follow
him laughing to his grave fiftyfold a cuckold Good Isis hear
me this prayer though thou deny me a matter of more weight good
Isis I beseech thee
IRAS Amen Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people For as
a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded Therefore

CHARMIAN Amen
ALEXAS Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold they
Enter CLEOPATRA
ENOBARBUS Hush Here comes Antony
CHARMIAN Not he the Queen
CLEOPATRA Saw you my lord
ENOBARBUS No lady
CLEOPATRA Was he not here
CHARMIAN No madam
A Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus
ENOBARBUS Madam
ALEXAS Here at your service My lord approaches
Enter ANTONY with a MESSENGER and attendants
CLEOPATRA We will not look upon him Go with us
Exeunt CLEOPATRA ENOBARBUS and the rest
MESSENGER Fulvia thy wife first came into the field
ANTONY Against my brother Lucius
MESSENGER Ay
Whose better issue in the war from Italy
Upon the first encounter drave them
ANTONY Well what worst
MESSENGER The nature of bad news infects the teller
ANTONY When it concerns the fool or coward On
Who tells me true though in his tale lie death
Extended Asia from Euphrates
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia
ANTONY Antony thou wouldst say
MESSENGER O my lord
ANTONY Speak to me home mince not the general tongue
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds
When our quick minds lie still and our ills told us
Is as our earing Fare thee well awhile
MESSENGER At your noble pleasure                        Exit
ANTONY From Sicyon ho the news Speak there
SECOND ATTENDANT He stays upon your will
ANTONY Let him appear
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break
Or lose myself in dotage
Enter another MESSENGER with a letter
What are you
SECOND MESSENGER Fulvia thy wife is dead
ANTONY Where died she
SECOND MESSENGER In Sicyon
Her length of sickness with what else more serious
ANTONY Forbear me                             Exit MESSENGER
What our contempts doth often hurl from us
We wish it ours again the present pleasure
I must from this enchanting queen break off
Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know
My idleness doth hatch How now Enobarbus
ANTONY I must with haste from hence
ENOBARBUS Why then we kill all our women We see how mortal an
word
ANTONY I must be gone
ENOBARBUS Under a compelling occasion let women die It were pity
to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great
cause they should be esteemed nothing Cleopatra catching but
the least noise of this dies instantly I have seen her die
twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is mettle
in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a
celerity in dying
ENOBARBUS Alack sir no Her passions are made of nothing but the
finest part of pure love We cannot call her winds and waters
sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than
almanacs can report This cannot be cunning in her if it be she
ANTONY Would I had never seen her
ENOBARBUS O Sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of
work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited
your travel
ANTONY Fulvia is dead
ENOBARBUS Sir
ANTONY Fulvia is dead
ENOBARBUS Fulvia
ANTONY Dead
ENOBARBUS Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When it
pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it
shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that
when old robes are worn out there are members to make new If
there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut
consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and
indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
ANTONY The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence
on your abode
ANTONY No more light answers Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the Queen
And get her leave to part For not alone
The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches
Do strongly speak to us but the letters to
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands
The empire of the sea our slippery people
Till his deserts are past begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son who high in name and power
Higher than both in blood and life stands up
For the main soldier whose quality going on
To such whose place is under us requires
Our quick remove from hence
SCENE III
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and ALEXAS
CLEOPATRA Where is he
CHARMIAN I did not see him since
I did not send you If you find him sad
Say I am dancing if in mirth report
That I am sudden sick Quick and return        Exit ALEXAS
CHARMIAN Madam methinks if you did love him dearly
You do not hold the method to enforce
The like from him
CLEOPATRA What should I do I do not
CHARMIAN In each thing give him way cross him in nothing
CHARMIAN Tempt him not so too far I wish forbear
In time we hate that which we often fear
Enter ANTONY
But here comes Antony
CLEOPATRA I am sick and sullen
CLEOPATRA Help me away dear Charmian I shall fall
It cannot be thus long the sides of nature
Will not sustain it
CLEOPATRA Pray you stand farther from me
What says the married woman You may go
Would she had never given you leave to come
I have no power upon you hers you are
CLEOPATRA O never was there queen
I saw the treasons planted
CLEOPATRA Why should I think you can be mine and true
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods
Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness
Which break themselves in swearing
CLEOPATRA Nay pray you seek no colour for your going
But bid farewell and go When you sued staying
Then was the time for words No going then
Eternity was in our lips and eyes
But was a race of heaven They are so still
Or thou the greatest soldier of the world
ANTONY How now lady
CLEOPATRA I would I had thy inches Thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt
ANTONY Hear me queen
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile but my full heart
Remains in use with you Our Italy
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Upon the present state whose numbers threaten
And quietness grown sick of rest would purge
By any desperate change My more particular
And that which most with you should safe my going
CLEOPATRA Though age from folly could not give me freedom
It does from childishness Can Fulvia die
Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read
See when and where she died
CLEOPATRA O most false love
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water Now I see I see
The purposes I bear which are or cease
Thy soldier servant making peace or war
As thou affects
CLEOPATRA Cut my lace Charmian come
So Antony loves
ANTONY My precious queen forbear
And give true evidence to his love which stands
An honourable trial
CLEOPATRA So Fulvia told me
I prithee turn aside and weep for her
Then bid adieu to me and say the tears
Belong to Egypt Good now play one scene
Of excellent dissembling and let it look
Like perfect honour
CLEOPATRA You can do better yet but this is meetly
CLEOPATRA And target Still he mends
But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe
CLEOPATRA Courteous lord one word
O my oblivion is a very Antony
And I am all forgotten
ANTONY But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject I should take you
For idleness itself
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me
Since my becomings kill me when they do not
Eye well to you Your honour calls you hence
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly
And all the gods go with you Upon your sword
Sit laurel victory and smooth success
ANTONY Let us go Come
Our separation so abides and flies
That thou residing here goes yet with me
And I hence fleeting here remain with thee
Away                                                 Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter LEPIDUS and their train
CAESAR You may see Lepidus and henceforth know
Our great competitor From Alexandria
This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes
The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike
Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he hardly gave audience or
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow
LEPIDUS I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven
Than what he chooses
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy
To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave
To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet
As his composure must be rare indeed
No way excuse his foils when we do bear
His vacancy with his voluptuousness
Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure
And so rebel to judgment
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Thy biddings have been done and every hour
Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report
CAESAR I should have known no less
It hath been taught us from the primal state
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream
Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide
To rot itself with motion
MESSENGER Caesar I bring thee word
Menecrates and Menas famous pirates
Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind Many hot inroads
They make in Italy the borders maritime
Than could his war resisted
CAESAR Antony
Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once
Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel
Though daintily brought up with patience more
Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink
The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge
Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh
Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek
CAESAR Let his shames quickly
Assemble we immediate council Pompey
Thrives in our idleness
Both what by sea and land I can be able
To front this present time
CAESAR Till which encounter
It is my business too Farewell
LEPIDUS Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime
Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir
To let me be partaker
CAESAR Doubt not sir
I knew it for my bond                                Exeunt
SCENE V
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA Charmian
CHARMIAN Madam
CLEOPATRA Ha ha
Give me to drink mandragora
CHARMIAN Why madam
CLEOPATRA That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away
CHARMIAN You think of him too much
CHARMIAN Madam I trust not so
CLEOPATRA Thou eunuch Mardian
CLEOPATRA Not now to hear thee sing I take no pleasure
May not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections
MARDIAN Yes gracious madam
CLEOPATRA Indeed
MARDIAN Not in deed madam for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done
Yet have I fierce affections and think
What Venus did with Mars
CLEOPATRA O Charmian
Or does he walk or is he on his horse
O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony
For so he calls me Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison Think on me
When thou wast here above the ground I was
A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow
There would he anchor his aspect and die
With looking on his life
Enter ALEXAS
ALEXAS Sovereign of Egypt hail
CLEOPATRA How much unlike art thou Mark Antony
With his tinct gilded thee
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony
ALEXAS Last thing he did dear Queen
This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart
CLEOPATRA Mine ear must pluck it thence
This treasure of an oyster at whose foot
To mend the petty present I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms All the East
CLEOPATRA What was he sad or merry
Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
He was not sad for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his he was not merry
In Egypt with his joy but between both
The violence of either thee becomes
ALEXAS Ay madam twenty several messengers
Why do you send so thick
When I forget to send to Antony
Shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian
Welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian
Ever love Caesar so
CHARMIAN O that brave Caesar
CHARMIAN The valiant Caesar
CLEOPATRA By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men
CHARMIAN By your most gracious pardon
I sing but after you
CLEOPATRA My salad days
When I was green in judgment cold in blood
To say as I said then But come away
Get me ink and paper
He shall have every day a several greeting

ACT II SCENE I
Enter POMPEY MENECRATES and MENAS in warlike manner
POMPEY If the great gods be just they shall assist
The deeds of justest men
MENECRATES Know worthy Pompey
That what they do delay they not deny
POMPEY Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays
The thing we sue for
MENECRATES We ignorant of ourselves
Deny us for our good so find we profit
By losing of our prayers
POMPEY I shall do well
The people love me and the sea is mine
My powers are crescent and my auguring hope
In Egypt sits at dinner and will make
No wars without doors Caesar gets money where
He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both
Nor either cares for him
MENAS Caesar and Lepidus
Are in the field A mighty strength they carry
MENAS From Silvius sir
POMPEY He dreams I know they are in Rome together
Looking for Antony But all the charms of love
Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts
Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
Enter VARRIUS
How now Varrius
VARRIUS This is most certain that I shall deliver
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
A space for farther travel
POMPEY I could have given less matter
A better ear Menas I did not think
For such a petty war his soldiership
Is twice the other twain But let us rear
The higher our opinion that our stirring
MENAS I cannot hope
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together
POMPEY I know not Menas
How lesser enmities may give way to greater
For they have entertained cause enough
To draw their swords But how the fear of us
May cement their divisions and bind up
The petty difference we yet not know
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands
Come Menas                                          Exeunt
SCENE II
Rome The house of LEPIDUS
Enter ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
And shall become you well to entreat your captain
To soft and gentle speech
ENOBARBUS I shall entreat him
To answer like himself If Caesar move him
And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter
For private stomaching
ENOBARBUS Every time
LEPIDUS But small to greater matters must give way
ENOBARBUS Not if the small come first
LEPIDUS Your speech is passion
But pray you stir no embers up Here comes
The noble Antony
Enter ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
ENOBARBUS And yonder Caesar
Enter CAESAR MAECENAS and AGRIPPA
ANTONY If we compose well here to Parthia
Hark Ventidius
CAESAR I do not know Maecenas Ask Agrippa
LEPIDUS Noble friends
May it be gently heard When we debate
Our trivial difference loud we do commit
Murder in healing wounds Then noble partners
The rather for I earnestly beseech
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms
Were we before our arinies and to fight
CAESAR Welcome to Rome
ANTONY Thank you
CAESAR Sit
ANTONY Sit sir
ANTONY I learn you take things ill which are not so
Or being concern you not
If or for nothing or a little
Should say myself offended and with you
Once name you derogately when to sound your name
ANTONY My being in Egypt Caesar
CAESAR No more than my residing here at Rome
Might be to you in Egypt Yet if you there
Did practise on my state your being in Egypt
Might be my question
By what did here befall me Your wife and brother
Made wars upon me and their contestation
Was theme for you you were the word of war
ANTONY You do mistake your business my brother never
Did urge me in his act I did inquire it
And have my learning from some true reports
That drew their swords with you Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours
And make the wars alike against my stomach
Having alike your cause Of this my letters
As matter whole you have not to make it with
It must not be with this
CAESAR You praise yourself
By laying defects of judgment to me but
ANTONY Not so not so
Very necessity of this thought that I
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife
I would you had her spirit in such another
You may pace easy but not such a wife
ENOBARBUS Would we had all such wives that the men might go to
wars with the women
ANTONY So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar
Did you too much disquiet For that you must
But say I could not help it
CAESAR I wrote to you
When rioting in Alexandria you
Did pocket up my letters and with taunts
Did gibe my missive out of audience
ANTONY Sir
He fell upon me ere admitted Then
Three kings I had newly feasted and did want
I told him of myself which was as much
Be nothing of our strife if we contend
Out of our question wipe him
CAESAR You have broken
The article of your oath which you shall never
Have tongue to charge me with
LEPIDUS Soft Caesar
ANTONY No
Lepidus let him speak
The honour is sacred which he talks on now
The which you both denied
ANTONY Neglected rather
And then when poisoned hours had bound me up
From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may
Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power
Work without it Truth is that Fulvia
To have me out of Egypt made wars here
For which myself the ignorant motive do
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
To stoop in such a case
MAECENAS If it might please you to enforce no further
Were to remember that the present need
Speaks to atone you
LEPIDUS Worthily spoken Maecenas
you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to
ANTONY Thou art a soldier only Speak no more
ENOBARBUS That truth should be silent I had almost forgot
ANTONY You wrong this presence therefore speak no more
CAESAR I do not much dislike the matter but
We shall remain in friendship our conditions
What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge
AGRIPPA Give me leave Caesar
CAESAR Speak Agrippa
Is now a widower
CAESAR Say not so Agrippa
If Cleopatra heard you your reproof
ANTONY I am not married Caesar Let me hear
Agrippa further speak
AGRIPPA To hold you in perpetual amity
To make you brothers and to knit your hearts
With an unslipping knot take Antony
Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims
No worse a husband than the best of men
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
That which none else can utter By this marriage
All little jealousies which now seem great
And all great fears which now import their dangers
Would then be nothing Truths would be tales
Where now half tales be truths Her love to both
Would each to other and all loves to both
Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke
By duty ruminated
ANTONY Will Caesar speak
With what is spoke already
ANTONY What power is in Agrippa
To make this good
CAESAR The power of Caesar and
His power unto Octavia
ANTONY May I never
To this good purpose that so fairly shows
Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand
Further this act of grace and from this hour
The heart of brothers govern in our loves
And sway our great designs
CAESAR There is my hand
A sister I bequeath you whom no brother
Did ever love so dearly Let her live
To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never
Fly off our loves again
LEPIDUS Happily amen
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
Of late upon me I must thank him only
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report
At heel of that defy him
Of us must Pompey presently be sought
Or else he seeks out us
ANTONY Where lies he
CAESAR About the Mount Misenum
ANTONY What is his strength by land
CAESAR Great and increasing but by sea
He is an absolute master
ANTONY So is the fame
Would we had spoke together Haste we for it
Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we
CAESAR With most gladness
ANTONY Let us Lepidus
Not lack your company
LEPIDUS Noble Antony
Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS AGRIPPA MAECENAS
MAECENAS Welcome from Egypt sir
ENOBARBUS Half the heart of Caesar worthy Maecenas My honourable
friend Agrippa
AGRIPPA Good Enobarbus
MAECENAS We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
ENOBARBUS Ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made
the night light with drinking
MAECENAS Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but
twelve persons there Is this true
ENOBARBUS This was but as a fly by an eagle We had much more
monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
upon the river of Cydnus
her
ENOBARBUS I will tell you
Purple the sails and so perfumed that
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made
The water which they beat to follow faster
As amorous of their strokes For her own person
Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool
And what they undid did
AGRIPPA O rare for Antony
ENOBARBUS Her gentlewomen like the Nereides
And made their bends adornings At the helm
A seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle
That yarely frame the office From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast
Her people out upon her and Antony
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too
And made a gap in nature
AGRIPPA Rare Egyptian
ENOBARBUS Upon her landing Antony sent to her
Invited her to supper She replied
It should be better he became her guest
Which she entreated Our courteous Antony
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only
AGRIPPA Royal wench
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed
ENOBARBUS I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street
And having lost her breath she spoke and panted
That she did make defect perfection
MAECENAS Now Antony must leave her utterly
ENOBARBUS Never He will not
Age cannot wither her nor custom stale
Her infinite variety Other women cloy
The appetites they feed but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies for vilest things
Become themselves in her that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish
MAECENAS If beauty wisdom modesty can settle
The heart of Antony Octavia is
A blessed lottery to him
AGRIPPA Let us go
Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest
Whilst you abide here
ENOBARBUS Humbly sir I thank you                    Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter ANTONY CAESAR OCTAVIA between them
ANTONY The world and my great office will sometimes
Divide me from your bosom
OCTAVIA All which time
Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
To them for you
ANTONY Good night sir My Octavia
I have not kept my square but that to come
OCTAVIA Good night sir
CAESAR Good night                  Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA
Enter SOOTHSAYER
ANTONY Now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt
SOOTHSAYER Would I had never come from thence nor you thither
SOOTHSAYER I see it in my motion have it not in my tongue but
yet hie you to Egypt again
ANTONY Say to me
Therefore O Antony stay not by his side
Thy daemon that thy spirit which keeps thee is
Noble courageous high unmatchable
Make space enough between you
ANTONY Speak this no more
SOOTHSAYER To none but thee no more but when to thee
If thou dost play with him at any game
Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck
When he shines by I say again thy spirit
Is all afraid to govern thee near him
ANTONY Get thee gone
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him
Exit SOOTHSAYER
He hath spoken true The very dice obey him
And in our sports my better cunning faints
Under his chance If we draw lots he speeds
His cocks do win the battle still of mine
When it is all to nought and his quails ever
And though I make this marriage for my peace
Enter VENTIDIUS
O come Ventidius

ALL The music ho
Enter MARDIAN the eunuch
CHARMIAN My arm is sore best play with Mardian
MARDIAN As well as I can madam
My music playing far off I will betray
Their slimy jaws and as I draw them up
Did hang a salt fish on his hook which he
With fervency drew up
CLEOPATRA That time O times
I laughed him out of patience and that night
Ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed
Then put my tires and mantles on him whilst
I wore his sword Philippan
Enter a MESSENGER
O from Italy
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears
That long time have been barren
If thou so yield him there is gold and here
MESSENGER First madam he is well
But sirrah mark we use
To say the dead are well Bring it to that
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
MESSENGER Good madam hear me
CLEOPATRA Well go to I will
To trumpet such good tidings If not well
Not like a formal man
Yet if thou say Antony lives is well
Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him
Rich pearls upon thee
CLEOPATRA Well said
MESSENGER And friends with Caesar
MESSENGER Caesar and he are greater friends than ever
CLEOPATRA Make thee a fortune from me
Some monstrous malefactor Prithee friend
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear
MESSENGER Free madam No I made no such report
CLEOPATRA For what good turn
CLEOPATRA I am pale Charmian
CLEOPATRA The most infectious pestilence upon thee
MESSENGER Good madam patience
MESSENGER Gracious madam
I that do bring the news made not the match
And make thy fortunes proud The blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg
What mean you madam I have made no fault             Exit
CHARMIAN Good madam keep yourself within yourself
The man is innocent
CLEOPATRA Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt
Melt Egypt into Nile and kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents Call the slave again
Though I am mad I will not bite him Call
CLEOPATRA I will not hurt him
These hands do lack nobility that they strike
A meaner than myself since I myself
Have given myself the cause
Enter the MESSENGER again
Come hither sir
Though it be honest it is never good
To bring bad news Give to a gracious message
An host of tongues but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt
MESSENGER I have done my duty
CLEOPATRA Is he married
I cannot hate thee worser than I do
CLEOPATRA The gods confound thee Dost thou hold there still
MESSENGER Should I lie madam
CLEOPATRA O I would thou didst
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly He is married
CLEOPATRA He is married
MESSENGER Take no offence that I would not offend you
To punish me for what you make me do
CLEOPATRA O that his fault should make a knave of thee
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me Lie they upon thy hand
CHARMIAN Good your Highness patience
CHARMIAN Many times madam
Go to the fellow good Alexas bid him
Report the feature of Octavia her years
Her inclination let him not leave out

with soldiers marching
POMPEY Your hostages I have so have you mine
And we shall talk before we fight
CAESAR Most meet
That first we come to words and therefore have we
Our written purposes before us sent
Which if thou hast considered let us know
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
That else must perish here
POMPEY To you all three
The senators alone of this great world
Chief factors for the gods I do not know
Wherefore my father should revengers want
Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted
To drench the Capitol but that they would
Have one man but a man And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy at whose burden
Cast on my noble father
CAESAR Take your time
ANTONY Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails
POMPEY At land indeed
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself
The offers we have sent you
ANTONY Which do not be entreated to but weigh
CAESAR And what may follow
To try a larger fortune
POMPEY You have made me offer
Of Sicily Sardinia and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates then to send
Our targes undinted
POMPEY Know then
To take this offer but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience Though I lose
The praise of it by telling you must know
When Caesar and your brother were at blows
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly
ANTONY I have heard it Pompey
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you
POMPEY Let me have your hand
I did not think sir to have met you here
CAESAR Since I saw you last
There is a change upon you
POMPEY Well I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face
But in my bosom shall she never come
To make my heart her vassal
LEPIDUS Well met here
POMPEY I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed
I crave our composition may be written
Draw lots who shall begin
ANTONY That will I Pompey
POMPEY No Antony take the lot
But first or last your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there
ANTONY You have heard much
POMPEY I have fair meanings sir
ANTONY And fair words to them
POMPEY Then so much have I heard
ENOBARBUS No more of that He did so
POMPEY What I pray you
ENOBARBUS A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress
ENOBARBUS Well
And well am like to do for I perceive
Four feasts are toward
POMPEY Let me shake thy hand
I never hated thee I have seen thee fight
When I have envied thy behaviour
ENOBARBUS Sir
As I have said you did
POMPEY Enjoy thy plainness
It nothing ill becomes thee
Aboard my galley I invite you all
Will you lead lords
POMPEY Come               Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS
ENOBARBUS At sea I think
MENAS We have sir
ENOBARBUS You have done well by water
MENAS And you by land
ENOBARBUS I Will praise any man that will praise me though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land
MENAS Nor what I have done by water
ENOBARBUS Yes something you can deny for your own safety you
have been a great thief by sea
MENAS And you by land
ENOBARBUS There I deny my land service But give me your hand
Menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two
thieves kissing
ENOBARBUS But there is never a fair woman has a true face
MENAS No slander they steal hearts
ENOBARBUS We came hither to fight with you
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
you is he married to Cleopatra
MENAS True sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus
ENOBARBUS But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius
MENAS Pray ye sir
MENAS Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together
ENOBARBUS If I were bound to divine of this unity I would not
prophesy so
MENAS I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage
than the love of the parties
ENOBARBUS I think so too But you shall find the band that seems
to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of
their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
MENAS Who would not have his wife so
ENOBARBUS Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony He
will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia
blow the fire up in Caesar and as I said before that which is
the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of
their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he
married but his occasion here
MENAS And thus it may be Come sir will you aboard I have a
health for you

organs It lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements

LEPIDUS What colour is it of
ANTONY Of it own colour too
CAESAR Will this description satisfy him
ANTONY With the health that Pompey gives him else he is a very
epicure
Away
Rise from thy stool
MENAS I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes
Be jolly lords
ANTONY These quicksands Lepidus
Keep off them for you sink
MENAS Wilt thou be lord of all the world
POMPEY How should that be
MENAS But entertain it
And though you think me poor I am the man
Will give thee all the world
POMPEY Hast thou drunk well
MENAS No Pompey I have kept me from the cup
POMPEY Show me which way
Are in thy vessel Let me cut the cable
And when we are put off fall to their throats
All there is thine
POMPEY Ah this thou shouldst have done
I should have found it afterwards well done
But must condemn it now Desist and drink
Shall never find it more

MENAS Why
MENAS The third part then is drunk Would it were all
That it might go on wheels
ENOBARBUS Drink thou increase the reels
MENAS Come
POMPEY This is not yet an Alexandrian feast
ANTONY It ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho
And it grows fouler
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals
And celebrate our drink
In soft and delicate Lethe
ENOBARBUS All take hands
Make battery to our ears with the loud music
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley

Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne
Cup us till the world go round
Cup us till the world go round
CAESAR What would you more Pompey good night Good brother
Let me request you off our graver business
You see we have burnt our cheeks Strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks The wild disguise hath almost
Good Antony your hand

Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS

Put garlands on thy head
VENTIDIUS O Silius Silius
I have done enough A lower place note well
May make too great an act for learn this Silius
Better to leave undone than by our deed
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person Sossius

For quick accumulation of renown
Than gain which darkens him
I could do more to do Antonius good
Should my performance perish

ANTONY Gentle Octavia
Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
Best to preserve it If I lose mine honour
I lose myself better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless But as you requested
Shall stain your brother Make your soonest haste
So your desires are yours
OCTAVIA Thanks to my lord
The Jove of power make me most weak most weak
As if the world should cleave and that slain men
Should solder up the rift
ANTONY When it appears to you where this begins
Turn your displeasure that way for our faults
Can never be so equal that your love
Can equally move with them Provide your going

Which serve not for his vantage he shakes off
And so should you
Your mariners are muleteers reapers people
Their ships are yare yours heavy No disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea
ANTONY By sea by sea

The absolute soldiership you have by land
Distract your army which doth most consist
Your own renowned knowledge quite forgo
The way which promises assurance and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard
From firm security

What further comes

He sends so poor a pinion of his wing
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by
Enter EUPHRONIUS Ambassador from ANTONY
CAESAR Approach and speak
EUPHRONIUS Such as I am I come from Antony
I was of late as petty to his ends
To his grand sea
EUPHRONIUS Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and
Requires to live in Egypt which not granted
He lessens his requests and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth
A private man in Athens This for him
Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness
Submits her to thy might and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs
Now hazarded to thy grace
CAESAR For Antony
I have no ears to his request The Queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail so she
Or take his life there This if she perform
She shall not sue unheard So to them both
EUPHRONIUS Fortune pursue thee
CAESAR Bring him through the bands           Exit EUPHRONIUS
From Antony win Cleopatra Promise
And in our name what she requires add more
From thine invention offers Women are not
In their best fortunes strong but want will perjure
Make thine own edict for thy pains which we
Will answer as a law
THYREUS Caesar I go
CAESAR Observe how Antony becomes his flaw
In every power that moves
THYREUS Caesar I shall                               Exeunt

SCENE XIII
Enter CLEOPATRA ENOBARBUS CHARMIAN and IRAS
CLEOPATRA What shall we do Enobarbus
ENOBARBUS Think and die
CLEOPATRA Is Antony or we in fault for this
ENOBARBUS Antony only that would make his will
Lord of his reason What though you fled
From that great face of war whose several ranges
Frighted each other Why should he follow
The itch of his affection should not then
Than was his loss to course your flying flags
And leave his navy gazing
CLEOPATRA Prithee peace
Enter EUPHRONIUS the Ambassador with ANTONY
ANTONY Is that his answer
EUPHRONIUS Ay my lord
ANTONY The Queen shall then have courtesy so she
Will yield us up
EUPHRONIUS He says so
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities
CLEOPATRA That head my lord
ANTONY To him again Tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him from which the world should note
Something particular His coin ships legions
Under the service of a child as soon
To lay his gay comparisons apart
Exeunt ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
A parcel of their fortunes and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them
To suffer all alike That he should dream
Knowing all measures the full Caesar will
His judgment too
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT A messenger from Caesar
CLEOPATRA What no more ceremony See my women
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly Yet he that can endure
Does conquer him that did his master conquer
Enter THYREUS
THYREUS Hear it apart
CLEOPATRA None but friends say boldly
THYREUS So haply are they friends to Antony
ENOBARBUS He needs as many sir as Caesar has
Or needs not us If Caesar please our master
Will leap to be his friend For us you know
THYREUS So
Further than he is Caesar
CLEOPATRA Go on Right royal
THYREUS He knows that you embrace not Antony
CLEOPATRA O
THYREUS The scars upon your honour therefore he
Does pity as constrained blemishes
CLEOPATRA He is a god and knows
What is most right Mine honour was not yielded
I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky
That we must leave thee to thy sinking for
Thy dearest quit thee                                  Exit
THYREUS Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him For he partly begs
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon But it would warm his spirits
To hear from me you had left Antony
And put yourself under his shroud
The universal landlord
THYREUS My name is Thyreus
CLEOPATRA Most kind messenger
Say to great Caesar this in deputation
I kiss his conquring hand Tell him I am prompt
The doom of Egypt
Wisdom and fortune combating together
If that the former dare but what it can
No chance may shake it Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand
ANTONY Favours by Jove that thunders
What art thou fellow
THYREUS One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest
Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth
Antony yet
Enter servants
Take hence this Jack and whip him
Than with an old one dying
ANTONY Moon and stars
That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them
Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows
Till like a boy you see him cringe his face
And whine aloud for mercy Take him hence
ANTONY Tug him away Being whipt
Bear us an errand to him       Exeunt servants with THYREUS
You were half blasted ere I knew you Ha
Forborne the getting of a lawful race
By one that looks on feeders
ANTONY You have been a boggler ever
In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us
To our confusion
ANTONY I found you as a morsel cold upon
Though you can guess what temperance should be
You know not what it is
CLEOPATRA Wherefore is this
ANTONY To let a fellow that will take rewards
My playfellow your hand this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts O that I were
Upon the hill of Basan to outroar
The horned herd For I have savage cause
And to proclaim it civilly were like
For being yare about him
Is he whipt
SERVANT Soundly my lord
SERVANT He did ask favour
ANTONY If that thy father live let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph since
Thou hast been whipt for following him Henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee
Tell him thy entertainment look thou say
He makes me angry with him for he seems
Proud and disdainful harping on what I am
Not what he knew I was He makes me angry
When my good stars that were my former guides
Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires
My speech and what is done tell him he has
Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom
He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture
As he shall like to quit me Urge it thou
Hence with thy stripes be gone                Exit THYREUS
CLEOPATRA Have you done yet
ANTONY Alack our terrene moon
The fall of Antony
CLEOPATRA I must stay his time
ANTONY To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points
CLEOPATRA Not know me yet
CLEOPATRA Ah dear if I be so
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail
And poison it in the source and the first stone
Drop in my neck as it determines so
Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite
Till by degrees the memory of my womb
Together with my brave Egyptians all
By the discandying of this pelleted storm
Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey
ANTONY I am satisfied
Caesar sits down in Alexandria where
I will oppose his fate Our force by land
Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips I will appear in blood
I and my sword will earn our chronicle
And fight maliciously For when mine hours
Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives
And send to darkness all that stop me Come
All my sad captains fill our bowls once more
CLEOPATRA It is my birthday
Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra
ANTONY We will yet do well
CLEOPATRA Call all his noble captains to my lord
The wine peep through their scars Come on my queen
Even with his pestilent scythe     Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS
Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge and I see still
Restores his heart When valour preys on reason
It eats the sword it fights with I will seek
Some way to leave him                                  Exit

Haply you shall not see me more or if
As one that takes his leave Mine honest friends
I turn you not away but like a master
Married to your good service stay till death
ENOBARBUS What mean you sir
To give them this discomfort Look they weep

ANTONY Ho ho ho

My fleet hath yielded to the foe and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Hast sold me to this novice and my heart

EROS Ay noble lord
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion
A forked mountain or blue promontory
And mock our eyes with air Thou hast seen these signs
EROS Ay my lord
ANTONY That which is now a horse even with a thought
The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct
As water is in water
EROS It does my lord
ANTONY My good knave Eros now thy captain is
Even such a body Here I am Antony
Yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave
Whose heart I thought I had for she had mine
Nay weep not gentle Eros there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves
Enter MARDIAN
O thy vile lady
MARDIAN No Antony
With thine entirely
ANTONY Hence saucy eunuch peace

Is done unto thy hand The last she spake

The name of Antony it was divided
Thy name so buried in her
ANTONY Dead then
MARDIAN Dead
Does pay thy labour richly Go                 Exit MARDIAN
Off pluck off
The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart O cleave my sides
Heart once be stronger than thy continent
No more a soldier Bruised pieces go
Weep for my pardon So it must be for now
All length is torture Since the torch is out
Lie down and stray no farther Now all labour
Mars what it does yea very force entangles
Itself with strength Seal then and all is done
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops
EROS What would my lord
ANTONY Since Cleopatra died
Detest my baseness I that with my sword
With ships made cities condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
Disgrace and horror that on my command
Put colour in thy cheek
EROS The gods withhold me
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts
Though enemy lost aim and could not
ANTONY Eros
Of fortunate Caesar drawn before him branded
His baseness that ensued
Draw that thy honest sword which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country
EROS O sir pardon me
To do this when I bade thee Do it at once
Or thy precedent services are all
EROS Turn from me then that noble countenance
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies
EROS My sword is drawn
ANTONY Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it
EROS My dear master
My captain and my emperor let me say
Before I strike this bloody stroke farewell
EROS Farewell great chief Shall I strike now
ANTONY Now Eros
EROS Why there then Thus do I escape the sorrow
ANTONY Thrice nobler than myself
Thou teachest me O valiant Eros what
I should and thou couldst not My queen and Eros
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
A nobleness in record But I will be
Thy master dies thy scholar To do thus
The guard ho O dispatch me

My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee
ANTONY When did she send thee
DIOMEDES Now my lord

But fearing since how it might work hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth and I am come
I dread too late
ANTONY Too late good Diomed Call my guard I prithee
Come your lord calls
Enter four or five of the guard of ANTONY
ANTONY Bear me good friends where Cleopatra bides
FIRST GUARD Woe woe are we sir you may not live to wear
All your true followers out

Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft with CHARMIAN
and IRAS
CLEOPATRA O Charmian I will never go from hence
CHARMIAN Be comforted dear madam
CLEOPATRA No I will not
All strange and terrible events are welcome
But comforts we despise our size of sorrow
As that which makes it
Enter DIOMEDES below
How now Is he dead
His guard have brought him thither
Enter below ANTONY borne by the guard
CLEOPATRA O sun
Antony Antony Help Charmian help Iras help
ANTONY Peace
CLEOPATRA So it should be that none but Antony
ANTONY I am dying Egypt dying only
I here importune death awhile until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay upon thy lips
CLEOPATRA I dare not dear
Dear my lord pardon I dare not
Edge sting or operation I am safe
Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes
And still conclusion shall acquire no honour
Assist good friends
ANTONY O quick or I am gone
Our strength is all gone into heaviness
Wishers were ever fools O come come
Quicken with kissing Had my lips that power
Thus would I wear them out
ALL A heavy sight
ANTONY I am dying Egypt dying
Give me some wine and let me speak a little
CLEOPATRA No let me speak and let me rail so high
That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel
ANTONY One word sweet queen
Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety O
CLEOPATRA They do not go together
ANTONY Gentle hear me
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius
None about Caesar
ANTONY The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
The noblest and do now not basely die
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
I can no more
Hast thou no care of me Shall I abide
In this dull world which in thy absence is
Are level now with men The odds is gone
And there is nothing left remarkable
CHARMIAN O quietness lady
CHARMIAN Lady
IRAS Madam
CHARMIAN O madam madam madam
IRAS Royal Egypt Empress
CHARMIAN Peace peace Iras
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Patience is sottish and impatience does
To rush into the secret house of death
Ere death dare come to us How do you women
What what good cheer Why how now Charmian
My noble girls Ah women women look
And make death proud to take us Come away
This case of that huge spirit now is cold
Ah women women Come we have no friend
But resolution and the briefest end

DOLABELLA Caesar I shall                               Exit
Enter DERCETAS With the sword of ANTONY
Appear thus to us
He was my master and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters If thou please
To take me to thee as I was to him
I yield thee up my life
DERCETAS I say O Caesar Antony is dead
CAESAR The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack The round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets
And citizens to their dens The death of Antony
Is not a single doom in the name lay
A moiety of the world
DERCETAS He is dead Caesar
Not by a public minister of justice
Nor by a hired knife but that self hand
Which writ his honour in the acts it did
Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it
Splitted the heart This is his sword
With his most noble blood
CAESAR Look you sad friends
The gods rebuke me but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings
AGRIPPA And strange it is
That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds
MAECENAS His taints and honours
AGRIPPA A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity But you gods will give us
He needs must see himself
CAESAR O Antony
Diseases in our bodies I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day
Or look on thine we could not stall together
In the whole world But yet let me lament
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts
That thou my brother my competitor
In top of all design my mate in empire
Friend and companion in the front of war
The arm of mine own body and the heart
Unreconciliable should divide
Enter an EGYPTIAN
But I will tell you at some meeter season
The business of this man looks out of him
EGYPTIAN A poor Egyptian yet the Queen my mistress
Of thy intents desires instruction
That she preparedly may frame herself
CAESAR Bid her have good heart
She soon shall know of us by some of ours
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her for Caesar cannot learn
To be ungentle
EGYPTIAN So the gods preserve thee                      Exit
CAESAR Come hither Proculeius Go and say
We purpose her no shame Give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require
Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph Go
And with your speediest bring us what she says

PROCULEIUS Caesar I shall                              Exit
CAESAR Gallus go you along                      Exit GALLUS
ALL Dolabella
CAESAR Let him alone for I remember now
Go with me to my tent where you shall see
How hardly I was drawn into this war
How calm and gentle I proceeded still
In all my writings Go with me and see
What I can show in this                              Exeunt
ACT_5|SC_2
SCENE II
Alexandria The monument
Enter CLEOPATRA CHARMIAN IRAS and MARDIAN
CLEOPATRA My desolation does begin to make
A minister of her will and it is great
To do that thing that ends all other deeds
Which shackles accidents and bolts up change
Which sleeps and never palates more the dug
Enter to the gates of the monument PROCULEIUS GALLUS
and soldiers
PROCULEIUS Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt
And bids thee study on what fair demands
PROCULEIUS My name is Proculeius
CLEOPATRA Antony
Did tell me of you bade me trust you but
That have no use for trusting If your master
Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him
That majesty to keep decorum must
No less beg than a kingdom If he please
He gives me so much of mine own as I
Will kneel to him with thanks
PROCULEIUS Be of good cheer
Make your full reference freely to my lord
Who is so full of grace that it flows over
On all that need Let me report to him
Your sweet dependency and you shall find
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
CLEOPATRA Pray you tell him
The greatness he has got I hourly learn
A doctrine of obedience and would gladly
Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied
Here PROCULEIUS and two of the guard ascend the
monument by a ladder placed against a window
and come behind CLEOPATRA Some of the guard
unbar and open the gates
Guard her till Caesar come                             Exit
IRAS Royal Queen
CHARMIAN O Cleopatra thou art taken Queen
Do not yourself such wrong who are in this
CLEOPATRA What of death too
That rids our dogs of languish
PROCULEIUS Cleopatra
His nobleness well acted which your death
Will never let come forth
CLEOPATRA Where art thou death
Come hither come Come come and take a queen
Worth many babes and beggars
PROCULEIUS O temperance lady
If idle talk will once be necessary
Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I
Of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up
And show me to the shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt
Blow me into abhorring Rather make
And hang me up in chains
PROCULEIUS You do extend
These thoughts of horror further than you shall
Find cause in Caesar
Enter DOLABELLA
DOLABELLA Proculeius
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows
And he hath sent for thee For the Queen
PROCULEIUS So Dolabella
It shall content me best Be gentle to her
CLEOPATRA Say I would die
Exeunt PROCULEIUS and soldiers
DOLABELLA Most noble Empress you have heard of me
CLEOPATRA I cannot tell
DOLABELLA Assuredly you know me
CLEOPATRA No matter sir what I have heard or known
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams
DOLABELLA I understand not madam
O such another sleep that I might see
But such another man
A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted
The little O the earth
Crested the world His voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres and that to friends
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb
He was as rattling thunder For his bounty
That grew the more by reaping His delights
CLEOPATRA Think you there was or might be such a man
As this I dreamt of
DOLABELLA Gentle madam no
CLEOPATRA You lie up to the hearing of the gods
But if there be nor ever were one such
Condemning shadows quite
DOLABELLA Hear me good madam
Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it
As answering to the weight Would I might never
By the rebound of yours a grief that smites
My very heart at root
CLEOPATRA I thank you sir
Know you what Caesar means to do with me
DOLABELLA I am loath to tell you what I would you knew
CLEOPATRA Nay pray you sir
Enter CAESAR GALLUS PROCULEIUS MAECENAS SELEUCUS
and others of his train
CAESAR Which is the Queen of Egypt
CAESAR Arise you shall not kneel
I pray you rise rise Egypt
CLEOPATRA Sir the gods
Will have it thus my master and my lord
I must obey
CAESAR Take to you no hard thoughts
The record of what injuries you did us
Though written in our flesh we shall remember
As things but done by chance
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
CAESAR Cleopatra know
We will extenuate rather than enforce
A benefit in this change but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty by taking
Of my good purposes and put your children
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall
Hang in what place you please Here my good lord
CAESAR You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra
CLEOPATRA This is the brief of money plate and jewels
SELEUCUS Here madam
CLEOPATRA This is my treasurer let him speak my lord
To myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus
SELEUCUS Madam
I had rather seal my lips than to my peril
Speak that which is not
CLEOPATRA What have I kept back
SELEUCUS Enough to purchase what you have made known
CAESAR Nay blush not Cleopatra I approve
Your wisdom in the deed
CLEOPATRA See Caesar O behold
How pomp is followed Mine will now be yours
And should we shift estates yours would be mine
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild O slave of no more trust
Though they had wings Slave soulless villain dog
O rarely base
CAESAR Good Queen let us entreat you
CLEOPATRA O Caesar what a wounding shame is this
That thou vouchsafing here to visit me
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy Say good Caesar
Immoment toys things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal and say
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia to induce
With one that I have bred The gods It smites me
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Thou wouldst have mercy on me
CAESAR Forbear Seleucus                       Exit SELEUCUS
CLEOPATRA Be it known that we the greatest are misthought
For things that others do and when we fall
Are therefore to be pitied
CAESAR Cleopatra
Bestow it at your pleasure and believe
Make not your thoughts your prisons No dear Queen
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel Feed and sleep
Our care and pity is so much upon you
That we remain your friend and so adieu
CLEOPATRA My master and my lord
CAESAR Not so Adieu
Flourish Exeunt CAESAR and his train
CLEOPATRA He words me girls he words me that I should not
Be noble to myself But hark thee Charmian
IRAS Finish good lady the bright day is done
And we are for the dark
CLEOPATRA Hie thee again
I have spoke already and it is provided
Go put it to the haste
CHARMIAN Madam I will
CHARMIAN Behold sir                                    Exit
CLEOPATRA Dolabella
DOLABELLA Madam as thereto sworn by your command
Which my love makes religion to obey
I tell you this Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey and within three days
You with your children will he send before
Your pleasure and my promise
CLEOPATRA Dolabella
I shall remain your debtor
DOLABELLA I your servant
Adieu good Queen I must attend on Caesar
CLEOPATRA Farewell and thanks                Exit DOLABELLA
Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown
In Rome as well as I Mechanic slaves
With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall
Uplift us to the view in their thick breaths
Rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded
IRAS The gods forbid
Will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers
Extemporally will stage us and present
Our Alexandrian revels Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
IRAS O the good gods
Are stronger than mine eyes
To fool their preparation and to conquer
Their most absurd intents
Enter CHARMIAN
Now Charmian
Show me my women like a queen Go fetch
My best attires I am again for Cydnus
To meet Mark Antony Sirrah Iras go
To play till doomsday Bring our crown and all
Exit IRAS A noise within
Enter a GUARDSMAN
GUARDSMAN Here is a rural fellow
He brings you figs
CLEOPATRA Let him come in                     Exit GUARDSMAN
What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed He brings me liberty
Of woman in me Now from head to foot
No planet is of mine
GUARDSMAN This is the man
CLEOPATRA Avoid and leave him                Exit GUARDSMAN
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there
That kills and pains not
CLOWN Truly I have him But I would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover
CLOWN Very many men and women too I heard of one of them no
longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given
to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how
they say shall never be saved by half that they do But this is
CLEOPATRA Get thee hence farewell
CLOWN I wish you all joy of the worm
CLEOPATRA Farewell
CLOWN You must think this look you that the worm will do his
kind
CLEOPATRA Ay ay farewell
CLOWN Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping
of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
CLEOPATRA Take thou no care it shall be heeded
CLOWN Very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is not worth
the feeding
CLEOPATRA Will it eat me
CLOWN You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil
himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for
the gods if the devil dress her not But truly these same
whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in
every ten that they make the devils mar five
CLEOPATRA Well get thee gone farewell
CLEOPATRA Give me my robe put on my crown I have
Immortal longings in me Now no more
Yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear
Antony call I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath Husband I come
Now to that name my courage prove my title
I am fire and air my other elements
I give to baser life So have you done
Come then and take the last warmth of my lips
Farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell
Have I the aspic in my lips Dost fall
If thus thou and nature can so gently part
CHARMIAN Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say
The gods themselves do weep
CLEOPATRA This proves me base
If she first meet the curled Antony
Which is my heaven to have Come thou mortal wretch
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie Poor venomous fool
Be angry and dispatch O couldst thou speak
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied
CHARMIAN O Eastern star
CLEOPATRA Peace peace
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
That sucks the nurse asleep
CHARMIAN O break O break
O Antony Nay I will take thee too
CHARMIAN In this vile world So fare thee well
Now boast thee death in thy possession lies
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Enter the guard rushing in
CHARMIAN Speak softly wake her not
O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee
FIRST GUARD What work is here Charmian is this well done
CHARMIAN It is well done and fitting for a princes
Descended of so many royal kings
DOLABELLA How goes it here
SECOND GUARD All dead
DOLABELLA Caesar thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this Thyself art coming
DOLABELLA O sir you are too sure an augurer
That you did fear is done
CAESAR Bravest at the last
Took her own way The manner of their deaths
I do not see them bleed
DOLABELLA Who was last with them
FIRST GUARD A simple countryman that brought her figs
This was his basket
FIRST GUARD O Caesar
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress Tremblingly she stood
CAESAR O noble weakness
By external swelling but she looks like sleep
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace
DOLABELLA Here on her breast
There is a vent of blood and something blown
The like is on her arm
Upon the caves of Nile
CAESAR Most probable
That so she died for her physician tells me
Of easy ways to die Take up her bed
And bear her women from the monument
She shall be buried by her Antony
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous High events as these
Strike those that make them and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral
And then to Rome Come Dolabella see
High order in this great solemnity                   Exeunt

SCENE
ACT I SCENE I
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
ORLANDO As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed
charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there
begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me
rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at
home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are
bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding
they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly
the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him
as I Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the
something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from
me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my
education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of
my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against
this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no
wise remedy how to avoid it
Enter OLIVER
ADAM Yonder comes my master your brother
ORLANDO Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me
OLIVER Now sir what make you here
ORLANDO Nothing I am not taught to make any thing
OLIVER What mar you then sir
ORLANDO Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a
poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
OLIVER Marry sir be better employed and be nought awhile
ORLANDO Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What
prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury
OLIVER Know you where you are sir
ORLANDO O sir very well here in your orchard
OLIVER Know you before whom sir
ORLANDO Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are
my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you
should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better
away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as
much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming
before me is nearer to his reverence
ORLANDO Come come elder brother you are too young in this
OLIVER Wilt thou lay hands on me villain
ORLANDO I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
Boys He was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such
a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not
remembrance be at accord
OLIVER Let me go I say
ORLANDO I will not till I please you shall hear me My father
me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow me such
exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor
allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy
my fortunes
OLIVER And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir
get you in I will not long be troubled with you you shall have
some part of your will I pray you leave me
ORLANDO I no further offend you than becomes me for my good
OLIVER Get you with him you old dog
your service God be with my old master He would not have spoke
such a word
Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
OLIVER Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic
your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla
Dennis
Enter DENNIS
DENNIS Calls your worship
DENNIS So please you he is here at the door and importunes access
to you
Enter CHARLES
CHARLES Good morrow to your worship
court
is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke
and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary
exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke
therefore he gives them good leave to wander
with her father
being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have
followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at
the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own
daughter and never two ladies loved as they do
OLIVER Where will the old Duke live
CHARLES They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many
merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood
of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day
and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world
CHARLES Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger
that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would
be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come
in therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint
you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment
or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is
thing of his own search and altogether against my will
OLIVER Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt
find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my
Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of
and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his
dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace
himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap
thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he
assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one
so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly
of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush
and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
CHARLES I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
Exit
OLIVER Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I
hope I shall see an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly
beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and
especially of my own people who best know him that I am
altogether misprised But it shall not be so long this wrestler
shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy

SCENE II
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
CELIA I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry
ROSALIND Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and
would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget
a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any
extraordinary pleasure
love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy
uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I
could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst
as mine is to thee
ROSALIND Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
rejoice in yours
CELIA You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to
have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what
he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee
again in affection By mine honour I will and when I break that
oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet Rose my dear
Rose be merry
ROSALIND From henceforth I will coz and devise sports
Let me see what think you of falling in love
CELIA Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man
in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety
of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again
ROSALIND What shall be our sport then
CELIA Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her
wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
ROSALIND I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily
misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
gifts to women
honest and those that she makes honest she makes very
Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of
Nature
Enter TOUCHSTONE
CELIA No when Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by
Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to
flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off
the argument
ROSALIND Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for
always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits How
now wit Whither wander you
TOUCHSTONE Mistress you must come away to your father
CELIA Were you made the messenger
TOUCHSTONE No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you
ROSALIND Where learned you that oath fool
TOUCHSTONE Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught
was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
CELIA How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
ROSALIND Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
TOUCHSTONE Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear
by your beards that I am a knave
CELIA By our beards if we had them thou art
TOUCHSTONE By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you
swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this
knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he
had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
that mustard
TOUCHSTONE One that old Frederick your father loves
TOUCHSTONE The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
men do foolishly
CELIA By my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that
fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have
makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le Beau
Enter LE BEAU
ROSALIND With his mouth full of news
CELIA Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
CELIA All the better we shall be the more marketable Bon jour
LE BEAU Fair Princess you have lost much good sport
CELIA Sport of what colour
LE BEAU What colour madam How shall I answer you
ROSALIND As wit and fortune will
TOUCHSTONE Or as the Destinies decrees
CELIA Well said that was laid on with a trowel
ROSALIND Thou losest thy old smell
LE BEAU You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good
wrestling which you have lost the sight of
ROSALIND Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling
LE BEAU I will tell you the beginning and if it please your
ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and
here where you are they are coming to perform it
CELIA Well the beginning that is dead and buried
CELIA I could match this beginning with an old tale
LE BEAU Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of
the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man
their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the
beholders take his part with weeping
ROSALIND Alas
TOUCHSTONE But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have
lost
LE BEAU Why this that I speak of
TOUCHSTONE Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time
that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies
CELIA Or I I promise thee
ROSALIND But is there any else longs to see this broken music in
see this wrestling cousin
LE BEAU You must if you stay here for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it
CELIA Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it
Flourish Enter DUKE FREDERICK LORDS ORLANDO
CHARLES and ATTENDANTS
FREDERICK Come on since the youth will not be entreated his own
peril on his forwardness
ROSALIND Is yonder the man
LE BEAU Even he madam
CELIA Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
FREDERICK How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to
see the wrestling
ROSALIND Ay my liege so please you give us leave
FREDERICK You will take little delight in it I can tell you
I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to
him ladies see if you can move him
CELIA Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau
LE BEAU Monsieur the Challenger the Princess calls for you
ORLANDO I attend them with all respect and duty
ORLANDO No fair Princess he is the general challenger I come
but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
CELIA Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the
fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own
safety and give over this attempt
ROSALIND Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be
misprised we will make it our suit to the Duke that the
wrestling might not go forward
ORLANDO I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts
wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
ladies any thing But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none
to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only
in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when
I have made it empty
ROSALIND The little strength that I have I would it were with
you
CELIA And mine to eke out hers
CHARLES Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to
lie with his mother earth
ORLANDO Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
FREDERICK You shall try but one fall
CHARLES No I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a
second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
before but come your ways
ROSALIND Now Hercules be thy speed young man
CELIA I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the
ROSALIND O excellent young man
CELIA If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should
down
FREDERICK No more no more
FREDERICK How dost thou Charles
LE BEAU He cannot speak my lord
FREDERICK Bear him away What is thy name young man
ORLANDO Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de
Boys
FREDERICK I would thou hadst been son to some man else
But I did find him still mine enemy
Hadst thou descended from another house
But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
I would thou hadst told me of another father
Exeunt DUKE train and LE BEAU
CELIA Were I my father coz would I do this
To be adopted heir to Frederick
Had I before known this young man his son
I should have given him tears unto entreaties
CELIA Gentle cousin
Let us go thank him and encourage him
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly as you have exceeded all promise
Your mistress shall be happy
Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
That could give more but that her hand lacks means
Shall we go coz
CELIA Ay Fare you well fair gentleman
Are all thrown down and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block
ROSALIND He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes
Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies
CELIA Will you go coz
ROSALIND Have with you Fare you well
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
ORLANDO What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue
O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee
LE BEAU Good sir I do in friendship counsel you
High commendation true applause and love
That he misconstrues all that you have done
The Duke is humorous what he is indeed
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of
ORLANDO I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
Which of the two was daughter of the Duke
That here was at the wrestling
LE BEAU Neither his daughter if we judge by manners
But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter
To keep his daughter company whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
But I can tell you that of late this Duke
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
Hereafter in a better world than this
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you
ORLANDO I rest much bounden to you fare you well
Exit LE BEAU
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother
From tyrant Duke unto a tyrant brother
But heavenly Rosalind                                  Exit
SCENE III
Enter CELIA and ROSALIND
CELIA Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy
Not a word
ROSALIND Not one to throw at a dog
CELIA No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs
throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons
ROSALIND Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should
CELIA But is all this for your father
CELIA They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday
foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats
will catch them
ROSALIND I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my
heart
CELIA Hem them away
CELIA Come come wrestle with thy affections
ROSALIND O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
CELIA O a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of
a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in
good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall
CELIA Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his
father dearly yet I hate not Orlando
ROSALIND No faith hate him not for my sake
CELIA Why should I not Doth he not deserve well
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with LORDS
ROSALIND Let me love him for that and do you love him because I
do Look here comes the Duke
CELIA With his eyes full of anger
FREDERICK Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court
ROSALIND Me uncle
FREDERICK You cousin
Within these ten days if that thou beest found
So near our public court as twenty miles
Thou diest for it
ROSALIND I do beseech your Grace
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your Highness
FREDERICK Thus do all traitors
If their purgation did consist in words
They are as innocent as grace itself
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not
ROSALIND Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends
ROSALIND SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom
Treason is not inherited my lord
Or if we did derive it from our friends
Then good my liege mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous
CELIA Dear sovereign hear me speak
CELIA I did not then entreat to have her stay
It was your pleasure and your own remorse
I was too young that time to value her
But now I know her If she be a traitor
Why so am I we still have slept together
Still we went coupled and inseparable
FREDERICK She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people and they pity her
Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone Then open not thy lips
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
CELIA Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
I cannot live out of her company
FREDERICK You are a fool You niece provide yourself
If you outstay the time upon mine honour
And in the greatness of my word you die
Exeunt DUKE and LORDS
CELIA O my poor Rosalind Whither wilt thou go
Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine
ROSALIND I have more cause
CELIA Thou hast not cousin
ROSALIND That he hath not
CELIA No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
No let my father seek another heir
Therefore devise with me how we may fly
Whither to go and what to bear with us
And do not seek to take your charge upon you
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
ROSALIND Why whither shall we go
CELIA To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden
ROSALIND Alas what danger will it be to us
Maids as we are to travel forth so far
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
And with a kind of umber smirch my face
The like do you so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants
ROSALIND Were it not better
Because that I am more than common tall
That I did suit me all points like a man
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances
CELIA What shall I call thee when thou art a man
And therefore look you call me Ganymede
CELIA Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia but Aliena
Would he not be a comfort to our travel
And get our jewels and our wealth together
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment                    Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
The Forest of Arden
Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three LORDS like foresters
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court
Here feel we not the penalty of Adam
Which when it bites and blows upon my body
Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
Sweet are the uses of adversity
Which like the toad ugly and venomous
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
Sermons in stones and good in everything
I would not change it
AMIENS Happy is your Grace
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style
DUKE SENIOR Come shall we go and kill us venison
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
Being native burghers of this desert city
Should in their own confines with forked heads
FIRST LORD Indeed my lord
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that
And in that kind swears you do more usurp
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood
Did come to languish and indeed my lord
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting and the big round tears
In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
Augmenting it with tears
DUKE SENIOR But what said Jaques
Did he not moralize this spectacle
FIRST LORD O yes into a thousand similes
First for his weeping into the needless stream
As worldlings do giving thy sum of more
Left and abandoned of his velvet friends
Full of the pasture jumps along by him
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country city court
Yea and of this our life swearing that we
To fright the animals and to kill them up
DUKE SENIOR And did you leave him in this contemplation
SECOND LORD We did my lord weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer
DUKE SENIOR Show me the place
I love to cope him in these sullen fits
SCENE II
Enter DUKE FREDERICK with LORDS
FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them
It cannot be some villains of my court
Are of consent and sufferance in this
FIRST LORD I cannot hear of any that did see her
The ladies her attendants of her chamber
Saw her abed and in the morning early
SECOND LORD My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing
Your daughter and her cousin much commend
The parts and graces of the wrestler
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
And she believes wherever they are gone
That youth is surely in their company
FREDERICK Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
If he be absent bring his brother to me
And let not search and inquisition quail
To bring again these foolish runaways                Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting
ADAM What my young master O my gentle master
O my sweet master O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland Why what make you here
Why are you virtuous Why do people love you
And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
Know you not master to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies
No more do yours Your virtues gentle master
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
O what a world is this when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it
ADAM O unhappy youth
Come not within these doors within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives
Yet not the son I will not call him son
Hath heard your praises and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it If he fail of that
He will have other means to cut you off
I overheard him and his practices
This is no place this house is but a butchery
Abhor it fear it do not enter it
ORLANDO Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go
ADAM No matter whither so you come not here
ORLANDO What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food
A thievish living on the common road
This I must do or know not what to do
Yet this I will not do do how I can
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother
ADAM But do not so I have five hundred crowns
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown
Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
Yea providently caters for the sparrow
Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
All this I give you Let me be your servant
Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
Frosty but kindly Let me go with you
In all your business and necessities
ORLANDO O good old man how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world
When service sweat for duty not for meed
Thou art not for the fashion of these times
Where none will sweat but for promotion
And having that do choke their service up
Even with the having it is not so with thee
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
ADAM Master go on and I will follow the
To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
Here lived I but now live here no more
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
But at fourscore it is too late a week
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
SCENE IV
The Forest of Arden
Enter ROSALIND for GANYMEDE CELIA for ALIENA and CLOWN alias TOUCHSTONE
ROSALIND O Jupiter how weary are my spirits
TOUCHSTONE I Care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary
and to cry like a woman but I must comfort the weaker vessel as
doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat
therefore courage good Aliena
CELIA I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further
TOUCHSTONE For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you
yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you for I think you
have no money in your purse
ROSALIND Well this is the Forest of Arden
TOUCHSTONE Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was at
home I was in a better place but travellers must be content
Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
ROSALIND Ay be so good Touchstone Look you who comes here a
young man and an old in solemn talk
CORIN That is the way to make her scorn you still
SILVIUS No Corin being old thou canst not guess
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
But if thy love were ever like to mine
As sure I think did never man love so
How many actions most ridiculous
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
CORIN Into a thousand that I have forgotten
SILVIUS O thou didst then never love so heartily
That ever love did make thee run into
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
Or if thou hast not broke from company
Abruptly as my passion now makes me
O Phebe Phebe Phebe                          Exit Silvius
ROSALIND Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
I have by hard adventure found mine own
TOUCHSTONE And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my
Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her batler and the
the wooing of  peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods
but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal
in folly
my shins against it
Is much upon my fashion
TOUCHSTONE And mine but it grows something stale with me
CELIA I pray you one of you question yond man
If he for gold will give us any food
I faint almost to death
TOUCHSTONE Holla you clown
CORIN Who calls
TOUCHSTONE Your betters sir
CORIN Else are they very wretched
ROSALIND Peace I say Good even to you friend
CORIN And to you gentle sir and to you all
ROSALIND I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
Can in this desert place buy entertainment
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
And faints for succour
CORIN Fair sir I pity her
And wish for her sake more than for mine own
My fortunes were more able to relieve her
But I am shepherd to another man
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
My master is of churlish disposition
And little recks to find the way to heaven
By doing deeds of hospitality
Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
By reason of his absence there is nothing
That you will feed on but what is come see
And in my voice most welcome shall you be
ROSALIND What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture
CORIN That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
That little cares for buying any thing
ROSALIND I pray thee if it stand with honesty
Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us
CELIA And we will mend thy wages I like this place
And willingly could waste my time in it
CORIN Assuredly the thing is to be sold
Go with me if you like upon report
The soil the profit and this kind of life
I will your very faithful feeder be
And buy it with your gold right suddenly             Exeunt
SCENE V
Another part of the forest
Enter AMIENS JAQUES and OTHERS
SONG
AMIENS    Under the greenwood tree
Who loves to lie with me
And turn his merry note
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather
JAQUES More more I prithee more
AMIENS It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques
JAQUES I thank it More I prithee more I can suck melancholy
out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs More I prithee more
AMIENS My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you
JAQUES I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to sing
AMIENS What you will Monsieur Jaques
JAQUES Nay I care not for their names they owe me nothing Will
you sing
AMIENS More at your request than to please myself
and when a man thanks me heartily methinks have given him a
penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks Come sing and you
that will not hold your tongues
will drink under this tree He hath been all this day to look
you
JAQUES And I have been all this day to avoid him He is to
disputable for my company I think of as many matters as he but
I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them Come warble
come
SONG
Who doth ambition shun
Seeking the food he eats
Come hither come hither come hither
Here shall he see
No enemy
But winter and rough weather
despite of my invention
JAQUES Thus it goes
If it do come to pass
That any man turn ass
Leaving his wealth and ease
A stubborn will to please
Ducdame ducdame ducdame
Here shall he see
Gross fools as he
An if he will come to me
Exeunt severally
SCENE VI
The forest
Enter ORLANDO and ADAM
ADAM Dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie
I down and measure out my grave Farewell kind master
ORLANDO Why how now Adam No greater heart in thee Live a
little comfort a little cheer thyself a little If this uncouth
forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or
bring it for food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy
powers For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the
not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou
diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said
liest in the bleak air Come I will bear thee to some shelter
and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live
anything in this desert Cheerly good Adam          Exeunt
SCENE VII
The forest
A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and LORDS like outlaws
For I can nowhere find him like a man
FIRST LORD My lord he is but even now gone hence
Here was he merry hearing of a song
DUKE SENIOR If he compact of jars grow musical
We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
Go seek him tell him I would speak with him
Enter JAQUES
FIRST LORD He saves my labour by his own approach
DUKE SENIOR Why how now monsieur what a life is this
That your poor friends must woo your company
What you look merrily
A motley fool A miserable world
As I do live by food I met a fool
And then he drew a dial from his poke
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
The motley fool thus moral on the time
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
That fools should be so deep contemplative
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial O noble fool
DUKE SENIOR What fool is this
JAQUES O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
And says if ladies be but young and fair
They have the gift to know it and in his brain
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
With observation the which he vents
In mangled forms O that I were a fool
I am ambitious for a motley coat
DUKE SENIOR Thou shalt have one
JAQUES It is my only suit
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise I must have liberty
Withal as large a charter as the wind
To blow on whom I please for so fools have
And they that are most galled with my folly
They most must laugh And why sir must they so
The why is plain as way to parish church
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly although he smart
Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
Invest me in my motley give me leave
To speak my mind and I will through and through
If they will patiently receive my medicine
DUKE SENIOR Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do
JAQUES What for a counter would I do but good
DUKE SENIOR Most Mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
For thou thyself hast been a libertine
As sensual as the brutish sting itself
That thou with license of free foot hast caught
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
JAQUES Why who cries out on pride
That can therein tax any private party
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
What woman in the city do I name
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
Who can come in and say that I mean her
When such a one as she such is her neighbour
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not on my cost
Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech
There then how then what then Let me see wherein
Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn
ORLANDO Forbear and eat no more
JAQUES Why I have eat none yet
JAQUES Of what kind should this cock come of
Or else a rude despiser of good manners
Of smooth civility yet arn I inland bred
And know some nurture But forbear I say
He dies that touches any of this fruit
Till I and my affairs are answered
DUKE SENIOR What would you have Your gentleness shall force
More than your force move us to gentleness
ORLANDO I almost die for food and let me have it
DUKE SENIOR Sit down and feed and welcome to our table
ORLANDO Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you
I thought that all things had been savage here
And therefore put I on the countenance
That in this desert inaccessible
Under the shade of melancholy boughs
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
In the which hope I blush and hide my sword
DUKE SENIOR True is it that we have seen better days
And therefore sit you down in gentleness
And take upon command what help we have
ORLANDO Then but forbear your food a little while
Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
And give it food There is an old poor man
Who after me hath many a weary step
I will not touch a bit
DUKE SENIOR Go find him out
And we will nothing waste till you return
ORLANDO I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort
Exit
DUKE SENIOR Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
This wide and universal theatre
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
Wherein we play in
And all the men and women merely players
They have their exits and their entrances
And one man in his time plays many parts
His acts being seven ages At first the infant
And shining morning face creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school And then the lover
Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
Seeking the bubble reputation
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
Full of wise saws and modern instances
And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
Turning again toward childish treble pipes
And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
That ends this strange eventful history
Is second childishness and mere oblivion
Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing
DUKE SENIOR Welcome Set down your venerable burden
And let him feed
ORLANDO I thank you most for him
ADAM So had you need
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself
DUKE SENIOR Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
As yet to question you about your fortunes
Give us some music and good cousin sing
SONG
Blow blow thou winter wind
Thou art not so unkind
Thy tooth is not so keen
Because thou art not seen
Although thy breath be rude
Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
This life is most jolly
Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
That dost not bite so nigh
As benefits forgot
Though thou the waters warp
Thy sting is not so sharp
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
Be truly welcome hither I am the Duke
Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
Thou art right welcome as thy master is
Support him by the arm Give me your hand
And let me all your fortunes understand              Exeunt
ACT III SCENE I
The palace
Enter DUKE FREDERICK OLIVER and LORDS
FREDERICK Not see him since Sir sir that cannot be
But were I not the better part made mercy
I should not seek an absent argument
Of my revenge thou present But look to it
Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
To seek a living in our territory
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands
Of what we think against thee
OLIVER O that your Highness knew my heart in this
FREDERICK More villain thou Well push him out of doors
And let my officers of such a nature
Make an extent upon his house and lands
Do this expediently and turn him going              Exeunt
SCENE II
The forest
Enter ORLANDO with a paper
ORLANDO Hang there my verse in witness of my love
With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
That every eye which in this forest looks
Run run Orlando carve on every tree
The fair the chaste and unexpressive she             Exit
Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
TOUCHSTONE Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in
respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in
respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect
it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life
look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty
in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in
thee shepherd
CORIN No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at
ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is
without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet
and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath
learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding
or comes of a very dull kindred
TOUCHSTONE Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
court shepherd
CORIN No truly
CORIN Nay I hope
one side
CORIN For not being at court Your reason
be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art
in a parlous state shepherd
CORIN Not a whit Touchstone Those that are good manners at the
court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not
at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
TOUCHSTONE Instance briefly come instance
CORIN Why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you
know are greasy
grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow
shallow A better instance I say come
CORIN Besides our hands are hard
TOUCHSTONE Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A
more sounder instance come
piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend civet is
the instance shepherd
make incision in thee thou art raw
CORIN Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I
to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck
TOUCHSTONE That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the
the devil himself will have no shepherds I cannot see else how
thou shouldst scape
Enter ROSALIND reading a paper
No jewel is like Rosalinde
Her worth being mounted on the wind
Through all the world bears Rosalinde
Are but black to Rosalinde
Let no face be kept in mind
suppers and sleeping hours excepted It is the right
ROSALIND Out fool
TOUCHSTONE   For a taste
If a hart do lack a hind
Let him seek out Rosalinde
If the cat will after kind
So be sure will Rosalinde
So must slender Rosalinde
They that reap must sheaf and bind
Then to cart with Rosalinde
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
Such a nut is Rosalinde
He that sweetest rose will find
This is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect
yourself with them
ROSALIND Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree
TOUCHSTONE Truly the tree yields bad fruit
virtue of the medlar
TOUCHSTONE You have said but whether wisely or no let the forest
judge
Enter CELIA with a writing
ROSALIND Peace
Here comes my sister reading stand aside
For it is unpeopled No
That shall civil sayings show
Some how brief the life of man
Runs his erring pilgrimage
That the streching of a span
Buckles in his sum of age
Some of violated vows
But upon the fairest boughs
Or at every sentence end
Will I Rosalinda write
Teaching all that read to know
The quintessence of every sprite
Heaven would in little show
Thus Rosalinde of many parts
Of many faces eyes and hearts
Heaven would that she these gifts should have
ROSALIND O most gentle pulpiter What tedious homily of love have
CELIA How now Back friends shepherd go off a little go with
him sirrah
TOUCHSTONE Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE
CELIA Didst thou hear these verses
ROSALIND O yes I heard them all and more too for some of them
had in them more feet than the verses would bear
ROSALIND Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves
without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
CELIA But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be
ROSALIND I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you
can hardly remember
CELIA Trow you who hath done this
ROSALIND Is it a man
CELIA And a chain that you once wore about his neck
Change you colour
ROSALIND I prithee who
CELIA O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but
ROSALIND Nay but who is it
CELIA Is it possible
ROSALIND Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell
me who it is
CELIA O wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet
again wonderful and after that out of all whooping
ROSALIND Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
disposition One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery
I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would
either too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork
out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings
CELIA So you may put a man in your belly
Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
CELIA Nay he hath but a little beard
ROSALIND Why God will send more if the man will be thankful Let
me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the
knowledge of his chin
and your heart both in an instant
ROSALIND Nay but the devil take mocking Speak sad brow and true
maid
ROSALIND Orlando
CELIA Orlando
ROSALIND Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose
Wherein went he What makes he here Did he ask for me Where
remains he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou see him
again Answer me in one word
particulars is more than to answer in a catechism
apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
CELIA It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and
relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a
such fruit
CELIA Give me audience good madam
ROSALIND Proceed
ROSALIND Though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes
the ground
ROSALIND O ominous he comes to kill my heart
of tune
ROSALIND Do you not know I am a woman When I think I must speak
Sweet say on
CELIA You bring me out Soft comes he not here
Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES
JAQUES I thank you for your company but good faith I had as
lief have been myself alone
ORLANDO And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too
for your society
ORLANDO I do desire we may be better strangers
JAQUES I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in
their barks
ORLANDO I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them
ORLANDO Yes just
JAQUES I do not like her name
ORLANDO There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
JAQUES What stature is she of
ORLANDO Just as high as my heart
JAQUES You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
ORLANDO Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence
you have studied your questions
heels Will you sit down with me and we two will rail against
our mistress the world and all our misery
ORLANDO I will chide no breather in the world but myself against
whom I know most faults
JAQUES The worst fault you have is to be in love
weary of you
JAQUES By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you
him
JAQUES There I shall see mine own figure
ORLANDO Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher
ORLANDO I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
Melancholy
Exit JAQUES
forester
ORLANDO Very well what would you
the forest
ROSALIND Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing
every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot
of Time as well as a clock
ORLANDO And why not the swift foot of Time Had not that been as
proper
ROSALIND By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still
withal
ORLANDO I prithee who doth he trot withal
ROSALIND Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
the length of seven year
ORLANDO Who ambles Time withal
ROSALIND With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath
not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study
and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one
lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other
knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These Time ambles
withal
ORLANDO Who doth he gallop withal
ROSALIND With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly
as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
ORLANDO Who stays it still withal
ROSALIND With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term
and term and then they perceive not how Time moves
ORLANDO Where dwell you pretty youth
ROSALIND With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of
the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
ORLANDO Are you native of this place
ROSALIND As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled
ORLANDO Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in
so removed a dwelling
ROSALIND I have been told so of many but indeed an old religious
uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland
man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I
ORLANDO Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid
to the charge of women
ROSALIND There were none principal they were all like one another
as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his
ORLANDO I prithee recount some of them
ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are
sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young
hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the
him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love
upon him
remedy
how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you
are not prisoner
ORLANDO What were his marks
ROSALIND A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken
which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not
a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that
demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man you
than seeming the lover of any other
ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love
ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love
believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess
she does That is one of the points in the which women still give
the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that
hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired
ORLANDO I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I
am that he that unfortunate he
ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as
well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why
ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing
it by counsel
ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so
ROSALIND Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his
love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which
time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate
changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish
shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and
women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like
him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now
weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his
mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to
forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook
ORLANDO I would not be cured youth
ROSALIND I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and
come every day to my cote and woo me
ORLANDO Now by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it is
you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go
ORLANDO With all my heart good youth
ROSALIND Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you
go                                                   Exeunt
SCENE III
The forest
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind
TOUCHSTONE Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats
Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet Doth my simple feature
content you
AUDREY Your features Lord warrant us What features
TOUCHSTONE I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths
good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it
strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room
Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical
word Is it a true thing
TOUCHSTONE No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning
and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may
be said as lovers they do feign
AUDREY Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst
feign
AUDREY Would you not have me honest
coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
AUDREY Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me
honest
TOUCHSTONE Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were
to put good meat into an unclean dish
AUDREY I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul
TOUCHSTONE Well praised be the gods for thy foulness
sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will
marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext
this place of the forest and to couple us
AUDREY Well the gods give us joy
TOUCHSTONE Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger
in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no
own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest
deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore
is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare
brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Here comes
Sir Oliver
Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
Sir Oliver Martext you are well met Will you dispatch us here
under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
MARTEXT Is there none here to give the woman
TOUCHSTONE I will not take her on gift of any man
MARTEXT Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
You are very well met Goddild you for your last company I am
very glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be
JAQUES Will you be married motley
TOUCHSTONE As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons
bill so wedlock would be nibbling
JAQUES And will you being a man of your breeding be married
under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good
priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but
join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me
well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me
hereafter to leave my wife
JAQUES Go thou with me and let me counsel thee
TOUCHSTONE Come sweet Audrey
We must be married or we must live in bawdry
O sweet Oliver
O brave Oliver
Leave me not behind thee
Wind away
Begone I say
I will not to wedding with thee
Exeunt JAQUES TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
shall flout me out of my calling                       Exit
SCENE IV
The forest
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
ROSALIND Never talk to me I will weep
CELIA Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears
do not become a man
ROSALIND But have I not cause to weep
CELIA As good cause as one would desire therefore weep
ROSALIND His very hair is of the dissembling colour
CELIA An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
ROSALIND And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of
holy bread
CELIA He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of
chastity is in them
ROSALIND But why did he swear he would come this morning and
comes not
CELIA Nay certainly there is no truth in him
ROSALIND Do you think so
for his verity in love I do think him as concave as covered
ROSALIND Not true in love
CELIA Yes when he is in but I think he is not in
ROSALIND You have heard him swear downright he was
stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer
of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke
your father
ROSALIND I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him
He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as
there is such a man as Orlando
words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite
traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that
spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
comes here
Enter CORIN
CORIN Mistress and master you have oft enquired
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress
CELIA Well and what of him
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you
If you will mark it
ROSALIND O come let us remove
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
Bring us to this sight and you shall say
SCENE V
Another part of the forest
Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
SILVIUS Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
Say that you love me not but say not so
In bitterness The common executioner
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon Will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN at a distance
PHEBE I would not be thy executioner
I fly thee for I would not injure thee
Who shut their coward gates on atomies
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
Some scar of it lean upon a rush
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes
That can do hurt
SILVIUS O dear Phebe
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
PHEBE But till that time
Come not thou near me and when that time comes
Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
As till that time I shall not pity thee
mother
That you insult exult and all at once
As by my faith I see no more in you
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless
Why what means this Why do you look on me
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
I think she means to tangle my eyes too
No faith proud mistress hope not after it
Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
That can entame my spirits to your worship
You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
You are a thousand times a properer man
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her
But mistress know yourself Down on your knees
For I must tell you friendly in your ear
Sell when you can you are not for all markets
Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
So take her to thee shepherd Fare you well
PHEBE Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo
in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee
you so upon me
PHEBE For no ill will I bear you
ROSALIND I pray you do not fall in love with me
For I am falser than vows made in wine
Besides I like you not If you will know my house
Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard
Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
And be not proud though all the world could see
Come to our flock        Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN
PHEBE Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might
SILVIUS Sweet Phebe
SILVIUS Sweet Phebe pity me
PHEBE Why I arn sorry for thee gentle Silvius
SILVIUS Wherever sorrow is relief would be
If you do sorrow at my grief in love
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
PHEBE Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
SILVIUS I would have you
PHEBE Why that were covetousness
Silvius the time was that I hated thee
And yet it is not that I bear thee love
But since that thou canst talk of love so well
Thy company which erst was irksome to me
But do not look for further recompense
SILVIUS So holy and so perfect is my love
And I in such a poverty of grace
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
SILVIUS Not very well but I have met him oft
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of
PHEBE Think not I love him though I ask for him
But what care I for words Yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up
There was a pretty redness in his lip
A little riper and more lusty red
Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
In parcels as I did would have gone near
To fall in love with him but for my part
I love him not nor hate him not and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him
For what had he to do to chide at me
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius
SILVIUS Phebe with all my heart
I will be bitter with him and passing short
Go with me Silvius                                  Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
The forest
Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES
JAQUES I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with
thee
ROSALIND They say you are a melancholy fellow
JAQUES I am so I do love it better than laughing
ROSALIND Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than
drunkards
melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted
from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my
travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous
sadness
ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be
to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and
poor hands
Enter ORLANDO
ROSALIND And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a
travel for it too
ORLANDO Good day and happiness dear Rosalind
JAQUES Nay then God buy you an you talk in blank verse
ROSALIND Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear
strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be
out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making
you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have
have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such
another trick never come in my sight more
ORLANDO My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise
minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the
thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said
ORLANDO Pardon me dear Rosalind
ROSALIND Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had
ORLANDO Of a snail
ROSALIND Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries
a woman besides he brings his destiny with him
ROSALIND Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to
your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents
the slander of his wife
ROSALIND And I am your Rosalind
CELIA It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a
better leer than you
ROSALIND Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour
and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I
were your very very Rosalind
ORLANDO I would kiss before I spoke
ROSALIND Nay you were better speak first and when you were
Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for
kiss
ORLANDO How if the kiss be denied
ROSALIND Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new
matter
ORLANDO Who could be out being before his beloved mistress
ROSALIND Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I
should think my honesty ranker than my wit
ORLANDO What of my suit
ROSALIND Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
Am not I your Rosalind
ORLANDO I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking
of her
ROSALIND Well in her person I say I will not have you
ORLANDO Then in mine own person I die
ROSALIND No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six
thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man
could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love
good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and
are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have
eaten them but not for love
ORLANDO I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I
protest her frown might kill me
ROSALIND By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I
what you will I will grant it
ORLANDO Then love me Rosalind
ROSALIND Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all
ORLANDO And wilt thou have me
ROSALIND Ay and twenty such
ORLANDO What sayest thou
ROSALIND Are you not good
ORLANDO I hope so
ROSALIND Why then can one desire too much of a good thing Come
sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand
Orlando What do you say sister
ORLANDO Pray thee marry us
CELIA I cannot say the words
CELIA Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind
ORLANDO I will
ROSALIND Ay but when
ORLANDO Why now as fast as she can marry us
ORLANDO I take thee Rosalind for wife
ROSALIND Now tell me how long you would have her after you have
ORLANDO For ever and a day
April when they woo December when they wed maids are May when
they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will
an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for
nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you
ORLANDO But will my Rosalind do so
ROSALIND By my life she will do as I do
ORLANDO O but she is wise
ROSALIND Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser
ORLANDO And what wit could wit have to excuse that
ROSALIND Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never
take her without her answer unless you take her without her
occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will
breed it like a fool
ORLANDO For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee
ROSALIND Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours
with thee again
ROSALIND Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would
prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less That
ORLANDO Ay sweet Rosalind
ROSALIND By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and
by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot
of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will
lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may
be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore
beware my censure and keep your promise
ORLANDO With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
Rosalind so adieu
ROSALIND Well Time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders and let Time try Adieu             Exit ORLANDO
world what the bird hath done to her own nest
ROSALIND O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst
know how many fathom deep I am in love But it cannot be sounded
my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal
CELIA Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection
in it runs out
ROSALIND No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of
shadow and sigh till he come
SCENE II
The forest
Enter JAQUES and LORDS in the habit of foresters
JAQUES Which is he that killed the deer
LORD Sir it was I
branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose
LORD Yes sir
enough
SONG
His leather skin and horns to wear
Then sing him home
Take thou no scorn to wear the horn
It was a crest ere thou wast born
And thy father bore it
The horn the horn the lusty horn
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn                   Exeunt
SCENE III
The forest
Enter ROSALIND and CELIA
And here much Orlando
CELIA I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath
comes here
Enter SILVIUS
SILVIUS My errand is to you fair youth
My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this
I know not the contents but as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it
It bears an angry tenour Pardon me
I am but as a guiltless messenger
ROSALIND Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all
She says I am not fair that I lack manners
She calls me proud and that she could not love me
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well
This is a letter of your own device
SILVIUS No I protest I know not the contents
Phebe did write it
ROSALIND Come come you are a fool
I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
I say she never did invent this letter
SILVIUS Sure it is hers
A style for challengers Why she defies me
Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter
SILVIUS So please you for I never heard it yet
ROSALIND She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
Can a woman rail thus
SILVIUS Call you this railing
Did you ever hear such railing
Meaning me a beast
Have power to raise such love in mine
Alack in me what strange effect
Would they work in mild aspect
Whiles you chid me I did love
How then might your prayers move
He that brings this love to the
Little knows this love in me
And by him seal up thy mind
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make
Or else by him my love deny
SILVIUS Call you this chiding
CELIA Alas poor shepherd
ROSALIND Do you pity him No he deserves no pity Wilt thou love
such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false
that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not
I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a
true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
Exit SILVIUS
Enter OLIVER
OLIVER Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
CELIA West of this place down in the neighbour bottom
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place
But at this hour the house doth keep itself
OLIVER If that an eye may profit by a tongue
Of female favour and bestows himself
Like a ripe sister the woman low
The owner of the house I did inquire for
OLIVER Orlando doth commend him to you both
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
He sends this bloody napkin Are you he
ROSALIND I am What must we understand by this
OLIVER Some of my shame if you will know of me
What man I am and how and why and where
CELIA I pray you tell it
OLIVER When last the young Orlando parted from you
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour and pacing through the forest
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
Lo what befell He threw his eye aside
And mark what object did present itself
And high top bald with dry antiquity
Lay sleeping on his back About his neck
The opening of his mouth but suddenly
And with indented glides did slip away
A lioness with udders all drawn dry
Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
This seen Orlando did approach the man
And found it was his brother his elder brother
CELIA O I have heard him speak of that same brother
And he did render him the most unnatural
OLIVER And well he might so do
For well I know he was unnatural
ROSALIND But to Orlando did he leave him there
But kindness nobler ever than revenge
And nature stronger than his just occasion
Made him give battle to the lioness
Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
CELIA Are you his brother
To tell you what I was since my conversion
So sweetly tastes being the thing I am
ROSALIND But for the bloody napkin
OLIVER By and by
When from the first to last betwixt us two
In brief he led me to the gentle Duke
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment
Who led me instantly unto his cave
The lioness had torn some flesh away
Which all this while had bled and now he fainted
And cried in fainting upon Rosalind
And after some small space being strong at heart
He sent me hither stranger as I am
To tell this story that you might excuse
His broken promise and to give this napkin
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind
CELIA Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede
OLIVER Many will swoon when they do look on blood
CELIA There is more in it Cousin Ganymede
OLIVER Look he recovers
ROSALIND I would I were at home
I pray you will you take him by the arm
OLIVER Be of good cheer youth You a man
ROSALIND I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think
this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how
OLIVER This was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in
your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
ROSALIND Counterfeit I assure you
OLIVER Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
right
CELIA Come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards
Good sir go with us
OLIVER That will I for I must bear answer back
How you excuse my brother Rosalind
ROSALIND I shall devise something but I pray you commend my
counterfeiting to him Will you go                   Exeunt

ROSALIND O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear
thy heart in a scarf
ORLANDO It is my arm
ROSALIND I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a
lion
ORLANDO Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
ROSALIND Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon
ORLANDO Ay and greater wonders than that
of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else
be incontinent before marriage They are in the very wrath of
love and they will together Clubs cannot part them
to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it is to look into
shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
Rosalind
ORLANDO I can live no longer by thinking
ROSALIND I will weary you then no longer with idle talking Know
a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that you should
bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you
are neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some
little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and
not to grace me Believe then if you please that I can do
with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable
If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries
it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her I
know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not
impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set
danger

am a magician Therefore put you in your best array bid your
Rosalind if you will

And so am I for Phebe

All humbleness all patience and impatience
All purity all trial all obedience

ORLANDO And so am I for Rosalind
ROSALIND And so am I for no woman

AUDREY I do desire it with all my heart and I hope it is no
dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world Here come
Enter two PAGES
FIRST PAGE Well met honest gentleman
TOUCHSTONE By my troth well met Come sit sit and a song
spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues
to a bad voice
on a horse
SONG
It was a lover and his lass
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
In the spring time the only pretty ring time
When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
Sweet lovers love the spring
Between the acres of the rye
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
These pretty country folks would lie
In the spring time &c
This carol they began that hour
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
How that a life was but a flower
In the spring time &c
And therefore take the present time
With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
For love is crowned with the prime
In the spring time &c
TOUCHSTONE Truly young gentlemen though there was no great
matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable
time
TOUCHSTONE By my troth yes I count it but time lost to hear such
a foolish song God buy you and God mend your voices Come
Audrey                                               Exeunt

You will bestow her on Orlando here
DUKE SENIOR That would I had I kingdoms to give with her

To make these doubts all even
Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA
DUKE SENIOR I do remember in this shepherd boy
ORLANDO My lord the first time that I ever saw him
Methought he was a brother to your daughter
Of many desperate studies by his uncle
Whom he reports to be a great magician
Obscured in the circle of this forest
Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY
JAQUES There is sure another flood toward and these couples are
coming to the ark Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
TOUCHSTONE Salutation and greeting to you all
gentleman that I have so often met in the forest He hath been a
courtier he swears
TOUCHSTONE If any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation

one
TOUCHSTONE Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
seventh cause
JAQUES How seventh cause Good my lord like this fellow
DUKE SENIOR I like him very well
here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear
and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks A
poor humour of mine sir to take that that man else will Rich
honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl
in your foul oyster
DUKE SENIOR By my faith he is very swift and sententious
diseases
JAQUES But for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on
the seventh cause
Courteous If I sent him word again it was not well cut he would
Modest If again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment
Valiant If again it was not well cut he would say I lie This
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct
JAQUES And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
TOUCHSTONE I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial nor
and parted
JAQUES Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
TOUCHSTONE O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
books for good manners I will name you the degrees The first
the Retort Courteous the second the Quip Modest the third the
Reply Churlish the fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the
Countercheck Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with Circumstance
the seventh the Lie Direct All these you may avoid but the Lie
Direct and you may avoid that too with an If I knew when seven
justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were
JAQUES Is not this a rare fellow my lord
presentation of that he shoots his wit
Enter HYMEN ROSALIND and CELIA Still MUSIC
HYMEN    Then is there mirth in heaven
When earthly things made even
Atone together
Good Duke receive thy daughter
Hymen from heaven brought her
Yea brought her hither
That thou mightst join her hand with his
Whose heart within his bosom is
DUKE SENIOR If there be truth in sight you are my daughter
ORLANDO If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind
PHEBE If sight and shape be true
Why then my love adieu
HYMEN    Peace ho I bar confusion
Of these most strange events
If truth holds true contents
You and you no cross shall part
You and you are heart in heart
You to his love must accord
Or have a woman to your lord
You and you are sure together
As the winter to foul weather
Feed yourselves with questioning
That reason wonder may diminish
How thus we met and these things finish
SONG
O blessed bond of board and bed
High wedlock then be honoured
Honour high honour and renown
To Hymen god of every town

Even daughter welcome in no less degree
PHEBE I will not eat my word now thou art mine
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine
Enter JAQUES de BOYS
JAQUES de BOYS Let me have audience for a word or two
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly
Duke Frederick hearing how that every day
Men of great worth resorted to this forest
In his own conduct purposely to take
His brother here and put him to the sword
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
Where meeting with an old religious man
After some question with him was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world
I do engage my life
DUKE SENIOR Welcome young man
To one his lands withheld and to the other
A land itself at large a potent dukedom
First in this forest let us do those ends
That here were well begun and well begot
And after every of this happy number
Shall share the good of our returned fortune
According to the measure of their states
And fall into our rustic revelry
Play music and you brides and bridegrooms all
JAQUES Sir by your patience If I heard you rightly
The Duke hath put on a religious life
And thrown into neglect the pompous court
JAQUES DE BOYS He hath
JAQUES To him will I Out of these convertites
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it
I am for other than for dancing measures
DUKE SENIOR Stay Jaques stay
JAQUES To see no pastime I What you would have
DUKE SENIOR Proceed proceed We will begin these rites
EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
ROSALIND It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but
it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue If it
needs no epilogue Yet to good wine they do use good bushes and
good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues What a
case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot
insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not
you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of
this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love
If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that
not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces
or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy
bid me farewell

THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
ACT I SCENE 1
Enter the DUKE OF EPHESUS AEGEON the Merchant
of Syracuse GAOLER OFFICERS and other ATTENDANTS
AEGEON Proceed Solinus to procure my fall
And by the doom of death end woes and all
DUKE Merchant of Syracuse plead no more
I am not partial to infringe our laws
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
For since the mortal and intestine jars
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns
Nay more if any born at Ephesus
Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs
Again if any Syracusian born
Unless a thousand marks be levied
To quit the penalty and to ransom him
Thy substance valued at the highest rate
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks
AEGEON Yet this my comfort when your words are done
My woes end likewise with the evening sun
DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable
Yet that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature not by vile offence
In Syracuse was I born and wed
Unto a woman happy but for me
And by me had not our hap been bad
By prosperous voyages I often made
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was
There had she not been long but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons
And which was strange the one so like the other
A mean woman was delivered
Of such a burden male twins both alike
Those for their parents were exceeding poor
I bought and brought up to attend my sons
My wife not meanly proud of two such boys
Made daily motions for our home return
Unwilling I agreed Alas too soon
We came aboard
Gave any tragic instance of our harm
But longer did we not retain much hope
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife
Weeping before for what she saw must come
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes
And this it was for other means was none
The sailors sought for safety by our boat
To him one of the other twins was bound
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other
And floating straight obedient to the stream
Was carried towards Corinth as we thought
At length the sun gazing upon the earth
And by the benefit of his wished light
Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this
Gather the sequel by that went before
DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so
For we may pity though not pardon thee
AEGEON O had the gods done so I had not now
For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
Which being violently borne upon
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
So that in this unjust divorce of us
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in what to sorrow for
Her part poor soul seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe
Was carried with more speed before the wind
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth as we thought
And knowing whom it was their hap to save
And would have reft the fishers of their prey
Had not their bark been very slow of sail
And therefore homeward did they bend their course
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps
DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
Do me the favour to dilate at full
AEGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care
At eighteen years became inquisitive
Might bear him company in the quest of him
Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see
Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia
And coasting homeward came to Ephesus
Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men
But here must end the story of my life
And happy were I in my timely death
Could all my travels warrant me they live
To bear the extremity of dire mishap
Now trust me were it not against our laws
Against my crown my oath my dignity
Which princes would they may not disannul
My soul should sue as advocate for thee
But though thou art adjudged to the death
Yet will I favour thee in what I can
To seek thy help by beneficial hap
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus
Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum
Gaoler take him to thy custody
GAOLER I will my lord
AEGEON Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend
But to procrastinate his lifeless end
<Exeunt
SCENE 2
The mart
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE DROMIO OF SYRACUSE and FIRST MERCHANT
FIRST MERCHANT Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west
There is your money that I had to keep
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Go bear it to the Centaur where we host
And stay there Dromio till I come to thee
Peruse the traders gaze upon the buildings
And then return and sleep within mine inn
For with long travel I am stiff and weary
Get thee away
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Many a man would take you at your word
And go indeed having so good a mean
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE A trusty villain sir that very oft
When I am dull with care and melancholy
Lightens my humour with his merry jests
What will you walk with me about the town
And then go to my inn and dine with me
FIRST MERCHANT I am invited sir to certain merchants
Of whom I hope to make much benefit
And afterward consort you till bed time
My present business calls me from you now
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Farewell till then I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city
FIRST MERCHANT Sir I commend you to your own content
<Exit FIRST MERCHANT
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop
Who falling there to find his fellow forth
Unseen inquisitive confounds himself
So I to find a mother and a brother
In quest of them unhappy lose myself
Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
Here comes the almanac of my true date
The capon burns the pig falls from the spit
My mistress made it one upon my cheek
She is so hot because the meat is cold
The meat is cold because you come not home
You come not home because you have no stomach
You have no stomach having broke your fast
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Stop in your wind sir tell me this I pray
Where have you left the money that I gave you
The saddler had it sir I kept it not
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I am not in a sportive humour now
Tell me and dally not where is the money
So great a charge from thine own custody
DROMIO OF EPHESUS I pray you jest sir as you sit at dinner
I from my mistress come to you in post
If I return I shall be post indeed
For she will score your fault upon my pate
Methinks your maw like mine should be your clock
And strike you home without a messenger
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Come Dromio come these jests are out of season
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee
DROMIO OF EPHESUS To me sir Why you gave no gold to me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Come on sir knave have done your foolishness
DROMIO OF EPHESUS My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house the Phoenix sir to dinner
My mistress and her sister stays for you
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Now as I am a Christian answer me
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me
DROMIO OF EPHESUS I have some marks of yours upon my pate
But not a thousand marks between you both
If I should pay your worship those again
Perchance you will not bear them patiently
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What wilt thou flout me thus unto my face
Being forbid There take you that sir knave
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Upon my life by some device or other
They say this town is full of cozenage
As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye
Disguised cheaters prating mountebanks
If it prove so I will be gone the sooner
I greatly fear my money is not safe

ACT Il SCENE 1
The house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Enter ADRIANA wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with LUCIANA her sister
That in such haste I sent to seek his master
LUCIANA Perhaps some merchant hath invited him
Good sister let us dine and never fret
A man is master of his liberty
Time is their master and when they see time
ADRIANA Why should their liberty than ours be more
ADRIANA Look when I serve him so he takes it ill
LUCIANA O know he is the bridle of your will
But hath his bound in earth in sea in sky
The beasts the fishes and the winged fowls
Man more divine the master of all these
Are masters to their females and their lords
Then let your will attend on their accords
ADRIANA This servitude makes you to keep unwed
ADRIANA But were you wedded you would bear some sway
ADRIANA How if your husband start some other where
LUCIANA Till he come home again I would forbear
They can be meek that have no other cause
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry
As much or more we should ourselves complain
So thou that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee
With urging helpless patience would relieve me
But if thou live to see like right bereft
LUCIANA Well I will marry one day but to try
Here comes your man now is your husband nigh
Enter DROMIO OF EPHESUS
ADRIANA Say is your tardy master now at hand
ears can witness
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ay ay he told his mind upon mine ear
Beshrew his hand I scarce could understand it
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay he struck so plainly I could to
well feel his blows and withal so doubtfully that I could
scarce understand them
ADRIANA But say I prithee is he coming home
It seems he hath great care to please his wife
But sure he is stark mad
LUCIANA Quoth who
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Quoth my master
So that my errand due unto my tongue
I thank him I bare home upon my shoulders
For in conclusion he did beat me there
ADRIANA Go back again thou slave and fetch him home
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Go back again and be new beaten home
ADRIANA Back slave or I will break thy pate across
DROMIO OF EPHESUS And he will bless that cross with other beating
Between you I shall have a holy head
ADRIANA Hence prating peasant Fetch thy master home
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Am I so round with you as you with me
That like a football you do spurn me thus
You spurn me hence and he will spurn me hither
If I last in this service you must case me in leather
<Exit
LUCIANA Fie how impatience loureth in your face
ADRIANA His company must do his minions grace
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look
From my poor cheek Then he hath wasted it
Are my discourses dull Barren my wit
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard
Do their gay vestments his affections bait
What ruins are in me that can be found
Of my defeatures My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But too unruly deer he breaks the pale
And feeds from home poor I am but his stale
ADRIANA Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere
Or else what lets it but he would be here
Would that alone a love he would detain
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty yet the gold bides still
That others touch and often touching will
Where gold and no man that hath a name
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye
LUCIANA How many fond fools serve mad jealousy
<Exeunt
SCENE 2
The mart
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur and the heedful slave
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart See here he comes
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
As you love strokes so jest with me again
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner
My house was at the Phoenix Wast thou mad
That thus so madly thou didst answer me
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE What answer sir When spake I such a word
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Even now even here not half an hour since
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I did not see you since you sent me hence
Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am glad to see you in this merry vein
What means this jest I pray you master tell me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Yea dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth
Upon what bargain do you give it me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams
If you will jest with me know my aspect
And fashion your demeanour to my looks
Or I will beat this method in your sconce
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sconce call you it So you would
leave battering I had rather have it a head An you use
these blows long I must get a sconce for my head and
insconce it too or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders
But I pray sir why am I beaten
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Dost thou not know
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nothing sir but that I am beaten
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Shall I tell you why
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Ay sir and wherefore for they say
every why hath a wherefore
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why first for flouting me and then wherefore
For urging it the second time to me
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason
Well sir I thank you
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thank me sir for what
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir for this something that you gave
me for nothing
give you nothing for something But say sir is it dinnertime
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No sir I think the meat wants that I have
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Basting
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE If it be sir I pray you eat none of it
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Your reason
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Lest it make you choleric and purchase me
another dry basting
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Well sir learn to jest in good time
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I durst have denied that before you
were so choleric
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By what rule sir
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir by a rule as plain as the
plain bald pate of Father Time himself
his hair that grows bald by nature
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE May he not do it by fine and recovery
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Yes to pay a fine for a periwig and
recover the lost hair of another man
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why is Time such a niggard of
hair being as it is so plentiful an excrement
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Because it is a blessing that he bestows
on beasts and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath
given them in wit
hath more hair than wit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not a man of those but he hath the
wit to lose his hair
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Why thou didst conclude hairy
men plain dealers without wit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The plainer dealer the sooner lost
yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE For what reason
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE For two and sound ones too
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay not sound I pray you
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Sure ones then
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Nay not sure in a thing falsing
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Certain ones then
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Name them
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE The one to save the money that he spends in
tiring the other that at dinner they should not drop in his
porridge
is no time for all things
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry and did sir namely no time to recover
hair lost by nature
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE But your reason was not substantial why
there is no time to recover
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Thus I mend it Time himself is bald
soft who wafts us yonder
Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA
ADRIANA Ay ay Antipholus look strange and frown
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects
I am not Adriana nor thy wife
That never words were music to thine ear
That never object pleasing in thine eye
That never touch well welcome to thy hand
How comes it now my husband O how comes it
That thou art then estranged from thyself
Thyself I call it being strange to me
That undividable incorporate
Ah do not tear away thyself from me
For know my love as easy mayst thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf
And take unmingled thence that drop again
Without addition or diminishing
As take from me thyself and not me too
How dearly would it touch thee to the quick
And that this body consecrate to thee
By ruffian lust should be contaminate
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
I know thou canst and therefore see thou do it
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust
For if we two be one and thou play false
I do digest the poison of thy flesh
Being strumpeted by thy contagion
Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Plead you to me fair dame I know you not
In Ephesus I am but two hours old
As strange unto your town as to your talk
Wants wit in all one word to understand
When were you wont to use my sister thus
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE By Dromio
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE By me
That he did buffet thee and in his blows
Denied my house for his me for his wife
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Did you converse sir with this gentlewoman
What is the course and drift of your compact
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I Sir I never saw her till this time
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Villain thou liest for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I never spake with her in all my life
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How can she thus then call us by our names
Unless it be by inspiration
ADRIANA How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt
Come I will fasten on this sleeve of thine
Thou art an elm my husband I a vine
Whose weakness married to thy stronger state
Makes me with thy strength to communicate
If aught possess thee from me it is dross
Usurping ivy brier or idle moss
Who all for want of pruning with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE To me she speaks she moves me for her theme
What was I married to her in my dream
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss
Until I know this sure uncertainty
LUCIANA Dromio go bid the servants spread for dinner
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O for my beads I cross me for sinner
This is the fairy land O spite of spites
We talk with goblins owls and sprites
If we obey them not this will ensue
Dromio thou drone thou snail thou slug thou sot
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I am transformed master am not I
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think thou art in mind and so am I
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nay master both in mind and in my shape
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou hast thine own form
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No I am an ape
But I should know her as well as she knows me
ADRIANA Come come no longer will I be a fool
To put the finger in the eye and weep
Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn
Come sir to dinner Dromio keep the gate
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks
Sirrah if any ask you for your master
Say he dines forth and let no creature enter
Come sister Dromio play the porter well
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Am I in earth in heaven or in hell
And in this mist at all adventures go
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master shall I be porter at the gate
ADRIANA Ay and let none enter lest I break your pate
LUCIANA Come come Antipholus we dine too late

ACT III SCENE 1
Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS DROMIO OF EPHESUS ANGELO and BALTHAZAR
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Good Signior Angelo you must excuse us all
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours
To see the making of her carcanet
He met me on the mart and that I beat him
And that I did deny my wife and house
Thou drunkard thou what didst thou mean by this
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Say what you will sir but I know what I know
That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show
If the skin were parchment and the blows you gave were ink
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I think thou art an ass
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Marry so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass
May answer my good will and your good welcome here
BALTHAZAR I hold your dainties cheap sir and your welcome dear
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS O Signior Balthazar either at flesh or fish
A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish
BALTHAZAR Good meat sir is common that every churl affords
but words
BALTHAZAR Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Ay to a niggardly host and more sparing guest
But though my cates be mean take them in good part
Better cheer may you have but not with better heart
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Maud Bridget Marian Cicely Gillian Ginn
Either get thee from the door or sit down at the hatch
When one is one too many Go get thee from the door
DROMIO OF EPHESUS What patch is made our porter
My master stays in the street
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Who talks within there Ho open the door
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Wherefore For my dinner
come again when you may
from the house I owe
sir and my name is Dromio
office and my name
Enter LUCE within
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Let my master in Luce
And so tell your master
DROMIO OF EPHESUS O Lord I must laugh
Have at you with a proverb Shall I set in my staff
DROMIO OF EPHESUS SO Come help well struck there was blow for blow
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Thou baggage let me in
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Master knock the door hard
Enter ADRIANA within
troubled with unruly boys
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Are you there wife You might
have come before
ANGELO Here is neither cheer sir nor welcome we would fain have either
BALTHAZAR In debating which was best we shall part with neither
DROMIO OF EPHESUS They stand at the door master bid them welcome hither
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There is something in the wind that we cannot get in
DROMIO OF EPHESUS You would say so master if your garments were thin
Your cake here is warm within you stand here in the cold
It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold
DROMIO OF EPHESUS A man may break a word with you
sir and words are but wind
Ay and break it in your face so he break it not behind
out upon thee hind
feathers and fish have no fin
DROMIO OF EPHESUS A crow without feather Master mean you so
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Go get thee gone fetch me an iron crow
BALTHAZAR Have patience sir O let it not be so
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
Her sober virtue years and modesty
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown
And doubt not sir but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day
A vulgar comment will be made of it
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead
For slander lives upon succession
And in despite of mirth mean to be merry
I know a wench of excellent discourse
Pretty and witty wild and yet too gentle
There will we dine This woman that I mean
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal
Bring it I pray you to the Porpentine
Upon mine hostess there good sir make haste
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Do so this jest shall cost me some expense
<Exeunt
SCENE 2
Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
Enter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE
LUCIANA And may it be that you have quite forgot
Shall love in building grow so ruinous
If you did wed my sister for her wealth
Or if you like elsewhere do it by stealth
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness
Let not my sister read it in your eye
Look sweet speak fair become disloyalty
Bear a fair presence though your heart be tainted
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint
What simple thief brags of his own attaint
And let her read it in thy looks at board
Shame hath a bastard fame well managed
Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word
Alas poor women make us but believe
Being compact of credit that you love us
Though others have the arm show us the sleeve
We in your motion turn and you may move us
Then gentle brother get you in again
Comfort my sister cheer her call her wife
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
Teach me dear creature how to think and speak
To make it wander in an unknown field
Are you a god Would you create me new
But if that I am I then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more far more to you do I decline
O train me not sweet mermaid with thy note
Sing siren for thyself and I will dote
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die
Let Love being light be drowned if she sink
LUCIANA What are you mad that you do reason so
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Not mad but mated how I do not know
LUCIANA It is a fault that springeth from your eye
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE For gazing on your beams fair sun being by
LUCIANA Gaze where you should and that will clear your sight
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE As good to wink sweet love as look on night
LUCIANA Why call you me love Call my sister so
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE No
LUCIANA All this my sister is or else should be
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Call thyself sister sweet for I am thee
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife
Give me thy hand
LUCIANA O soft sir hold you still
<Exit LUCIANA
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Do you know me sir Am I Dromio

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art Dromio thou art my
man thou art thyself

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir besides myself I am due
that will have me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What claim lays she to thee
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir such claim as you would
lay to your horse and she would have me as a beast not
that I being a beast she would have me but that she
being a very beastly creature lays claim to me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What is she
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE A very reverent body ay such a one
I have but lean luck in the match and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE How dost thou mean a fat marriage
and all grease and I know not what use to put her to but
to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light
I warrant her rags and the tallow in them will burn
week longer than the whole world
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What complexion is she of
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Swart like my shoe but her face
nothing like so clean kept for why she sweats a man may
go over shoes in the grime of it
could not do it
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Nell sir but her name and three
her from hip to hip
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Then she bears some breadth
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE No longer from head to foot than
from hip to hip she is spherical like a globe I could find
out countries in her
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE In what part of her body stands Ireland
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Marry sir in her buttocks I found it out by
the bogs
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where Scotland
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I found it by the barrenness hard in
the palm of the hand
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where France
making war against her heir
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where England
could find no whiteness in them but I guess it stood in her
chin by the salt rheum that ran between France and it
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where Spain
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Faith I saw it not but I felt it hot in
her breath
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where America the Indies
rubies carbuncles sapphires declining their rich aspect to the
hot breath of Spain who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be
ballast at her nose
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Where stood Belgia the Netherlands
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O Sir I did not look so low To
marks I had about me as the mark of my shoulder the
mole in my neck the great wart on my left arm that I
And I think if my breast had not been made of faith
and my heart of steel
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Go hie thee presently post to the road
An if the wind blow any way from shore
If any bark put forth come to the mart
Where I will walk till thou return to me
If every one knows us and we know none
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE As from a bear a man would run for life
So fly I from her that would be my wife
<Exit
She that doth call me husband even my soul
Doth for a wife abhor But her fair sister
Of such enchanting presence and discourse
Hath almost made me traitor to myself
Enter ANGELO with the chain
ANGELO Master Antipholus
ANGELO I know it well sir Lo here is the chain
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What is your will that I shall do with this
ANGELO What please yourself sir I have made it for you
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Made it for me sir I bespoke it not
ANGELO Not once nor twice but twenty times you have
Go home with it and please your wife withal
And then receive my money for the chain
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I pray you sir receive the money now
ANGELO You are a merry man sir fare you well
<Exit
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE What I should think of this cannot tell
I see a man here needs not live by shifts
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts
If any ship put out then straight away
<Exit

ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS A man is well holp up that trusts to you
I promised your presence and the chain
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me
Belike you thought our love would last too long
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
Than I stand debted to this gentleman
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it
Besides I have some business in the town
Good signior take the stranger to my house
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof

ANGELO Well sir I will Have you the chain about you

ADRIANA Ah Luciana did he tempt thee so
That he did plead in earnest Yea or no

LUCIANA Then swore he that he was a stranger here
ADRIANA And true he swore though yet forsworn he were
LUCIANA Then pleaded I for you
ADRIANA And what said he
ADRIANA With what persuasion did he tempt thy love
LUCIANA With words that in an honest suit might move
First he did praise my beauty then my speech
ADRIANA Didst speak him fair
LUCIANA Have patience I beseech
ADRIANA I cannot nor I will not hold me still
My tongue though not my heart shall have his will
He is deformed crooked old and sere
Vicious ungentle foolish blunt unkind
Stigmatical in making worse in mind
LUCIANA Who would be jealous then of such a one
ADRIANA Ah but I think him better than I say
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away
My heart prays for him though my tongue do curse
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

ADRIANA Where is thy master Dromio Is he well

One that before the Judgment carries poor souls to hell
ADRIANA Why man what is the matter
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I do not know the matter he is rested on the case
ADRIANA What is he arrested Tell me at whose suit
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I know not at whose suit he is arrested well
Will you send him mistress redemption the money in his desk

A chain a chain Do you not hear it ring
ADRIANA What the chain

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O yes If any hour meet a sergeant
ADRIANA As if Time were in debt How fondly dost thou reason

And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here
Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

COURTEZAN Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner

ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Avaunt thou witch Come Dromio let us go
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
COURTEZAN Now out of doubt Antipholus is mad
Else would he never so demean himself
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats
Both one and other he denies me now
The reason that I gather he is mad
Besides this present instance of his rage
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance
Belike his wife acquainted with his fits
On purpose shut the doors against his way
My way is now to hie home to his house
And tell his wife that being lunatic
My ring away This course I fittest choose
For forty ducats is too much to lose

DROMIO OF EPHESUS In verity you did My bones bear witness
That since have felt the vigour of his rage
PINCH It is no shame the fellow finds his vein
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy
ADRIANA Alas I sent you money to redeem you
By Dromio here who came in haste for it
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Money by me Heart and goodwill you might
But surely master not a rag of money
LUCIANA And I am witness with her that she did
That I was sent for nothing but a rope

They must be bound and laid in some dark room
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold
ADRIANA I did not gentle husband lock thee forth
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Dissembling harlot thou art false in all

ACT V SCENE 1
A street before a priory
Enter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO
But I protest he had the chain of me
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it
ANGELO Of very reverend reputation sir
Second to none that lives here in the city
His word might bear my wealth at any time
SECOND MERCHANT Speak softly yonder as I think he walks
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE
Which he forswore most monstrously to have
Signior Andpholus I wonder much
That you would put me to this shame and trouble
And not without some scandal to yourself
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
This chain which now you wear so openly
Beside the charge the shame imprisonment
You have done wrong to this my honest friend
Who but for staying on our controversy
This chain you had of me can you deny it
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think I had I never did deny it
SECOND MERCHANT Yes that you did sir and forswore it too
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Who heard me to deny it or forswear it
To walk where any honest men resort
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Thou art a villain to impeach me thus
SECOND MERCHANT I dare and do defy thee for a villain
Enter ADRIANA LUCIANA the COURTEZAN and OTHERS
Some get within him take his sword away
Bind Dromio too and bear them to my house
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE to the priory
Enter the LADY ABBESS
ABBESS Be quiet people Wherefore throng you hither
ADRIANA To fetch my poor distracted husband hence
Let us come in that we may bind him fast
And bear him home for his recovery
ANGELO I knew he was not in his perfect wits
SECOND MERCHANT I am sorry now that I did draw on him
ABBESS How long hath this possession held the man
ADRIANA This week he hath been heavy sour sad
And much different from the man he was
But till this afternoon his passion
ABBESS Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea
Buried some dear friend Hath not else his eye
A sin prevailing much in youthful men
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing
Which of these sorrows is he subject to
ADRIANA To none of these except it be the last
Namely some love that drew him oft from home
ABBESS You should for that have reprehended him
ADRIANA Why so I did
ABBESS Ay but not rough enough
ADRIANA As roughly as my modesty would let me
ABBESS Haply in private
ADRIANA And in assemblies too
ABBESS Ay but not enough
ADRIANA It was the copy of our conference
In bed he slept not for my urging it
At board he fed not for my urging it
Alone it was the subject of my theme
In company I often glanced it
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad
ABBESS And thereof came it that the man was mad
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
And thereof comes it that his head is light
Unquiet meals make ill digestions
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred
But moody and dull melancholy
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
LUCIANA She never reprehended him but mildly
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not
ADRIANA She did betray me to my own reproof
Good people enter and lay hold on him
ABBESS No not a creature enters in my house
ADRIANA Then let your servants bring my husband forth
ABBESS Neither he took this place for sanctuary
And it shall privilege him from your hands
Till I have brought him to his wits again
Or lose my labour in assaying it
ADRIANA I will attend my husband be his nurse
Diet his sickness for it is my office
And will have no attorney but myself
And therefore let me have him home with me
ABBESS Be patient for I will not let him stir
With wholesome syrups drugs and holy prayers
To make of him a formal man again
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath
A charitable duty of my order
Therefore depart and leave him here with me
ADRIANA I will not hence and leave my husband here
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
To separate the husband and the wife
ABBESS Be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him
<Exit
LUCIANA Complain unto the Duke of this indignity
ADRIANA Come go I will fall prostrate at his feet
And never rise until my tears and prayers
Have won his Grace to come in person hither
And take perforce my husband from the Abbess
SECOND MERCHANT By this I think the dial points at five
Comes this way to the melancholy vale
The place of death and sorry execution
Behind the ditches of the abbey here
ANGELO Upon what cause
SECOND MERCHANT To see a reverend Syracusian merchant
Who put unluckily into this bay
Against the laws and statutes of this town
Beheaded publicly for his offence
ANGELO See where they come we will behold his death
LUCIANA Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey
Enter the DUKE attended AEGEON bareheaded
with the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS
DUKE Yet once again proclaim it publicly
If any friend will pay the sum for him
He shall not die so much we tender him
ADRIANA Justice most sacred Duke against the Abbess
DUKE She is a virtuous and a reverend lady
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong
ADRIANA May it please your Grace Antipholus my husband
Who I made lord of me and all I had
A most outrageous fit of madness took him
With him his bondman all as mad as he
Doing displeasure to the citizens
By rushing in their houses bearing thence
Rings jewels anything his rage did like
Once did I get him bound and sent him home
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went
That here and there his fury had committed
Anon I wot not by what strong escape
He broke from those that had the guard of him
And with his mad attendant and himself
Each one with ireful passion with drawn swords
Met us again and madly bent on us
We came again to bind them Then they fled
And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us
And will not suffer us to fetch him out
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence
Therefore most gracious Duke with thy command
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help
When thou didst make him master of thy bed
To do him all the grace and good I could
Go some of you knock at the abbey gate
And bid the Lady Abbess come to me
I will determine this before I stir
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER O mistress mistress shift and save yourself
My master and his man are both broke loose
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
My master preaches patience to him and the while
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool
And sure unless you send some present help
Between them they will kill the conjurer
ADRIANA Peace fool thy master and his man are here
And that is false thou dost report to us
MESSENGER Mistress upon my life I tell you true
He cries for you and vows if he can take you
To scorch your face and to disfigure you
Hark hark I hear him mistress fly be gone
DUKE Come stand by me fear nothing Guard with halberds
ADRIANA Ay me it is my husband Witness you
That he is borne about invisible
Enter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS Justice most gracious Duke O grant me justice
Even for the service that long since I did thee
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
Deep scars to save thy life even for the blood
That then I lost for thee now grant me justice
AEGEON Unless the fear of death doth make me dote
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS Justice sweet Prince against that woman there
That hath abused and dishonoured me
Even in the strength and height of injury
Beyond imagination is the wrong
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me
DUKE Discover how and thou shalt find me just
ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS This day great Duke she shut the doors upon me
While she with harlots feasted in my house
DUKE A grievous fault Say woman didst thou so
ADRIANA No my good lord Myself he and my sister
As this is false he burdens me withal
But she tells to your Highness simple truth
In this the madman justly chargeth them
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS My liege I am advised what I say
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad
Could witness it for he was with me then
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine
Where Balthazar and I did dine together
Our dinner done and he not coming thither
I went to seek him In the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman
Which God he knows I saw not for the which
He did arrest me with an officer
I did obey and sent my peasant home
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house
Of vile confederates Along with them
A mere anatomy a mountebank
A living dead man This pernicious slave
Forsooth took on him as a conjurer
And gazing in mine eyes feeling my pulse
They fell upon me bound me bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man both bound together
Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
Ran hither to your Grace whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities
ANGELO My lord in truth thus far I witness with him
DUKE But had he such a chain of thee or no
ANGELO He had my lord and when he ran in here
These people saw the chain about his neck
SECOND MERCHANT Besides I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart
And thereupon I drew my sword on you
And then you fled into this abbey here
From whence I think you are come by miracle
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never came within these abbey walls
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me
I never saw the chain so help me Heaven
And this is false you burden me withal
DUKE Why what an intricate impeach is this
If he were mad he would not plead so coldly
Denies that saying Sirrah what say you
COURTEZAN As sure my liege as I do see your Grace
DUKE Why this is strange Go call the Abbess hither
I think you are all mated or stark mad
<Exit one to the ABBESS
AEGEON Most mighty Duke vouchsafe me speak a word
Haply I see a friend will save my life
And pay the sum that may deliver me
DUKE Speak freely Syracusian what thou wilt
And is not that your bondman Dromio
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Within this hour I was his bondman sir
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound
AEGEON I am sure you both of you remember me
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ourselves we do remember sir by you
For lately we were bound as you are now
AEGEON Why look you strange on me You know me well
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw you in my life till now
Have written strange defeatures in my face
But tell me yet dost thou not know my voice
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Neither
AEGEON Dromio nor thou
DROMIO OF EPHESUS No trust me sir nor I
AEGEON I am sure thou dost
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Ay sir but I am sure I do not and
whatsoever a man denies you are now bound to believe him
In seven short years that here my only son
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
And all the conduits of my blood froze up
Yet hath my night of life some memory
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I never saw my father in my life
AEGEON But seven years since in Syracuse boy
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS The Duke and all that know me in
the city Can witness with me that it is not so
DUKE I tell thee Syracusian twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote
ADRIANA I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me
DUKE One of these men is genius to the other
And so of these Which is the natural man
And which the spirit Who deciphers them
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE I sir am Dromio command him away
DROMIO OF EPHESUS I Sir am Dromio pray let me stay
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE Aegeon art thou not or else his
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE O my old master who hath bound
ABBESS Whoever bound him I will loose his bonds
And gain a husband by his liberty
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons
And speak unto the same Aemilia
AEGEON If I dream not thou art Aemilia
If thou art she tell me where is that son
That floated with thee on the fatal raft
ABBESS By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in
DUKE Why here begins his morning story right
These are the parents to these children
Which accidentally are met together
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE No sir not I I came from Syracuse
DUKE Stay stand apart I know not which is which
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS I came from Corinth my most gracious lord
DROMIO OF EPHESUS And I with him
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS Brought to this town by that most famous warrior
Duke Menaphon your most renowned uncle
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I gentle mistress
ADRIANA And are not you my husband
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS No I say nay to that
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE And so do I yet did she call me so
And this fair gentlewoman her sister here
I hope I shall have leisure to make good
If this be not a dream I see and hear
ANGELO That is the chain sir which you had of me
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE I think it be sir I deny it not
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS And you sir for this chain arrested me
ANGELO I think I did sir I deny it not
ADRIANA I sent you money sir to be your bail
By Dromio but I think he brought it not
DROMIO OF EPHESUS No none by me
And Dromio my man did bring them me
And thereupon these ERRORS are arose
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS These ducats pawn I for my father here
DUKE It shall not need thy father hath his life
COURTEZAN Sir I must have that diamond from you
ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS There take it and much thanks for my
good cheer
ABBESS Renowned Duke vouchsafe to take the pains
To go with us into the abbey here
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes
And all that are assembled in this place
And we shall make full satisfaction
Of you my sons and till this present hour
The Duke my husband and my children both
And you the calendars of their nativity
After so long grief such nativity
<Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE ANTIPHOLUS OF
EPHESUS DROMIO OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF EPHESUS
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Master shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Your goods that lay at host sir in the Centaur
ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE He speaks to me I am your master Dromio
Embrace thy brother there rejoice with him
<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS
She now shall be my sister not my wife
DROMIO OF EPHESUS Methinks you are my glass and not my brother
Will you walk in to see their gossiping
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE Not I sir you are my elder

DROMIO OF EPHESUS Nay then thus
We came into the world like brother and brother

SCENE
Rome and the neighbourhood Corioli and the neighbourhood Antium
ACT I SCENE I
Rome A street
Enter a company of mutinous citizens with staves clubs and other weapons
FIRST CITIZEN Before we proceed any further hear me speak
ALL Speak speak
FIRST CITIZEN First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the
people
SECOND CITIZEN One word good citizens
FIRST CITIZEN We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield
us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess
they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear The
leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a
gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become
rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in
thirst for revenge
SECOND CITIZEN Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius
commonalty
SECOND CITIZEN Consider you what services he has done for his
country
FIRST CITIZEN Very well and could be content to give him good
SECOND CITIZEN Nay but speak not maliciously
FIRST CITIZEN I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it
was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be
partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue
SECOND CITIZEN What he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous
FIRST CITIZEN If I must not I need not be barren of accusations
ALL Come come
FIRST CITIZEN Soft who comes here
Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA
the people
With bats and clubs The matter Speak I pray you
they shall know we have strong arms too
MENENIUS Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
Will you undo yourselves
FIRST CITIZEN We cannot sir we are undone already
MENENIUS I tell you friends most charitable care
Have the patricians of you For your wants
Your suffering in this dearth you may as well
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
Against the Roman state whose course will on
The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
Of more strong link asunder than can ever
Appear in your impediment For the dearth
The gods not the patricians make it and
Your knees to them not arms must help Alack
You are transported by calamity
Thither where more attends you and you slander
When you curse them as enemies
grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily
any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor If the
MENENIUS Either you must
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious
A pretty tale It may be you have heard it
But since it serves my purpose I will venture
That only like a gulf it did remain
Still cupboarding the viand never bearing
Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
And mutually participate did minister
Unto the appetite and affection common
FIRST CITIZEN Well sir what answer made the belly
MENENIUS Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile
For look you I may make the belly smile
That envied his receipt even so most fitly
As you malign our senators for that
They are not such as you
The kingly crowned head the vigilant eye
The counsellor heart the arm our soldier
Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
With other muniments and petty helps
MENENIUS What then
Fore me this fellow speaks What then What then
MENENIUS Well what then
FIRST CITIZEN The former agents if they did complain
What could the belly answer
MENENIUS I will tell you
MENENIUS Note me this good friend
Your most grave belly was deliberate
Not rash like his accusers and thus answered
Which you do live upon and fit it is
Because I am the storehouse and the shop
Of the whole body But if you do remember
I send it through the rivers of your blood
And through the cranks and offices of man
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
From me receive that natural competency
Whereby they live And though that all at once
FIRST CITIZEN Ay sir well well
See what I do deliver out to each
Yet I can make my audit up that all
From me do back receive the flour of all
FIRST CITIZEN It was an answer How apply you this
MENENIUS The senators of Rome are this good belly
And you the mutinous members for examine
Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
No public benefit which you receive
But it proceeds or comes from them to you
And no way from yourselves What do you think
You the great toe of this assembly
FIRST CITIZEN I the great toe Why the great toe
Of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost
Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle
The one side must have bale
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
Hail noble Marcius
That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
Make yourselves scabs
FIRST CITIZEN We have ever your good word
MARCIUS He that will give good words to thee will flatter
Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs
That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you
The other makes you proud He that trusts to you
Where he should find you lions finds you hares
Where foxes geese you are no surer no
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice
Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness
Deserves your hate and your affections are
Which would increase his evil He that depends
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye
With every minute you do change a mind
And call him noble that was now your hate
That in these several places of the city
You cry against the noble Senate who
Under the gods keep you in awe which else
MENENIUS For corn at their own rates whereof they say
Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out
Conjectural marriages making parties strong
And feebling such as stand not in their liking
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth
As I could pick my lance
MENENIUS Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
For though abundantly they lack discretion
Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you
What says the other troop
That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
Corn for the rich men only With these shreds
To break the heart of generosity
Shouting their emulation
MENENIUS What is granted them
MARCIUS Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
MENENIUS This is strange
MARCIUS Go get you home you fragments
Enter a MESSENGER hastily
MESSENGER The news is sir the Volsces are in arms
Our musty superfluity See our best elders
Enter COMINIUS TITUS LARTIUS with other SENATORS
JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS
The Volsces are in arms
MARCIUS They have a leader
I sin in envying his nobility
And were I anything but what I am
I would wish me only he
COMINIUS You have fought together
Only my wars with him He is a lion
That I am proud to hunt
FIRST SENATOR Then worthy Marcius
Attend upon Cominius to these wars
COMINIUS It is your former promise
MARCIUS Sir it is
And I am constant Titus Lartius thou
LARTIUS No Caius Marcius
Ere stay behind this business
MENENIUS O true bred
Our greatest friends attend us
Right worthy you priority
COMINIUS Noble Marcius
MARCIUS Nay let them follow
The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither
To gnaw their garners Worshipful mutineers
Your valour puts well forth pray follow
Ciitzens steal away Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS
SICINIUS Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius
BRUTUS He has no equal
SICINIUS Nay but his taunts
SICINIUS Bemock the modest moon
BRUTUS The present wars devour him He is grown
Too proud to be so valiant
SICINIUS Such a nature
Tickled with good success disdains the shadow
Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder
His insolence can brook to be commanded
Under Cominius
A place below the first for what miscarries
SICINIUS Besides if things go well
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
Of his demerits rob Cominius
BRUTUS Come
To Marcius shall be honours though indeed
In aught he merit not
How the dispatch is made and in what fashion
More than his singularity he goes
Upon this present action
SCENE II
Corioli The Senate House
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with SENATORS of Corioli
FIRST SENATOR So your opinion is Aufidius
And know how we proceed
AUFIDIUS Is it not yours
What ever have been thought on in this state
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
I have the letter hereyes here it is
Whether for east or west The dearth is great
Cominius Marcius your old enemy
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you
And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman
These three lead on this preparation
We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
To answer us
AUFIDIUS Nor did you think it folly
They needs must show themselves which in the hatching
To take in many towns ere almost Rome
Should know we were afoot
SECOND SENATOR Noble Aufidius
Take your commission hie you to your bands
Let us alone to guard Corioli
AUFIDIUS O doubt not that
I speak from certainties Nay more
Some parcels of their power are forth already
And only hitherward I leave your honours
If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet
Till one can do no more
ALL The gods assist you
AUFIDIUS And keep your honours safe
FIRST SENATOR Farewell
SECOND SENATOR Farewell
ALL Farewell                                           Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA mother and wife to MARCIUS
they set them down on two low stools and sew
VOLUMNIA I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more
comfortable sort If my son were my husband I should freelier
rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the
embracements of his bed where he would show most love When yet
he was to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he
now in first seeing he had proved himself a man
VIRGILIA But had he died in the business madam how then
VOLUMNIA Then his good report should have been my son I therein
would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen
sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my
good Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country
than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
Enter a GENTLEWOMAN
GENTLEWOMAN Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you
VIRGILIA Beseech you give me leave to retire myself
VOLUMNIA Indeed you shall not
As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him
Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus
Or all or lose his hire
VIRGILIA His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood
VOLUMNIA Away you fool It more becomes a man
Than gilt his trophy The breasts of Hecuba
At Grecian sword contemning Tell Valeria
We are fit to bid her welcome              Exit GENTLEWOMAN
VIRGILIA Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius
And tread upon his neck
VALERIA My ladies both good day to you
VOLUMNIA Sweet madam
VIRGILIA I am glad to see your ladyship
VALERIA How do you both You are manifest housekeepers What are
you sewing here A fine spot in good faith How does your little
son
VIRGILIA I thank your ladyship well good madam
VOLUMNIA He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look
upon his schoolmaster
after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go
again and after it again and over and over he comes and up
VIRGILIA A crack madam
VALERIA Come lay aside your stitchery I must have you play the
idle huswife with me this afternoon
VIRGILIA No good madam I will not out of doors
VALERIA Not out of doors
VOLUMNIA She shall she shall
till my lord return from the wars
VALERIA Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably come you
must go visit the good lady that lies in
VIRGILIA I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my
prayers but I cannot go thither
VOLUMNIA Why I pray you
VALERIA You would be another Penelope yet they say all the yarn
Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you
might leave pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us
VIRGILIA No good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth
of your husband
VIRGILIA O good madam there can be none yet
VALERIA Verily I do not jest with you there came news from him
last night
VIRGILIA Indeed madam
is the Volsces have an army forth against whom Cominius the
general is gone with one part of our Roman power Your lord and
Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they
nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true
on mine honour and so I pray go with us
VIRGILIA Give me excuse good madam I will obey you in everything
hereafter
VOLUMNIA Let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease
our better mirth
VALERIA In troth I think she would Fare you well then Come
door and go along with us
VIRGILIA No at a word madam indeed I must not I wish you much
mirth
VALERIA Well then farewell                           Exeunt
SCENE IV
Before Corioli
Enter MARCIUS TITUS LARTIUS with drum and colours
with CAPTAINS and soldiers To them a MESSENGER
LARTIUS Agreed
MARCIUS Say has our general met the enemy
MESSENGER They lie in view but have not spoke as yet
LARTIUS So the good horse is mine
For half a hundred years Summon the town
MARCIUS How far off lie these armies
MESSENGER Within this mile and half
Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work
That we with smoking swords may march from hence
To help our fielded friends Come blow thy blast
They sound a parley Enter two SENATORS with others
on the walls of Corioli
Tullus Aufidius is he within your walls
FIRST SENATOR No nor a man that fears you less than he
Rather than they shall pound us up our gates
There is Aufidius List what work he makes
Amongst your cloven army
MARCIUS O they are at it
LARTIUS Their noise be our instruction Ladders ho
Enter the army of the Volsces
MARCIUS They fear us not but issue forth their city
Now put your shields before your hearts and fight
With hearts more proof than shields Advance brave Titus
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
Which makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows
And he shall feel mine edge
Alarum The Romans are beat back to their trenches
MARCIUS All the contagion of the south light on you
Farther than seen and one infect another
Against the wind a mile You souls of geese
That bear the shapes of men how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell
All hurt behind Backs red and faces pale
With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home
As they us to our trenches Follow me
Another alarum The Volsces fly and MARCIUS follows
them to the gates
So now the gates are ope now prove good seconds
Not for the fliers Mark me and do the like
FIRST SOLDIER See they have shut him in
LARTIUS What is become of Marcius
ALL Slain sir doubtless
FIRST SOLDIER Following the fliers at the very heels
With them he enters who upon the sudden
To answer all the city
LARTIUS O noble fellow
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
A carbuncle entire as big as thou art
Were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier
Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
Were feverous and did tremble
FIRST SOLDIER Look sir
SCENE V
Within Corioli A street
Enter certain Romans with spoils
FIRST ROMAN This will I carry to Rome
SECOND ROMAN And I this
Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS With a trumpeter
MARCIUS See here these movers that do prize their hours
Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
Bury with those that wore them these base slaves
Ere yet the fight be done pack up Down with them
Exeunt pillagers
And hark what noise the general makes To him
Piercing our Romans then valiant Titus take
Convenient numbers to make good the city
Whilst I with those that have the spirit will haste
To help Cominius
Thy exercise hath been too violent
For a second course of fight
MARCIUS Sir praise me not
The blood I drop is rather physical
Than dangerous to me To Aufidius thus
I will appear and fight
LARTIUS Now the fair goddess Fortune
Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
Prosperity be thy page
MARCIUS Thy friend no less
Than those she placeth highest So farewell
LARTIUS Thou worthiest Marcius                  Exit MARCIUS
Where they shall know our mind Away                 Exeunt
SCENE VI
Near the camp of COMINIUS
Enter COMINIUS as it were in retire with soldiers
COMINIUS Breathe you my friends Well fought we are come off
Like Romans neither foolish in our stands
Nor cowardly in retire Believe me sirs
By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
The charges of our friends The Roman gods
Lead their successes as we wish our own
May give you thankful sacrifice
Enter A MESSENGER
Thy news
MESSENGER The citizens of Corioli have issued
And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle
I saw our party to their trenches driven
And then I came away
MESSENGER Above an hour my lord
How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
And bring thy news so late
MESSENGER Spies of the Volsces
Three or four miles about else had I sir
Half an hour since brought my report
Enter MARCIUS
He has the stamp of Marcius and I have
MARCIUS Come I too late
COMINIUS The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
From every meaner man
MARCIUS Come I too late
COMINIUS Ay if you come not in the blood of others
But mantled in your own
MARCIUS O let me clip ye
As merry as when our nuptial day was done
COMINIUS Flower of warriors
MARCIUS As with a man busied about decrees
Condemning some to death and some to exile
Holding Corioli in the name of Rome
Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
To let him slip at will
COMINIUS Where is that slave
Which told me they had beat you to your trenches
Where is he Call him hither
MARCIUS Let him alone
He did inform the truth But for our gentlemen
From rascals worse than they
MARCIUS Will the time serve to tell I do not think
If not why cease you till you are so
COMINIUS Marcius
We have at disadvantage fought and did
Retire to win our purpose
MARCIUS How lies their battle Know you on which side
COMINIUS As I guess Marcius
Their very heart of hope
MARCIUS I do beseech you
By all the battles wherein we have fought
We have made to endure friends that you directly
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates
And that you not delay the present but
We prove this very hour
COMINIUS Though I could wish
You were conducted to a gentle bath
And balms applied to you yet dare I never
Deny your asking take your choice of those
That best can aid your action
MARCIUS Those are they
Lesser his person than an ill report
If any think brave death outweighs bad life
Let him alone or so many so minded
Wave thus to express his disposition
O me alone Make you a sword of me
If these shows be not outward which of you
But is four Volsces None of you but is
Able to bear against the great Aufidius
A shield as hard as his A certain number
Though thanks to all must I select from all the rest
Shall bear the business in some other fight
And four shall quickly draw out my command
COMINIUS March on my fellows
Make good this ostentation and you shall
Divide in all with us                                Exeunt
SCENE VII
The gates of Corioli
TITUS LARTIUS having set a guard upon Corioli going with drum and trumpet
toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS enters with a LIEUTENANT other soldiers
and a scout
LARTIUS So let the ports be guarded keep your duties
As I have set them down If I do send dispatch
Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve
For a short holding If we lose the field
We cannot keep the town
LIEUTENANT Fear not our care sir
SCENE VIII
A field of battle between the Roman and the Volscian camps
Alarum as in battle Enter MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS at several doors
AUFIDIUS We hate alike
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy Fix thy foot
And the gods doom him after
AUFIDIUS If I fly Marcius
Halloa me like a hare
MARCIUS Within these three hours Tullus
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls
AUFIDIUS Wert thou the Hector
Thou shouldst not scape me here
Here they fight and certain Volsces come in the aid
of AUFIDIUS MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
breathless
In your condemned seconds                            Exeunt
SCENE IX
The Roman camp
Flourish Alarum A retreat is sounded Enter at one door
COMINIUS with the Romans at another door MARCIUS with his arm in a scarf
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug
That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
Enter TITUS LARTIUS with his power from the pursuit
LARTIUS O General
Here is the steed we the caparison
MARCIUS Pray now no more my mother
Who has a charter to extol her blood
When she does praise me grieves me I have done
He that has but effected his good will
COMINIUS You shall not be
The grave of your deserving Rome must know
Worse than a theft no less than a traducement
To hide your doings and to silence that
Would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you
In sign of what you are not to reward
What you have done before our army hear me
MARCIUS I have some wounds upon me and they smart
COMINIUS Should they not
Before the common distribution at
Your only choice
MARCIUS I thank you General
But cannot make my heart consent to take
A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it
And stand upon my common part with those
That have beheld the doing
cast up their caps and lances COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare
May these same instruments which you profane
Never sound more When drums and trumpets shall
In acclamations hyperbolical
COMINIUS Too modest are you
More cruel to your good report than grateful
To us that give you truly By your patience
Then reason safely with you Therefore be it known
As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius
My noble steed known to the camp I give him
With all his trim belonging and from this time
For what he did before Corioli can him
Caius Marcius Coriolanus
ALL Caius Marcius Coriolanus
CORIOLANUS I will go wash
And when my face is fair you shall perceive
Whether I blush or no Howbeit I thank you
I mean to stride your steed and at all times
To undercrest your good addition
COMINIUS So to our tent
Where ere we do repose us we will write
To Rome of our success You Titus Lartius
Must to Corioli back Send us to Rome
The best with whom we may articulate
For their own good and ours
LARTIUS I shall my lord
CORIOLANUS The gods begin to mock me I that now
Of my Lord General
CORIOLANUS I sometime lay here in Corioli
He cried to me I saw him prisoner
But then Aufidius was within my view
To give my poor host freedom
Were he the butcher of my son he should
Be free as is the wind Deliver him Titus
LARTIUS Marcius his name
CORIOLANUS By Jupiter forgot
Have we no wine here
COMINIUS Go we to our tent
SCENE X
The camp of the Volsces
A flourish Cornets Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS bloody with two or three soldiers
AUFIDIUS Condition
I would I were a Roman for I cannot
Being a Volsce be that I am Condition
What good condition can a treaty find
I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me
And wouldst do so I think should we encounter
I thought to crush him in an equal force
Or wrath or craft may get him
Shall fly out of itself Nor sleep nor sanctuary
Being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
Embarquements all of fury shall lift up
My hate to Marcius Where I find him were it
Against the hospitable canon would I
Be hostages for Rome
FIRST SOLDIER Will not you go
How the world goes that to the pace of it
I may spur on my journey
FIRST SOLDIER I shall sir                            Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
Rome A public place
Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people SICINIUS and BRUTUS
MENENIUS The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
BRUTUS Good or bad
MENENIUS Not according to the prayer of the people for they love
not Marcius
SICINIUS Nature teaches beasts to know their friends
MENENIUS Pray you who does the wolf love
SICINIUS The lamb
MENENIUS Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble Marcius
old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you
BOTH TRIBUNES Well sir
MENENIUS In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not
in abundance
SICINIUS Especially in pride
BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting
MENENIUS This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured
BOTH TRIBUNES Well well sir well
occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your
least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame
Marcius for being proud
BRUTUS We do it not alone sir
MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are
many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your
pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your
necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O
that you could
BOTH TRIBUNES What then sir
MENENIUS Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
SICINIUS Menenius you are known well enough too
MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves
be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the
morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath
make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have
the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to
bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie
deadly that tell you you have good faces If you see this in the
map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too
What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this
character if I be known well enough too
BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough
MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor any thing You are
to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter
colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag
the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All
the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties
knaves You are a pair of strange ones
BRUTUS Come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber
for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol
MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak
best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your
beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to
cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion
would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you
Enter VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA and VALERIA
VOLUMNIA Honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches for the
MENENIUS Ha Marcius coming home
VOLUMNIA Ay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous
approbation
MENENIUS Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo
Marcius coming home
health in which time I will make a lip at the physician The
most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and to
not wounded He was wont to come home wounded
VIRGILIA O no no no
MENENIUS So do I too if it be not too much Brings a victory in
his pocket The wounds become him
the oaken garland
VOLUMNIA Titus Lartius writes they fought together but Aufidius
got off
letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name
of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds
doubly
MENENIUS Wondrous Ay I warrant you and not without his true
purchasing
VIRGILIA The gods grant them true
VOLUMNIA True pow waw
home he has more cause to be proud Where is he wounded
cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place
know
upon him
VOLUMNIA These are the ushers of Marcius Before him he carries
noise and behind him he leaves tears
A sennet Trumpets sound Enter COMINIUS the
GENERAL and TITUS LARTIUS between them
CAPTAINS and soldiers and a HERALD
HERALD Know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight
Within Corioli gates where he hath won
With fame a name to Caius Marcius these
In honour follows Coriolanus
ALL Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus
CORIOLANUS No more of this it does offend my heart
Pray now no more
COMINIUS Look sir your mother
CORIOLANUS O
VOLUMNIA Nay my good soldier up
My gentle Marcius worthy Caius and
What is it Coriolanus must I can thee
But O thy wife
CORIOLANUS My gracious silence hail
Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear
And mothers that lack sons
MENENIUS Now the gods crown thee
pardon
VOLUMNIA I know not where to turn
O welcome home And welcome General
MENENIUS A hundred thousand welcomes I could weep
And I could laugh I am light and heavy Welcome
That is not glad to see thee You are three
That Rome should dote on yet by the faith of men
We have some old crab trees here at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish Yet welcome warriors
We call a nettle but a nettle and
The faults of fools but folly
COMINIUS Ever right
CORIOLANUS Menenius ever ever
HERALD Give way there and go on
Ere in our own house I do shade my head
The good patricians must be visited
But with them change of honours
VOLUMNIA I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy only
Our Rome will cast upon thee
CORIOLANUS Know good mother
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs
COMINIUS On to the Capitol
BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward
BRUTUS All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins
With variable complexions all agreeing
Do press among the popular throngs and puff
Commit the war of white and damask in
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slily crept into his human powers
And gave him graceful posture
SICINIUS On the sudden
I warrant him consul
BRUTUS Then our office may
During his power go sleep
From where he should begin and end but will
Lose those he hath won
SICINIUS Doubt not
The commoners for whom we stand but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honours which
That he will give them make I as little question
BRUTUS I heard him swear
Were he to stand for consul never would he
The napless vesture of humility
Nor showing as the manner is his wounds
BRUTUS It was his word O he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles
SICINIUS I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution
SICINIUS It shall be to him then as our good wills
A sure destruction
BRUTUS So it must fall out
To him or our authorities For an end
We must suggest the people in what hatred
Dispropertied their freedoms holding them
In human action and capacity
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens and sore blows
For sinking under them
SICINIUS This as you say suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
Shall darken him for ever
Enter A MESSENGER
That Marcius shall be consul
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
The blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts
I never saw the like
But hearts for the event
SICINIUS Have with you                                Exeunt
SCENE II
Rome The Capitol
Enter two OFFICERS to lay cushions as it were in the Capitol
FIRST OFFICER Come come they are almost here How many stand for
consulships
Coriolanus will carry it
loves not the common people
SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have
that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they
love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground
Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or
hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly
FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no
but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can
render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover
him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and
flatter them for their love
SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been
supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further
deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but
he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in
their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess
so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise
were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof
and rebuke from every car that heard it
are coming
A sennet Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES
OF THE PEOPLE LICTORS before them CORIOLANUS
MENENIUS COMINIUS the Consul SICINIUS and
BRUTUS take their places by themselves
CORIOLANUS stands
To send for Titus Lartius it remains
To gratify his noble service that
Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you
Most reverend and grave elders to desire
The present consul and last general
By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom
We met here both to thank and to remember
FIRST SENATOR Speak good Cominius
Leave nothing out for length and make us think
We do request your kindest ears and after
Your loving motion toward the common body
To yield what passes here
SICINIUS We are convented
Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
Inclinable to honour and advance
The theme of our assembly
BRUTUS Which the rather
A kinder value of the people than
I would you rather had been silent Please you
To hear Cominius speak
BRUTUS Most willingly
But yet my caution was more pertinent
Than the rebuke you give it
MENENIUS He loves your people
But tie him not to be their bedfellow
Worthy Cominius speak
Nay keep your place
FIRST SENATOR Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear
What you have nobly done
I had rather have my wounds to heal again
Than hear say how I got them
BRUTUS Sir I hope
CORIOLANUS No sir yet oft
When blows have made me stay I fled from words
MENENIUS Pray now sit down
When the alarum were struck than idly sit
MENENIUS Masters of the people
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
COMINIUS I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus
That valour is the chiefest virtue and
Most dignifies the haver If it be
The man I speak of cannot in the world
When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought
Beyond the mark of others our then Dictator
Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him he bestrid
When he might act the woman in the scene
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
Before and in Corioli let me say
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport as weeds before
Where it did mark it took from face to foot
He was a thing of blood whose every motion
With shunless destiny aidless came off
His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
And to the battle came he where he did
Both field and city ours he never stood
To ease his breast with panting
MENENIUS Worthy man
FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours
Which we devise him
The common muck of the world He covets less
Than misery itself would give rewards
His deeds with doing them and is content
To spend the time to end it
FIRST SENATOR Call Coriolanus
OFFICER He doth appear
To make thee consul
CORIOLANUS I do owe them still
My life and services
MENENIUS It then remains
That you do speak to the people
CORIOLANUS I do beseech you
Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
That I may pass this doing
SICINIUS Sir the people
Must have their voices neither will they bate
One jot of ceremony
Pray you go fit you to the custom and
Take to you as your predecessors have
Your honour with your form
CORIOLANUS It is a part
That I shall blush in acting and might well
Be taken from the people
BRUTUS Mark you that
Of their breath only
We recommend to you Tribunes of the People
Our purpose to them and to our noble consul
Wish we all joy and honour
SENATORS To Coriolanus come all joy and honour
BRUTUS You see how he intends to use the people
As if he did contemn what he requested
Should be in them to give
I know they do attend us                             Exeunt
SCENE III
Rome The Forum
Enter seven or eight citizens
FIRST CITIZEN Once if he do require our voices we ought not to
deny him
SECOND CITIZEN We may sir if we will
THIRD CITIZEN We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds
and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those
wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we
must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a
monster of the multitude of the which we being members should
bring ourselves to be monstrous members
FIRST CITIZEN And to make us no better thought of a little help
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck
are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our
were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north
south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to
SECOND CITIZEN Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would
fly
SECOND CITIZEN Why that way
THIRD CITIZEN To lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return for
SECOND CITIZEN YOU are never without your tricks you may you
may
no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would
incline to the people there was never a worthier man
Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility
with MENENIUS
Here he comes and in the gown of humility Mark his behaviour
We are not to stay all together but to come by him where he
requests by particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own tongues
ALL Content content                         Exeunt citizens
MENENIUS O sir you are not right have you not known
CORIOLANUS What must I say
MENENIUS O me the gods
You must not speak of that You must desire them
To think upon you
I would they would forget me like the virtues
In wholesome manner                                    Exit
CORIOLANUS Bid them wash their faces
And keep their teeth clean So here comes a brace
You know the cause sir of my standing here
CORIOLANUS Mine own desert
SECOND CITIZEN Your own desert
CORIOLANUS Ay not mine own desire
THIRD CITIZEN How not your own desire
with begging
THIRD CITIZEN YOU MUST think if we give you anything we hope to
gain by you
FIRST CITIZEN The price is to ask it kindly
you which shall be yours in private Your good voice sir what
say you
I have your alms Adieu
THIRD CITIZEN But this is something odd
Exeunt the three citizens
CORIOLANUS Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown
FOURTH CITIZEN You have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly
CORIOLANUS Your enigma
FOURTH CITIZEN You have been a scourge to her enemies you have
been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common
people
CORIOLANUS You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn
condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their
choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That
is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man
and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I
may be consul
FIFTH CITIZEN We hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily
FOURTH CITIZEN You have received many wounds for your country
CORIOLANUS I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther
BOTH CITIZENS The gods give you joy sir heartily
Exeunt citizens
CORIOLANUS Most sweet voices
Better it is to die better to starve
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve
Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here
To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear
The dust on antique time would lie unswept
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus I am half through
The one part suffered the other will I do
Here come moe voices
Your voices For your voices I have fought
Of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of for your voices have
Done many things some less some more Your voices
Indeed I would be consul
SIXTH CITIZEN He has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
SEVENTH CITIZEN Therefore let him be consul The gods give him
joy and make him good friend to the people
ALL Amen amen God save thee noble consul
Exeunt citizens
CORIOLANUS Worthy voices
MENENIUS You have stood your limitation and the tribunes
Anon do meet the Senate
CORIOLANUS Is this done
To meet anon upon your approbation
CORIOLANUS Where At the Senate House
SICINIUS There Coriolanus
CORIOLANUS May I change these garments
SICINIUS You may sir
BRUTUS We stay here for the people
SICINIUS Fare you well
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
He has it now and by his looks methinks
BRUTUS With a proud heart he wore
His humble weeds Will you dismiss the people
SICINIUS How now my masters Have you chose this man
FIRST CITIZEN He has our voices sir
BRUTUS We pray the gods he may deserve your loves
SECOND CITIZEN Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice
THIRD CITIZEN Certainly
He flouted us downright
SECOND CITIZEN Not one amongst us save yourself but says
SICINIUS Why so he did I am sure
THIRD CITIZEN He said he had wounds which he could show in
private
And with his hat thus waving it in scorn
But by your voices will not so permit me
Your most sweet voices Now you have left your voices
Or seeing it of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices
But was a petty servant to the state
He was your enemy ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
If he should still malignantly remain
Be curses to yourselves You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love
Standing your friendly lord
SICINIUS Thus to have said
Either his gracious promise which you might
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught So putting him to rage
BRUTUS Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you
When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies
No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment
SICINIUS Have you
Ere now denied the asker and now again
Of him that did not ask but mock bestow
SECOND CITIZENS And will deny him
FIRST CITIZEN I twice five hundred and their friends to piece
BRUTUS Get you hence instantly and tell those friends
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so
SICINIUS Let them assemble
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election Enforce his pride
And his old hate unto you besides forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed
Thinking upon his services took from you
Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you
BRUTUS Lay
No impediment between but that you must
Cast your election on him
SICINIUS Say you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections and that your minds
Than what you should made you against the grain
To voice him consul Lay the fault on us
BRUTUS Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you
How youngly he began to serve his country
Who after great Hostilius here was king
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were
That our best water brought by conduits hither
And Censorinus nobly named so
Twice being by the people chosen censor
Was his great ancestor
SICINIUS One thus descended
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place we did commend
To your remembrances but you have found
Scaling his present bearing with his past
Your sudden approbation
And presently when you have drawn your number
CITIZENS will will so almost all
Repent in their election                   Exeunt plebeians
BRUTUS Let them go on
This mutiny were better put in hazard
Than stay past doubt for greater
If as his nature is he fall in rage
With their refusal both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger
Which we have goaded onward                          Exeunt
ACT III SCENE I
Rome A street
Cornets Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS all the GENTRY COMINIUS
TITUS LARTIUS and other SENATORS
CORIOLANUS Tullus Aufidius then had made new head
Our swifter composition
CORIOLANUS So then the Volsces stand but as at first
Ready when time shall prompt them to make road
COMINIUS They are worn Lord Consul so
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again
CORIOLANUS Saw you Aufidius
LARTIUS On safeguard he came to me and did curse
Against the Volsces for they had so vilely
CORIOLANUS Spoke he of me
LARTIUS He did my lord
CORIOLANUS How What
LARTIUS How often he had met you sword to sword
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution so he might
CORIOLANUS At Antium lives he
LARTIUS At Antium
CORIOLANUS I wish I had a cause to seek him there
To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
Behold these are the tribunes of the people
For they do prank them in authority
Against all noble sufferance
SICINIUS Pass no further
CORIOLANUS Ha What is that
CORIOLANUS What makes this change
MENENIUS The matter
BRUTUS Cominius no
SICINIUS Stop
Or all will fall in broil
CORIOLANUS Are these your herd
Must these have voices that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices
You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
Have you not set them on
MENENIUS Be calm be calm
To curb the will of the nobility
CORIOLANUS Why this was known before
BRUTUS Not to them all
BRUTUS How I inform them
COMINIUS You are like to do such business
BRUTUS Not unlike
Each way to better yours
CORIOLANUS Why then should I be consul By yond clouds
Let me deserve so ill as you and make me
Your fellow tribune
SICINIUS You show too much of that
For which the people stir if you will pass
To where you are bound you must enquire your way
Which you are out of with a gentler spirit
Or never be so noble as a consul
Nor yoke with him for tribune
Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus
CORIOLANUS Tell me of corn
MENENIUS Not now not now
FIRST SENATOR Not in this heat sir now
CORIOLANUS Now as I live I will
My nobler friends I crave their pardons
Regard me as I do not flatter and
Therein behold themselves I say again
The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
Who lack not virtue no nor power but that
Which they have given to beggars
MENENIUS Well no more
FIRST SENATOR No more words we beseech you
CORIOLANUS How no more
As for my country I have shed my blood
Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles
Which we disdain should tetter us yet sought
The very way to catch them
As if you were a god to punish not
A man of their infirmity
MENENIUS What what his choler
CORIOLANUS Choler
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep
SICINIUS It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is
Not poison any further
CORIOLANUS Shall remain
Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you
O good but most unwise patricians Why
You grave but reckless senators have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer
And make your channel his If he have power
Then vail your ignorance if none awake
Be not as common fools if you are not
Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians
If they be senators and they are no less
Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate
It makes the consuls base and my soul aches
To know when two authorities are up
Neither supreme how soon confusion
CORIOLANUS Whoever gave that counsel to give forth
MENENIUS Well well no more of that
The ruin of the state
BRUTUS Why shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice
More worthier than their voices They know the corn
They would not thread the gates This kind of service
Which they have often made against the Senate
All cause unborn could never be the native
Of our so frank donation Well what then
How shall this bosom multiplied digest
We are the greater poll and in true fear
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears which will in time
The crows to peck the eagles
MENENIUS Come enough
BRUTUS Enough with over measure
CORIOLANUS No take more
What may be sworn by both divine and human
Seal what I end withal This double worship
Where one part does disdain with cause the other
Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Real necessities and give way the while
You that will be less fearful than discreet
That love the fundamental part of state
A noble life before a long and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
The multitudinous tongue let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison Your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Not having the power to do the good it would
BRUTUS Has said enough
SICINIUS Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
As traitors do
What should the people do with these bald tribunes
On whom depending their obedience fails
To the greater bench In a rebellion
Then were they chosen in a better hour
Let what is meet be said it must be meet
BRUTUS Manifest treason
SICINIUS This a consul No
BRUTUS The aediles ho
Enter an AEDILE
Let him be apprehended
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator
And follow to thine answer
CORIOLANUS Hence old goat
CORIOLANUS Hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments
SICINIUS Help ye citizens
Enter a rabble of plebeians with the AEDILES
MENENIUS On both sides more respect
BRUTUS Seize him aediles
PLEBEIANS Down with him down with him
SECOND SENATOR Weapons weapons weapons
ALL Tribunes patricians citizens What ho Sicinius
Brutus Coriolanus Citizens
PATRICIANS Peace peace peace stay hold peace
MENENIUS What is about to be I am out of breath
Speak good Sicinius
SICINIUS Hear me people peace
SICINIUS You are at point to lose your liberties
Marcius would have all from you Marcius
MENENIUS Fie fie fie
This is the way to kindle not to quench
FIRST SENATOR To unbuild the city and to lay all flat
SICINIUS What is the city but the people
PLEBEIANS True
The people are the city
PLEBEIANS You so remain
MENENIUS And so are like to do
COMINIUS That is the way to lay the city flat
To bring the roof to the foundation
And bury all which yet distinctly ranges
In heaps and piles of ruin
SICINIUS This deserves death
BRUTUS Or let us stand to our authority
Or let us lose it We do here pronounce
We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy
Of present death
SICINIUS Therefore lay hold of him
Into destruction cast him
BRUTUS AEdiles seize him
PLEBEIANS Yield Marcius yield
MENENIUS Hear me one word beseech you Tribunes
Hear me but a word
AEDILES Peace peace
Thus violently redress
BRUTUS Sir those cold ways
That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
Where the disease is violent Lay hands upon him
And bear him to the rock
Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
MENENIUS Down with that sword Tribunes withdraw awhile
BRUTUS Lay hands upon him
MENENIUS Help Marcius help
You that be noble help him young and old
PLEBEIANS Down with him down with him
MENENIUS Go get you to your house be gone away
All will be nought else
SECOND SENATOR Get you gone
CORIOLANUS Stand fast
We have as many friends as enemies
MENENIUS Shall it be put to that
FIRST SENATOR The gods forbid
I prithee noble friend home to thy house
Leave us to cure this cause
You cannot tent yourself be gone beseech you
COMINIUS Come sir along with us
CORIOLANUS I would they were barbarians as they are
MENENIUS Be gone
Put not your worthy rage into your tongue
One time will owe another
CORIOLANUS On fair ground
I could beat forty of them
MENENIUS I could myself
Against a falling fabric Will you hence
Before the tag return whose rage doth rend
MENENIUS Pray you be gone
With cloth of any colour
COMINIUS Nay come away
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and COMINIUS with others
MENENIUS His nature is too noble for the world
He would not flatter Neptune for his trident
What his breast forges that his tongue must vent
And being angry does forget that ever
MENENIUS I would they were in Tiber
SICINIUS Where is this viper
That would depopulate the city and
Be every man himself
SICINIUS He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
With rigorous hands he hath resisted law
And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
Than the severity of the public power
Which he so sets at nought
FIRST CITIZEN He shall well know
And we their hands
SICINIUS Peace
MENENIUS Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
With modest warrant
Have holp to make this rescue
MENENIUS Hear me speak
So can I name his faults
SICINIUS Consul What consul
MENENIUS The consul Coriolanus
BRUTUS He consul
PLEBEIANS No no no no no
I may be heard I would crave a word or two
The which shall turn you to no further harm
Than so much loss of time
SICINIUS Speak briefly then
For we are peremptory to dispatch
This viperous traitor to eject him hence
Were but one danger and to keep him here
Our certain death therefore it is decreed
MENENIUS Now the good gods forbid
That our renowned Rome whose gratitude
Should now eat up her own
Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath
And what is left to lose it by his country
SICINIUS This is clean kam
BRUTUS Merely awry When he did love his country
SICINIUS The service of the foot
For what before it was
Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence
Lest his infection being of catching nature
Spread further
MENENIUS One word more one word
And sack great Rome with Romans
SICINIUS What do ye talk
Our aediles smote ourselves resisted Come
In bolted language meal and bran together
He throws without distinction Give me leave
Where he shall answer by a lawful form
In peace to his utmost peril
FIRST SENATOR Noble Tribunes
It is the humane way the other course
Will prove too bloody and the end of it
Unknown to the beginning
SICINIUS Noble Menenius
Masters lay down your weapons
BRUTUS Go not home
In our first way
Or what is worst will follow
SCENE II
Rome The house of CORIOLANUS
Enter CORIOLANUS with NOBLES
CORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears present me
Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock
That the precipitation might down stretch
Below the beam of sight yet will I still
Be thus to them
FIRST PATRICIAN You do the nobler
CORIOLANUS I muse my mother
Does not approve me further who was wont
To call them woollen vassals things created
To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
In congregations to yawn be still and wonder
When one but of my ordinance stood up
To speak of peace or war
Enter VOLUMNIA
I talk of you
Why did you wish me milder Would you have me
False to my nature Rather say I play
The man I am
VOLUMNIA O sir sir sir
I would have had you put your power well on
Before you had worn it out
CORIOLANUS Let go
VOLUMNIA You might have been enough the man you are
With striving less to be so lesser had been
The thwartings of your dispositions if
CORIOLANUS Let them hang
VOLUMNIA Ay and burn too
Enter MENENIUS with the SENATORS
MENENIUS Come come you have been too rough something too rough
You must return and mend it
Unless by not so doing our good city
Cleave in the midst and perish
I have a heart as little apt as yours
But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
To better vantage
MENENIUS Well said noble woman
For the whole state I would put mine armour on
Which I can scarcely bear
CORIOLANUS What must I do
CORIOLANUS Well what then what then
MENENIUS Repent what you have spoke
CORIOLANUS For them I cannot do it to the gods
VOLUMNIA You are too absolute
Though therein you can never be too noble
But when extremities speak I have heard you say
That they combine not there
CORIOLANUS Tush tush
MENENIUS A good demand
VOLUMNIA If it be honour in your wars to seem
The same you are not which for your best ends
You adopt your policy how is it less or worse
That it shall hold companionship in peace
With honour as in war since that to both
It stands in like request
CORIOLANUS Why force you this
VOLUMNIA Because that now it lies you on to speak
But with such words that are but roted in
Your tongue though but bastards and syllables
Now this no more dishonours you at all
Than to take in a town with gentle words
Which else would put you to your fortune and
The hazard of much blood
I would dissemble with my nature where
I should do so in honour I am in this
Your wife your son these senators the nobles
And you will rather show our general louts
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
Of what that want might ruin
MENENIUS Noble lady
Come go with us speak fair you may salve so
Not what is dangerous present but the los
Of what is past
VOLUMNIA I prithee now My son
Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
Now humble as the ripest mulberry
That will not hold the handling Or say to them
Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim
In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
As thou hast power and person
MENENIUS This but done
Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
As words to little purpose
VOLUMNIA Prithee now
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
Than flatter him in a bower
Enter COMINIUS
Here is Cominius
You make strong party or defend yourself
MENENIUS Only fair speech
Can thereto frame his spirit
VOLUMNIA He must and will
Prithee now say you will and go about it
With my base tongue give to my noble heart
Yet were there but this single plot to lose
This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it
You have put me now to such a part which never
VOLUMNIA I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
My praises made thee first a soldier so
To have my praise for this perform a part
Thou hast not done before
Away my disposition and possess me
Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
That babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
A most inherent baseness
VOLUMNIA At thy choice then
To beg of thee it is my more dishonour
Than thou of them Come all to ruin Let
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death
With as big heart as thou Do as thou list
But owe thy pride thyself
CORIOLANUS Pray be content
Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going
Or never trust to what my tongue can do
VOLUMNIA Do your will                                   Exit
COMINIUS Away The tribunes do attend you Arm yourself
With accusations as I hear more strong
Than are upon you yet
Let them accuse me by invention I
Will answer in mine honour
MENENIUS Ay but mildly
SCENE III
Rome The Forum
Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
BRUTUS In this point charge him home that he affects
Tyrannical power If he evade us there
Enforce him with his envy to the people
And that the spoil got on the Antiates
Enter an AEDILE
What will he come
BRUTUS How accompanied
AEDILE With old Menenius and those senators
SICINIUS Have you a catalogue
SICINIUS Have you corrected them by tribes
AEDILE I have
SICINIUS Assemble presently the people hither
For death for fine or banishment then let them
Insisting on the old prerogative
AEDILE I shall inform them
BRUTUS And when such time they have begun to cry
Enforce the present execution
Of what we chance to sentence
AEDILE Very well
SICINIUS Make them be strong and ready for this hint
BRUTUS Go about it                               Exit AEDILE
Ever to conquer and to have his worth
With us to break his neck
Enter CORIOLANUS MENENIUS and COMINIUS with others
SICINIUS Well here he comes
MENENIUS Calmly I do beseech you
Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice
Throng our large temples with the shows of peace
And not our streets with war
FIRST SENATOR Amen amen
MENENIUS A noble wish
SICINIUS Draw near ye people
AEDILE List to your tribunes Audience peace I say
CORIOLANUS First hear me speak
BOTH TRIBUNES Well say Peace ho
Must all determine here
SICINIUS I do demand
Allow their officers and are content
To suffer lawful censure for such faults
CORIOLANUS I am content
MENENIUS Lo citizens he says he is content
The warlike service he has done consider think
Upon the wounds his body bears which show
CORIOLANUS Scratches with briers
Scars to move laughter only
MENENIUS Consider further
That when he speaks not like a citizen
You find him like a soldier do not take
His rougher accents for malicious sounds
But as I say such as become a soldier
Rather than envy you
COMINIUS Well well No more
CORIOLANUS What is the matter
You take it off again
SICINIUS Answer to us
Yourself into a power tyrannical
For which you are a traitor to the people
MENENIUS Nay temperately Your promise
Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune
Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say
As I do pray the gods
SICINIUS Mark you this people
SICINIUS Peace
We need not put new matter to his charge
What you have seen him do and heard him speak
Beating your officers cursing yourselves
Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
So criminal and in such capital kind
BRUTUS But since he hath
CORIOLANUS What do you prate of service
BRUTUS I talk of that that know it
CORIOLANUS You
MENENIUS Is this the promise that you made your mother
Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death
Vagabond exile flaying pent to linger
But with a grain a day I would not buy
Their mercy at the price of one fair word
Nor check my courage for what they can give
Envied against the people seeking means
To pluck away their power as now at last
Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
Of dreaded justice but on the ministers
And in the power of us the tribunes we
In peril of precipitation
From off the rock Tarpeian never more
I say it shall be so
PLEBEIANS It shall be so it shall be so Let him away
COMINIUS Let me speak
I have been consul and can show for Rome
More holy and profound than mine own life
And treasure of my loins Then if I would
SICINIUS We know your drift Speak what
As enemy to the people and his country
It shall be so
PLEBEIANS It shall be so it shall be so
CORIOLANUS YOU common cry of curs whose breath I hate
As the dead carcasses of unburied men
And here remain with your uncertainty
Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
Your enemies with nodding of their plumes
Fan you into despair Have the power still
To banish your defenders till at length
Making but reservation of yourselves
As most abated captives to some nation
That won you without blows Despising
For you the city thus I turn my back
There is a world elsewhere
Exeunt CORIOLANUS
COMINIUS MENENIUS with the other PATRICIANS
SICINIUS Go see him out at gates and follow him
Attend us through the city
The gods preserve our noble tribunes Come           Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
Rome Before a gate of the city
Enter CORIOLANUS VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA MENENIUS COMINIUS
with the young NOBILITY of Rome
CORIOLANUS Come leave your tears a brief farewell The beast
With many heads butts me away Nay mother
To say extremities was the trier of spirits
That common chances common men could bear
That when the sea was calm all boats alike
When most struck home being gentle wounded craves
With precepts that would make invincible
VIRGILIA O heavens O heavens
VOLUMNIA Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome
And occupations perish
CORIOLANUS What what what
Resume that spirit when you were wont to say
If you had been the wife of Hercules
Your husband so much sweat Cominius
Droop not adieu Farewell my wife my mother
And venomous to thine eyes My sometime General
I have seen thee stern and thou hast oft beheld
My hazards still have been your solace and
Like to a lonely dragon that his fen
Will or exceed the common or be caught
With cautelous baits and practice
VOLUMNIA My first son
Whither wilt thou go Take good Cominius
With thee awhile determine on some course
More than a wild exposture to each chance
VIRGILIA O the gods
Where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
And we of thee so if the time thrust forth
A cause for thy repeal we shall not send
And lose advantage which doth ever cool
CORIOLANUS Fare ye well
Thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
Come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
My friends of noble touch when I am forth
Bid me farewell and smile I pray you come
While I remain above the ground you shall
Hear from me still and never of me aught
But what is like me formerly
If I could shake off but one seven years
From these old arms and legs by the good gods
CORIOLANUS Give me thy hand
Come                                                 Exeunt

Stand in their ancient strength
BRUTUS Dismiss them home                         Exit AEDILE

Requite your love
MENENIUS Peace peace be not so loud
power
To say so to my husband
SICINIUS Are you mankind
VOLUMNIA Ay fool is that a shame Note but this fool
Was not a man my father Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words
SICINIUS O blessed heavens
VOLUMNIA Moe noble blows than ever thou wise words
Nay but thou shalt stay too I would my son
Were in Arabia and thy tribe before him
His good sword in his hand
SICINIUS What then
VIRGILIA What then
VOLUMNIA Bastards and all
Good man the wounds that he does bear for Rome
MENENIUS Come come peace
SICINIUS I would he had continued to his country
As he began and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made
BRUTUS I would he had
Cats that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know
VOLUMNIA Now pray sir get you gone
You have done a brave deed Ere you go hear this
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
SICINIUS Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits                Exeunt TRIBUNES
VOLUMNIA Take my prayers with you
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But once a day it would unclog my heart
MENENIUS You have told them home
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do
Exeunt VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA
MENENIUS Fie fie fie                                  Exit

ROMAN There hath been in Rome strange insurrections the people
against the senators patricians and nobles
VOLSCE Hath been Is it ended then Our state thinks not so they
are in a most warlike preparation and hope to come upon them in
the heat of their division
ROMAN The main blaze of it is past but a small thing would make
it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment
of that worthy Coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes
for ever This lies glowing I can tell you and is almost mature
for the violent breaking out
VOLSCE You will be welcome with this intelligence Nicanor
ROMAN The day serves well for them now I have heard it said the
with her husband Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in
these wars his great opposer Coriolanus being now in no
request of his country
VOLSCE He cannot choose I am most fortunate thus accidentally to
encounter you you have ended my business and I will merrily

glad of yours
ROMAN Well let us go together
SCENE IV

Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
In puny battle slay me
Enter A CITIZEN
Save you sir
CITIZEN And you

Where great Aufidius lies Is he in Antium
CITIZEN He is and feasts the nobles of the state
At his house this night
CORIOLANUS Which is his house beseech you
CITIZEN This here before you
CORIOLANUS Thank you sir farewell             Exit CITIZEN
O world thy slippery turns Friends now fast sworn
Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart
Whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise
Unseparable shall within this hour
On a dissension of a doit break out
To bitterest enmity so fellest foes
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
To take the one the other by some chance
Some trick not worth an egg shall grow dear friends
And interjoin their issues So with me
He does fair justice if he give me way
SCENE V
Music plays Enter A SERVINGMAN

fellows are asleep                                     Exit

head that he gives entrance to such companions Pray get you out
CORIOLANUS Away
SECOND SERVANT Away Get you away
Enter a third SERVINGMAN The first meets him
THIRD SERVANT What have you to do here fellow Pray you avoid the
house

THIRD SERVANT Under the canopy
CORIOLANUS Ay
CORIOLANUS No I serve not thy master
THIRD SERVANT How sir Do you meddle with my master
Enter AUFIDIUS with the second SERVINGMAN
AUFIDIUS Where is this fellow
disturbing the lords within
Think me for the man I am necessity
Commands me name myself
AUFIDIUS What is thy name
And harsh in sound to thine
Thou has a grim appearance and thy face
AUFIDIUS I know thee not Thy name
CORIOLANUS My name is Caius Marcius who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
My surname Coriolanus The painful service
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me Only that name remains
The cruelty and envy of the people
Permitted by our dastard nobles who
Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
Mistake me not to save my life for if
To be full quit of those my banishers
Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight
And make my misery serve thy turn So use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee for I will fight
Of all the under fiends But if so be
Longer to live most weary and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool
Since I have ever followed thee with hate
And cannot live but to thy shame unless
It be to do thee service
AUFIDIUS O Marcius Marcius
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things
Than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine
Mine arms about that body where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
The anvil of my sword and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour Know thou first
Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell the
We have a power on foot and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
Twelve several times and I have nightly since
We have been down together in my sleep
Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that
From twelve to seventy and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome
Who now are here taking their leaves of me
Though not for Rome itself
CORIOLANUS You bless me gods
AUFIDIUS Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges take
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome
Or rudely visit them in parts remote
To fright them ere destroy But come in
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes
Yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS
The two SERVINGMEN come forward
SECOND SERVANT By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report
of him
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
SECOND SERVANT Nay I knew by his face that there was something in
term it
but I thought there was more in him than I could think
FIRST SERVANT I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot
SECOND SERVANT Who my master
SECOND SERVANT Worth six on him
FIRST SERVANT Nay not so neither but I take him to be the
greater soldier
SECOND SERVANT Faith look you one cannot tell how to say that
for the defence of a town our general is excellent
FIRST SERVANT Ay and for an assault too
THIRD SERVANT I would not be a Roman of all nations
BOTH Wherefore wherefore
Caius Marcius
good enough for him
SECOND SERVANT Come we are fellows and friends He was ever too
hard for him I have heard him say so himself
FIRST SERVANT He was too hard for him directly to say the troth
carbonado
SECOND SERVANT An he had been cannibally given he might have
FIRST SERVANT But more of thy news
THIRD SERVANT Why he is so made on here within as if he were son
asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him
Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself
and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst
THIRD SERVANT But when they shall see sir his crest up again and
the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies
after rain and revel an with him
FIRST SERVANT But when goes this forward
feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips
SECOND SERVANT Why then we shall have a stirring world again
This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and
FIRST SERVANT Let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as
destroyer of men
a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of
cuckolds
FIRST SERVANT Ay and it makes men hate one another
THIRD SERVANT Reason because they then less need one another The
wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians
They are rising they are rising
BOTH In in in in                                   Exeunt

SICINIUS We hear not of him neither need we fear him

And quietness of the people which before
Were in wild hurry here do make his friends
Blush that the world goes well who rather had
Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going
About their functions friendly
Enter MENENIUS
Of late Hail sir
MENENIUS Hail to you both
But with his friends The commonwealth doth stand
And so would do were he more angry at it
SICINIUS Where is he hear you

CITIZENS The gods preserve you both
FIRST CITIZEN Ourselves our wives and children on our knees
Are bound to pray for you both
SICINIUS Live and thrive
CITIZENS Now the gods keep you
BOTH TRIBUNES Farewell farewell             Exeunt citizens
SICINIUS This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets
Crying confusion
BRUTUS Caius Marcius was
SICINIUS And affecting one sole throne
Without assistance
MENENIUS I think not so
SICINIUS We should by this to all our lamentation
If he had gone forth consul found it so
BRUTUS The gods have well prevented it and Rome
Sits safe and still without him
Enter an AEDILE
AEDILE Worthy tribunes
There is a slave whom we have put in prison
Reports the Volsces with several powers
And with the deepest malice of the war
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world
And durst not once peep out
SICINIUS Come what talk you of Marcius
The Volsces dare break with us
MENENIUS Cannot be
We have record that very well it can
And three examples of the like hath been
Within my age But reason with the fellow
Before you punish him where he heard this
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded
SICINIUS Tell not me
I know this cannot be
BRUTUS Not Possible
Enter A MESSENGER
MESSENGER The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the Senate House some news is come
That turns their countenances
Nothing but his report
MESSENGER Yes worthy sir
SICINIUS What more fearful
And vows revenge as spacious as between
SICINIUS This is most likely
Good Marcius home again
MENENIUS This is unlikely
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Enter a second MESSENGER
SECOND MESSENGER You are sent for to the Senate
A fearful army led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius rages
Upon our territories and have already
What lay before them
Enter COMINIUS
COMINIUS O you have made good work
MENENIUS What news what news
COMINIUS You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates
COMINIUS Your temples burned in their cement and
MENENIUS Pray now your news
You have made fair work I fear me Pray your news
COMINIUS If
He is their god he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than Nature
That shapes man better and they follow him
Against us brats with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies
Or butchers killing flies
MENENIUS You have made good work
You and your apron men you that stood so much
Upon the voice of occupation and
Your Rome about your ears
MENENIUS As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair work
BRUTUS But is this true sir
Before you find it other All the regions
Do smilingly revolt and who resists
Your enemies and his find something in him
MENENIUS We are all undone unless
The noble man have mercy
COMINIUS Who shall ask it
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds for his best friends if they
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it I have not the face
You and your crafts You have crafted fair
COMINIUS You have brought
A trembling upon Rome such as was never
BOTH TRIBUNES Say not we brought it
And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
COMINIUS But I fear
The second name of men obeys his points
As if he were his officer Desperation
Is all the policy strength and defence
That Rome can make against them
Enter a troop of citizens
MENENIUS Here comes the clusters
And is Aufidius with him You are they
That made the air unwholesome when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down
If he could burn us all into one coal
PLEBEIANS Faith we hear fearful news
FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part
SECOND CITIZEN And so did I
THIRD CITIZEN And so did I and to say the truth so did very
many of us That we did we did for the best and though we
willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our
will
MENENIUS You have made
COMINIUS O ay what else
Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear Go home
And show no sign of fear
Exeunt citizens
BRUTUS I do not like this news
SICINIUS Nor I
Would buy this for a lie
SCENE VII
A camp at a short distance from Rome
Enter AUFIDIUS with his LIEUTENANT
Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
Their talk at table and their thanks at end
Even by your own
AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now
Unless by using means I lame the foot
Of our design He bears himself more proudlier
Even to my person than I thought he would
When first I did embrace him yet his nature
What cannot be amended
Had borne the action of yourself or else
To him had left it solely
AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure
When he shall come to his account he knows not
What I can urge against him Although it seems
And so he thinks and is no less apparent
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state
As draw his sword yet he hath left undone
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine
AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down
And the nobility of Rome are his
The senators and patricians love him too
The tribunes are no soldiers and their people
Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
As is the osprey to the fish who takes it
By sovereignty of nature First he was
A noble servant to them but he could not
Which out of daily fortune ever taints
The happy man whether defect of judgment
To fail in the disposing of those chances
Which he was lord of or whether nature
Not to be other than one thing not moving
Even with the same austerity and garb
And power unto itself most commendable
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Rome A public place
Enter MENENIUS COMINIUS SICINIUS and BRUTUS the two Tribunes with others
A mile before his tent fall down and knee
COMINIUS He would not seem to know me
MENENIUS Do you hear
COMINIUS Yet one time he did call me by my name
He would not answer to forbid all names
He was a kind of nothing titleless
Of burning Rome
MENENIUS Why so You have made good work
When it was less expected he replied
It was a bare petition of a state
MENENIUS Very well
Could he say less
He could not stay to pick them in a pile
For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
MENENIUS For one poor grain or two
I am one of those His mother wife his child
You are the musty chaff and you are smelt
Above the moon We must be burnt for you
SICINIUS Nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid
More than the instant army we can make
Might stop our countryman
SICINIUS Pray you go to him
MENENIUS What should I do
BRUTUS Only make trial what your love can do
For Rome towards Marcius
MENENIUS Well and say that Marcius
SICINIUS Yet your good will
Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure
As you intended well
And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me
We pout upon the morning are unapt
These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
With wine and feeding we have suppler souls
Till he be dieted to my request
BRUTUS You know the very road into his kindness
And cannot lose your way
Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge
Of my success                                          Exit
SICINIUS Not
COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye
Thus with his speechless hand What he would do
He sent in writing after me what he would not
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions
So that all hope is vain
Unless his noble mother and his wife
Who as I hear mean to solicit him
And with our fair entreaties haste them on           Exeunt
SCENE II
The Volscian camp before Rome
Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard
FIRST WATCH Stay Whence are you
SECOND WATCH Stand and go back

To speak with Coriolanus
FIRST WATCH From whence
MENENIUS From Rome
FIRST WATCH YOU may not pass you must return Our general
Will no more hear from thence
MENENIUS Good my friends
If you have heard your general talk of Rome
And of his friends there it is lots to blanks
FIRST WATCH Be it so go back The virtue of your name
Is not here passable
MENENIUS I tell thee fellow
Thy general is my lover I have been
The book of his good acts whence men have read
Would without lapsing suffer Nay sometimes
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
I must have leave to pass
FIRST WATCH Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf
as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here
no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely
Therefore go back
MENENIUS Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always
factionary on the party of your general
SECOND WATCH Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have I am one that telling true under him must say you cannot
pass Therefore go back
him till after dinner
FIRST WATCH You are a Roman are you
MENENIUS I am as thy general is
FIRST WATCH Then you should hate Rome as he does Can you when
a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think
to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the
virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied
think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame
our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon
MENENIUS Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would use me
with estimation
FIRST WATCH Come my captain knows you not
MENENIUS I mean thy general
FIRST WATCH My general cares not for you Back I say go lest I
your having Back
Enter CORIOLANUS with AUFIDIUS

guardant cannot office me from my son Coriolanus Guess but by my
hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller
upon thee The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father
Menenius does O my son my son thou art preparing fire for us
to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I
have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to
pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage
thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this
who like a block hath denied my access to thee
CORIOLANUS Away
MENENIUS How away
CORIOLANUS Wife mother child I know not My affairs
Are servanted to others Though I owe
My revenge properly my remission lies
In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
Than pity note how much Therefore be gone
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
And would have sent it Another word Menenius
I will not hear thee speak This man Aufidius
AUFIDIUS You keep a constant temper
Exeunt CORIOLANUS and Aufidius
FIRST WATCH Now sir is your name Menenius

said to Away                                          Exit
FIRST WATCH A noble fellow I warrant him
SCENE III
The tent of CORIOLANUS
Enter CORIOLANUS AUFIDIUS and others
Set down our host My partner in this action
I have borne this business
AUFIDIUS Only their ends
The general suit of Rome never admitted
That thought them sure of you
CORIOLANUS This last old man
Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge
The first conditions which they did refuse
And cannot now accept To grace him only
That thought he could do more a very little
I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits
Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
Enter in mourning habits VIRGILIA VOLUMNIA VALERIA
YOUNG MARCIUS with attendants
The grandchild to her blood But out affection
All bond and privilege of nature break
Let it be virtuous to be obstinate
Which can make gods forsworn I melt and am not
Of stronger earth than others My mother bows
As if Olympus to a molehill should
In supplication nod and my young boy
Hath an aspect of intercession which
Be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
As if a man were author of himself
And knew no other kin
VIRGILIA My lord and husband
CORIOLANUS These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome
Makes you think so
CORIOLANUS Like a dull actor now
I have forgot my part and I am out
Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh
Forgive my tyranny but do not say
Long as my exile sweet as my revenge
Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
I carried from thee dear and my true lip
And the most noble mother of the world
Of thy deep duty more impression show
Than that of common sons
VOLUMNIA O stand up blest
Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
I kneel before thee and unproperly
Show duty as mistaken all this while
Your knees to me to your corrected son
Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
What cannot be slight work
VOLUMNIA Thou art my warrior
I holp to frame thee Do you know this lady
CORIOLANUS The noble sister of Publicola
The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle
VOLUMNIA This is a poor epitome of yours
May show like all yourself
CORIOLANUS The god of soldiers
With the consent of supreme Jove inform
Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
And saving those that eye thee
VOLUMNIA Your knee sirrah
VOLUMNIA Even he your wife this lady and myself
Are suitors to you
CORIOLANUS I beseech you peace
The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
Be held by you denials Do not bid me
Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
Wherein I seem unnatural desire not
Your colder reasons
VOLUMNIA O no more no more
For we have nothing else to ask but that
Which you deny already yet we will ask
That if you fail in our request the blame
May hang upon your hardness therefore hear us
Hear nought from Rome in private Your request
VOLUMNIA Should we be silent and not speak our raiment
And state of bodies would bewray what life
We have led since thy exile Think with thyself
How more unfortunate than all living women
Are we come hither since that thy sight which should
Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
Making the mother wife and child to see
The son the husband and the father tearing
Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
That all but we enjoy For how can we
Alas how can we for our country pray
Whereto we are bound together with thy victory
Whereto we are bound Alack or we must lose
The country our dear nurse or else thy person
Our comfort in the country We must find
An evident calamity though we had
Our wish which side should win for either thou
Must as a foreign recreant be led
With manacles through our streets or else
And bear the palm for having bravely shed
I purpose not to wait on fortune till
These wars determine if I can not persuade thee
Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
That brought thee to this world
VIRGILIA Ay and mine
That brought you forth this boy to keep your name
Living to time
VOLUMNIA Nay go not from us thus
If it were so that our request did tend
To save the Romans thereby to destroy
The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
As poisonous of your honour No our suit
Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces
That if thou conquer Rome the benefit
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
To imitate the graces of the gods
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak
Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you
He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
When she poor hen fond of no second brood
And spurn me back but if it he not so
Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
Down ladies let us shame him with our knees
Than pity to our prayers Down An end
This is the last So we will home to Rome
This boy that cannot tell what he would have
But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship
Does reason our petition with more strength
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother
His wife is in Corioli and his child
Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch
CORIOLANUS O mother mother
What have you done Behold the heavens do ope
The gods look down and this unnatural scene
They laugh at O my mother mother O
You have won a happy victory to Rome
If not most mortal to him But let it come
Aufidius though I cannot make true wars
Were you in my stead would you have heard
A mother less or granted less Aufidius
CORIOLANUS I dare be sworn you were
And sir it is no little thing to make
Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir
Stand to me in this cause O mother wife
honour
Myself a former fortune
But we will drink together and you shall bear
A better witness back than words which we
Come enter with us Ladies you deserve
To have a temple built you All the swords
In Italy and her confederate arms
Could not have made this peace                       Exeunt
SCENE IV
Rome A public place
Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS
SICINIUS Why what of that
MENENIUS If it be possible for you to displace it with your little
finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his
condition of a man
MENENIUS There is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet
your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown from man to
MENENIUS So did he me and he no more remembers his mother now
grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground
shrinks before his treading He is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery He sits in
his state as a thing made for Alexander What he bids be done is
eternity and a heaven to throne in
MENENIUS I paint him in the character Mark what mercy his mother
shall bring from him There is no more mercy in him than there is
milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find And all this
SICINIUS The gods be good unto us
MENENIUS No in such a case the gods will not be good unto us
break our necks they respect not us
Enter a MESSENGER
The plebeians have got your fellow tribune
And hale him up and down all swearing if
The Roman ladies bring not comfort home
Enter another MESSENGER
A merrier day did never yet greet Rome
SICINIUS Friend
SECOND MESSENGER As certain as I know the sun is fire
The trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
Tabors and cymbals and the shouting Romans
MENENIUS This is good news
I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia
Is worth of consuls senators patricians
A city full of tribunes such as you
This morning for ten thousand of your throats
SICINIUS First the gods bless you for your tidings next
Accept my thankfulness
SECOND MESSENGER Sir we have all
Great cause to give great thanks
SICINIUS They are near the city
MESSENGER Almost at point to enter
And help the joy                                     Exeunt
SCENE V
Rome A street near the gate
Enter two SENATORS With VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA VALERIA passing over the stage
FIRST SENATOR Behold our patroness the life of Rome
Call all your tribes together praise the gods
And make triumphant fires strew flowers before them
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother
ALL Welcome ladies welcome
SCENE VI
Corioli A public place
Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS with attendents
Will vouch the truth of it Him I accuse
To purge himself with words Dispatch
Exeunt attendants
Most welcome
FIRST CONSPIRATOR How is it with our general
AUFIDIUS Even so
And with his charity slain
SECOND CONSPIRATOR Most noble sir
If you do hold the same intent wherein
Of your great danger
AUFIDIUS Sir I cannot tell
We must proceed as we do find the people
THIRD CONSPIRATOR The people will remain uncertain whilst
Makes the survivor heir of all
AUFIDIUS I know it
And my pretext to strike at him admits
He watered his new plants with dews of flattery
Seducing so my friends and to this end
But to be rough unswayable and free
THIRD CONSPIRATOR Sir his stoutness
When he did stand for consul which he lost
AUFIDIUS That I would have spoken of
Presented to my knife his throat I took him
In all his own desires nay let him choose
Out of my files his projects to accomplish
In mine own person holp to reap the fame
Which he did end all his and took some pride
To do myself this wrong Till at the last
I had been mercenary
FIRST CONSPIRATOR So he did my lord
AUFIDIUS There was it
As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
Of our great action therefore shall he die
And had no welcomes home but he returns
Splitting the air with noise
SECOND CONSPIRATOR And patient fools
Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
With giving him glory
THIRD CONSPIRATOR Therefore at your vantage
Ere he express himself or move the people
With what he would say let him feel your sword
Which we will second When he lies along
His reasons with his body
AUFIDIUS Say no more
Here come the lords
Enter the LORDS of the city
LORDS You are most welcome home
But worthy lords have you with heed perused
What I have written to you
LORDS We have
What faults he made before the last I think
Might have found easy fines but there to end
Where he was to begin and give away
The benefit of our levies answering us
With our own charge making a treaty where
AUFIDIUS He approaches you shall hear him
Enter CORIOLANUS marching with drum and colours
the commoners being with him
Than when I parted hence but still subsisting
Under your great command You are to know
That prosperously I have attempted and
With bloody passage led your wars even to
The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home
Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
The charges of the action We have made peace
With no less honour to the Antiates
We have compounded on
AUFIDIUS Read it not noble lords
But tell the traitor in the highest degree
CORIOLANUS Traitor How now
AUFIDIUS Ay traitor Marcius
CORIOLANUS Marcius
AUFIDIUS Ay Marcius Caius Marcius Dost thou think
Coriolanus in Corioli
Breaking his oath and resolution like
A twist of rotten silk never admitting
CORIOLANUS Ha
CORIOLANUS Measureless liar thou hast made my heart
To thrust the lie unto him
FIRST LORD Peace both and hear me speak
CORIOLANUS Cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads
AUFIDIUS Why noble lords
Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
Which was your shame by this unholy braggart
Fore your own eyes and ears
father
The man is noble and his fame folds in
Shall have judicious hearing Stand Aufidius
And trouble not the peace
CORIOLANUS O that I had him
To use my lawful sword
AUFIDIUS Insolent villain
CONSPIRATORS Kill kill kill kill kill him
LORDS Hold hold hold hold
AUFIDIUS My noble masters hear me speak
FIRST LORD O Tullus
SECOND LORD Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep
THIRD LORD Tread not upon him Masters all be quiet
Put up your swords
That he is thus cut off Please it your honours
Myself your loyal servant or endure
Your heaviest censure
FIRST LORD Bear from hence his body
And mourn you for him Let him be regarded
As the most noble corse that ever herald
Did follow to his um
SECOND LORD His own impatience
Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame
AUFIDIUS My rage is gone
And I am struck with sorrow Take him up
Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully
Trail your steel pikes Though in this city he
Hath widowed and unchilded many a one
Which to this hour bewail the injury
Yet he shall have a noble memory
Assist               Exeunt bearing the body of CORIOLANUS

ACT I SCENE I
FIRST GENTLEMAN You do not meet a man but frowns our bloods
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
Is outward sorrow though I think the King
SECOND GENTLEMAN None but the King
FIRST GENTLEMAN He that hath lost her too So is the Queen
Although they wear their faces to the bent
Glad at the thing they scowl at
SECOND GENTLEMAN And why so
I mean that married her alack good man
As to seek through the regions of the earth
For one his like there would be something failing
In him that should compare I do not think
So fair an outward and such stuff within
Endows a man but he
SECOND GENTLEMAN You speak him far
FIRST GENTLEMAN I do extend him sir within himself
Crush him together rather than unfold
His measure duly
FIRST GENTLEMAN I cannot delve him to the root his father
Against the Romans with Cassibelan
But had his titles by Tenantius whom
And had besides this gentleman in question
Died with their swords in hand for which their father
Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow
That he quit being and his gentle lady
As he was born The King he takes the babe
To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus
Puts to him all the learnings that his time
Could make him the receiver of which he took
A glass that feated them and to the graver
A child that guided dotards To his mistress
By her election may be truly read
What kind of man he is
SECOND GENTLEMAN I honour him
Even out of your report But pray you tell me
FIRST GENTLEMAN His only child
Which way they went
SECOND GENTLEMAN How long is this ago
FIRST GENTLEMAN Some twenty years
So slackly guarded and the search so slow
That could not trace them
Yet is it true sir
SECOND GENTLEMAN I do well believe you
FIRST GENTLEMAN We must forbear here comes the gentleman
The Queen and Princess                              Exeunt
Enter the QUEEN POSTHUMUS and IMOGEN
After the slander of most stepmothers
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
That lock up your restraint For you Posthumus
I will be known your advocate Marry yet
Your wisdom may inform you
POSTHUMUS Please your Highness
QUEEN You know the peril
IMOGEN O dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant
Can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband
His rage can do on me You must be gone
And I shall here abide the hourly shot
Of angry eyes not comforted to live
But that there is this jewel in the world
That I may see again
POSTHUMUS My queen my mistress
O lady weep no more lest I give cause
To be suspected of more tenderness
Than doth become a man I will remain
Who to my father was a friend to me
Known but by letter thither write my queen
Though ink be made of gall
QUEEN Be brief I pray you
If the King come I shall incur I know not
To walk this way I never do him wrong
But he does buy my injuries to be friends
Pays dear for my offences                              Exit
POSTHUMUS Should we be taking leave
As long a term as yet we have to live
The loathness to depart would grow Adieu
IMOGEN Nay stay a little
Were you but riding forth to air yourself
Such parting were too petty Look here love
But keep it till you woo another wife
When Imogen is dead
POSTHUMUS How how Another
You gentle gods give me but this I have
And sear up my embracements from a next
With bonds of death Remain remain thou here
While sense can keep it on And sweetest fairest
As I my poor self did exchange for you
To your so infinite loss so in our trifles
I still win of you For my sake wear this
IMOGEN O the gods
When shall we see again
Enter CYMBELINE and LORDS
POSTHUMUS Alack the King
CYMBELINE Thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight
If after this command thou fraught the court
With thy unworthiness thou diest Away
POSTHUMUS The gods protect you
And bless the good remainders of the court
I am gone                                              Exit
IMOGEN There cannot be a pinch in death
More sharp than this is
CYMBELINE O disloyal thing
IMOGEN I beseech you sir
Harm not yourself with your vexation
I am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare
Subdues all pangs all fears
CYMBELINE Past grace obedience
IMOGEN Past hope and in despair that way past grace
CYMBELINE That mightst have had the sole son of my queen
IMOGEN O blessed that I might not I chose an eagle
And did avoid a puttock
A seat for baseness
IMOGEN No I rather added
A lustre to it
CYMBELINE O thou vile one
IMOGEN Sir
You bred him as my playfellow and he is
A man worth any woman overbuys me
Almost the sum he pays
CYMBELINE What art thou mad
IMOGEN Almost sir Heaven restore me Would I were
CYMBELINE Thou foolish thing
Not after our command Away with her
And pen her up
Leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort
Out of your best advice
CYMBELINE Nay let her languish
A drop of blood a day and being aged
Die of this folly                          Exit with LORDS
Enter PISANIO
QUEEN Fie you must give way
Here is your servant How now sir What news
PISANIO My lord your son drew on my master
QUEEN Ha
No harm I trust is done
PISANIO There might have been
And had no help of anger they were parted
By gentlemen at hand
To draw upon an exile O brave sir
I would they were in Afric both together
Myself by with a needle that I might prick
PISANIO On his command He would not suffer me
To bring him to the haven left these notes
Of what commands I should be subject to
QUEEN This hath been
Your faithful servant I dare lay mine honour
He will remain so
PISANIO I humbly thank your Highness
QUEEN Pray walk awhile
Pray you speak with me You shall at least
Go see my lord aboard For this time leave me        Exeunt
SCENE II
Britain A public place
Enter CLOTEN and two LORDS
FIRST LORD Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence
of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice Where air comes out
CLOTEN If my shirt were bloody then to shift it Have I hurt him
hurt It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt
side the town
CLOTEN The villain would not stand me
face
FIRST LORD Stand you You have land enough of your own but he
added to your having gave you some ground
Puppies
CLOTEN I would they had not come between us
fool you were upon the ground
CLOTEN And that she should love this fellow and refuse me
FIRST LORD Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go
of her wit
should hurt her
done
an ass which is no great hurt
SECOND LORD Well my lord                             Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO
That he spake to thee
PISANIO It was his queen his queen
IMOGEN Senseless linen happier therein than I
And that was all
PISANIO No madam for so long
As he could make me with his eye or care
Distinguish him from others he did keep
The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief
How swift his ship
IMOGEN Thou shouldst have made him
As little as a crow or less ere left
PISANIO Madam so I did
To look upon him till the diminution
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle
Nay followed him till he had melted from
The smallness of a gnat to air and then
When shall we hear from him
With his next vantage
IMOGEN I did not take my leave of him but had
Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him
How I would think on him at certain hours
Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear
The shes of Italy should not betray
At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight
I am in heaven for him or ere I could
Give him that parting kiss which I had set
Betwixt two charming words comes in my father
And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
Shakes all our buds from growing
Enter a LADY
LADY The Queen madam
I will attend the Queen
PISANIO Madam I shall                                Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter PHILARIO IACHIMO a FRENCHMAN a DUTCHMAN and a SPANIARD
IACHIMO Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He was then
of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath
without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his
endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by
items
is with that which makes him both without and within
FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France we had very many there could
behold the sun with as firm eyes as he
must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I
doubt not a great deal from the matter
FRENCHMAN And then his banishment
IACHIMO Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable
divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it
but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay
flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it
he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance
PHILARIO His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have
been often bound for no less than my life
Enter POSTHUMUS
Here comes the Briton Let him be so entertained amongst you as
suits with gentlemen of your knowing to a stranger of his
quality I beseech you all be better known to this gentleman
whom I commend to you as a noble friend of mine How worthy he is
I will leave to appear hereafter rather than story him in his
own hearing
FRENCHMAN Sir we have known together in Orleans
POSTHUMUS Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still
atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have
been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore
upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature
POSTHUMUS By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller
altogether slight
FRENCHMAN Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and
by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the
IACHIMO Can we with manners ask what was the difference
may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like
an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in
praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time
fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less
attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France
by this worn out
POSTHUMUS She holds her virtue still and I my mind
IACHIMO You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy
her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend
had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain
If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours
outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she
excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that
is nor you the lady
IACHIMO What do you esteem it at
POSTHUMUS More than the world enjoys
POSTHUMUS You are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there
were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the
other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods
IACHIMO Which the gods have given you
POSTHUMUS Which by their graces I will keep
IACHIMO You may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl
your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and
courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last
convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of
that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of
thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring
PHILARIO Let us leave here gentlemen
POSTHUMUS Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank
him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first
IACHIMO With five times so much conversation I should get ground
of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had
I admittance and opportunity to friend
POSTHUMUS No no
IACHIMO I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your
my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and
to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any
lady in the world
POSTHUMUS A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve
PHILARIO Gentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let
it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted
approbation of what I have spoke
POSTHUMUS What lady would you choose to assail
IACHIMO Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will
lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the
court where your lady is with no more advantage than the
opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence
POSTHUMUS I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I
IACHIMO You are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy
tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear
POSTHUMUS This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver
purpose I hope
spoken I swear
POSTHUMUS Will you I Shall but lend my diamond till your return
goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to
PHILARIO I will have it no lay
IACHIMO By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient
mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond
too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have
provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment
POSTHUMUS I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt
us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon
answer me with your sword
by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the
bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and
have our two wagers recorded
POSTHUMUS Agreed                Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO
FRENCHMAN Will this hold think you
Exeunt
SCENE V
Enter QUEEN LADIES and CORNELIUS
Make haste who has the note of them
LADY I madam
QUEEN Dispatch                                 Exeunt LADIES
Now Master Doctor have you brought those drugs
CORNELIUS Pleaseth your Highness ay Here they are madam
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds
Which are the movers of a languishing death
But though slow deadly
QUEEN I wonder Doctor
To make perfumes distil preserve yea so
That our great king himself doth woo me oft
That I did amplify my judgment in
Other conclusions I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
To try the vigour of them and apply
Allayments to their act and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects
CORNELIUS Your Highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart
Besides the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious
QUEEN O content thee
Enter PISANIO
Doctor your service for this time is ended
Take your own way
But you shall do no harm
And will not trust one of her malice with
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile
Then afterward up higher but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes
More than the locking up the spirits a time
With a most false effect and I the truer
So to be false with her
QUEEN No further service Doctor
Until I send for thee
CORNELIUS I humbly take my leave                        Exit
She will not quench and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses Do thou work
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son
As great as is thy master greater for
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
Is at last gasp Return he cannot nor
Continue where he is To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another
And every day that comes comes comes to
To be depender on a thing that leans
Who cannot be new built nor has no friends
So much as but to prop him
It is a thing I made which hath the King
What is more cordial Nay I prithee take it
It is an earnest of a further good
That I mean to thee Tell thy mistress how
Think what a chance thou changest on but think
Thou hast thy mistress still to boot my son
To any shape of thy preferment such
That set thee on to this desert am bound
To load thy merit richly Call my women
Think on my words                              Exit PISANIO
A sly and constant knave
And the remembrancer of her to hold
Which if he take shall quite unpeople her
Of leigers for her sweet and which she after
To taste of too
So so Well done well done
The violets cowslips and the primroses
Bear to my closet Fare thee well Pisanio
Think on my words                   Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES
PISANIO And shall do
But when to my good lord I prove untrue
SCENE VI
Britain The palace
Enter IMOGEN alone
A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
My supreme crown of grief and those repeated
As my two brothers happy but most miserable
Which seasons comfort Who may this be Fie
Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO
PISANIO Madam a noble gentleman of Rome
Comes from my lord with letters
IACHIMO Change you madam
The worthy Leonatus is in safety
IMOGEN Thanks good sir
Have lost the wager Boldness be my friend
Arm me audacity from head to foot
Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight
Rather directly fly
kindnesses I am most infinitely tied Reflect upon him
So far I read aloud
But even the very middle of my heart
You are as welcome worthy sir as I
Have words to bid you and shall find it so
In all that I can do
IACHIMO Thanks fairest lady
What are men mad Hath nature given them eyes
To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
Partition make with spectacles so precious
IMOGEN What makes your admiration
For idiots in this case of favour would
Should make desire vomit emptiness
IMOGEN What is the matter trow
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire that tub
Longs after for the garbage
IMOGEN What dear sir
Thus raps you Are you well
PISANIO I was going sir
To give him welcome                                    Exit
IMOGEN Continues well my lord His health beseech you
IACHIMO Well madam
IACHIMO Exceeding pleasant none a stranger there
The Britain reveller
IMOGEN When he was here
Not knowing why
IACHIMO I never saw him sad
There is a Frenchman his companion one
An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
A Gallian girl at home He furnaces
By history report or his own proof
What woman is yea what she cannot choose
IMOGEN Will my lord say so
IACHIMO Ay madam with his eyes in flood with laughter
It is a recreation to be by
And hear him mock the Frenchman But heavens know
Some men are much to blame
IMOGEN Not he I hope
In you which I account his beyond all talents
Whilst I am bound to wonder I am bound
To pity too
IMOGEN What do you pity sir
IACHIMO Two creatures heartily
IMOGEN Am I one sir
You look on me what wreck discern you in me
Deserves your pity
IACHIMO Lamentable What
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
IMOGEN I pray you sir
Deliver with more openness your answers
To my demands Why do you pity me
IACHIMO That others do
It is an office of the gods to venge it
IMOGEN You do seem to know
Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
Than to be sure they do for certainties
Either are past remedies or timely knowing
What both you spur and stop
IACHIMO Had I this cheek
To bathe my lips upon this hand whose touch
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
That mount the Capitol join gripes with hands
Base and illustrious as the smoky light
That all the plagues of hell should at one time
Encounter such revolt
IMOGEN My lord I fear
Has forgot Britain
IACHIMO And himself Not I
That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
Charms this report out
IMOGEN Let me hear no more
IACHIMO O dearest soul your cause doth strike my heart
With pity that doth make me sick A lady
That play with all infirmities for gold
Or she that bore you was no queen and you
Recoil from your great stock
As I have such a heart that both mine ears
IACHIMO Should he make me
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps
In your despite upon your purse Revenge it
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure
More noble than that runagate to your bed
And will continue fast to your affection
Still close as sure
IMOGEN What ho Pisanio
IACHIMO Let me my service tender on your lips
IMOGEN Away I do condemn mine ears that have
So long attended thee If thou wert honourable
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue not
From thy report as thou from honour and
Solicits here a lady that disdains
The King my father shall be made acquainted
Of thy assault If he shall think it fit
A saucy stranger in his court to mart
As in a Romish stew and to expound
His beastly mind to us he hath a court
He little cares for and a daughter who
IACHIMO O happy Leonatus I may say
The credit that thy lady hath of thee
Deserves thy trust and thy most perfect goodness
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
For the most worthiest fit Give me your pardon
I have spoke this to know if your affiance
Were deeply rooted and shall make your lord
That he enchants societies into him
IMOGEN You make amends
He hath a kind of honour sets him of
More than a mortal seeming Be not angry
To try your taking of a false report which hath
In the election of a sir so rare
Which you know cannot err The love I bear him
Made me to fan you thus but the gods made you
Unlike all others chaffless Pray your pardon
IACHIMO My humble thanks I had almost forgot
And yet of moment too for it concerns
Your lord myself and other noble friends
Are partners in the business
To buy a present for the Emperor
Which I the factor for the rest have done
Of rich and exquisite form their values great
And I am something curious being strange
To have them in safe stowage May it please you
To take them in protection
IMOGEN Willingly
And pawn mine honour for their safety Since
My lord hath interest in them I will keep them
In my bedchamber
IACHIMO They are in a trunk
Attended by my men I will make bold
To send them to you only for this night
IMOGEN O no no
IACHIMO Yes I beseech or I shall short my word
To see your Grace
IMOGEN I thank you for your pains
IACHIMO O I must madam
Therefore I shall beseech you if you please
I have outstood my time which is material
IMOGEN I will write
Send your trunk to me it shall safe be kept

ACT II SCENE I
Enter CLOTEN and the two LORDS

borrowed mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my
pleasure
FIRST LORD What got he by that You have broke his pate with your
bowl

CLOTEN Whoreson dog I give him satisfaction Would he had been
one of my rank
had rather not be so noble as I am they dare not fight with me
because of the Queen my mother Every jackslave hath his bellyful
of fighting and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody
can match
cock with your comb on
CLOTEN Sayest thou
SECOND LORD It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
companion that you give offence to
CLOTEN No I know that but it is fit I should commit offence to
my inferiors
SECOND LORD Ay it is fit for your lordship only
CLOTEN Why so I say

CLOTEN Is it fit I went to look upon him Is there no derogation
SECOND LORD You cannot derogate my lord
CLOTEN Not easily I think
being foolish do not derogate
Exeunt CLOTEN and FIRST LORD
That such a crafty devil as is his mother
Should yield the world this ass A woman that
Bears all down with her brain and this her son
Cannot take two from twenty for his heart
And leave eighteen Alas poor princess
A mother hourly coining plots a wooer
More hateful than the foul expulsion is
Of thy dear husband than that horrid act
That temple thy fair mind that thou mayst stand
SCENE II
Enter IMOGEN in her bed and a LADY attending
LADY Please you madam
IMOGEN What hour is it
LADY Almost midnight madam
IMOGEN I have read three hours then Mine eyes are weak
Fold down the leaf where I have left To bed
Take not away the taper leave it burning
To your protection I commend me gods
From fairies and the tempters of the night
Guard me beseech ye
Repairs itself by rest Our Tarquin thus
The chastity he wounded Cytherea
And whiter than the sheets That I might touch
To note the chamber I will write all down
Such and such pictures there the window such
Ah but some natural notes about her body
Above ten thousand meaner movables
O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her
And be her sense but as a monument
Thus in a chapel lying Come off come off
As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard
As strongly as the conscience does within
Stronger than ever law could make this secret
The treasure of her honour No more To what end
Where Philomel gave up I have enough
Swift swift you dragons of the night that dawning
One two three Time time             Exit into the trunk
SCENE III
Enter CLOTEN and LORDS
FIRST LORD Your lordship is the most patient man in loss the most
CLOTEN It would make any man cold to lose
FIRST LORD But not every man patient after the noble temper of
your lordship You are most hot and furious when you win
CLOTEN Winning will put any man into courage If I could get this
FIRST LORD Day my lord
CLOTEN I would this music would come I am advised to give her
music a mornings they say it will penetrate
Enter musicians
Come on tune If you can penetrate her with your fingering so
thing after a wonderful sweet air with admirable rich words to
SONG
His steeds to water at those springs
To ope their golden eyes
With everything that pretty bin
My lady sweet arise
Arise arise
So get you gone If this penetrate I will consider your music
the better if it do not it is a vice in her ears which
boot can never amend                      Exeunt musicians
Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
SECOND LORD Here comes the King
so early He cannot choose but take this service I have done
CYMBELINE Attend you here the door of our stern daughter
Will she not forth
notice
CYMBELINE The exile of her minion is too new
She hath not yet forgot him some more time
Must wear the print of his remembrance out
Who lets go by no vantages that may
Prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself
To orderly soliciting and be friended
With aptness of the season make denials
Increase your services so seem as if
You tender to her that you in all obey her
Save when command to your dismission tends
And therein you are senseless
CLOTEN Senseless Not so
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER So like you sir ambassadors from Rome
The one is Caius Lucius
CYMBELINE A worthy fellow
Albeit he comes on angry purpose now
According to the honour of his sender
And towards himself his goodness forespent on us
We must extend our notice Our dear son
When you have given good morning to your mistress
Attend the Queen and us we shall have need
Exeunt all but CLOTEN
I know her women are about her what
Nay sometime hangs both thief and true man What
Can it not do and undo I will make
One of her women lawyer to me for
I yet not understand the case myself
Enter a LADY
CLOTEN A gentleman
LADY No more
Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours
LADY Ay
To keep her chamber
CLOTEN There is gold for you sell me your good report
LADY How My good name or to report of you
What I shall think is good The Princess
Enter IMOGEN
CLOTEN Good morrow fairest sister Your sweet hand
Exit LADY
IMOGEN Good morrow sir You lay out too much pains
For purchasing but trouble The thanks I give
Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
And scarce can spare them
CLOTEN Still I swear I love you
If you swear still your recompense is still
That I regard it not
CLOTEN This is no answer
IMOGEN But that you shall not say I yield being silent
I would not speak I pray you spare me Faith
I shall unfold equal discourtesy
To your best kindness one of your great knowing
Should learn being taught forbearance
I will not
IMOGEN Fools are not mad folks
CLOTEN Do you call me fool
IMOGEN As I am mad I do
That cures us both I am much sorry sir
By being so verbal and learn now for all
That I which know my heart do here pronounce
And am so near the lack of charity
To accuse myself I hate you which I had rather
CLOTEN You sin against
Obedience which you owe your father For
The contract you pretend with that base wretch
On whom there is no more dependency
The precious note of it with a base slave
IMOGEN Profane fellow
Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
But what thou art besides thou wert too base
To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough
CLOTEN The south fog rot him
IMOGEN He never can meet more mischance than come
In my respect than all the hairs above thee
Were they all made such men How now Pisanio
Enter PISANIO
IMOGEN To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently
IMOGEN I am sprited with a fool
Search for a jewel that too casually
If I would lose it for a revenue
I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
That I kiss aught but he
IMOGEN I hope so Go and search                 Exit PISANIO
IMOGEN Ay I said so sir
CLOTEN I will inform your father
IMOGEN Your mother too
But the worst of me So I leave you sir
SCENE IV
Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO
POSTHUMUS Fear it not sir I would I were so sure
To win the King as I am bold her honour
Will remain hers
PHILARIO What means do you make to him
POSTHUMUS Not any but abide the change of time
I barely gratify your love they failing
I must die much your debtor
PHILARIO Your very goodness and your company
Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius
Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance
Is yet fresh in their grief
POSTHUMUS I do believe
Statist though I am none nor like to be
That this will prove a war and you shall hear
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen
Worthy his frowning at Their discipline
Now mingled with their courages will make known
To their approvers they are people such
That mend upon the world
Enter IACHIMO
PHILARIO See Iachimo
POSTHUMUS The swiftest harts have posted you by land
To make your vessel nimble
PHILARIO Welcome sir
POSTHUMUS I hope the briefness of your answer made
The speediness of your return
IACHIMO Your lady
POSTHUMUS And therewithal the best or let her beauty
Look through a casement to allure false hearts
And be false with them
IACHIMO Here are letters for you
POSTHUMUS Their tenour good I trust
PHILARIO Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
When you were there
IACHIMO He was expected then
POSTHUMUS All is well yet
Too dull for your good wearing
IACHIMO If I have lost it
I should have lost the worth of it in gold
A second night of such sweet shortness which
Was mine in Britain for the ring is won
IACHIMO Not a whit
Your lady being so easy
POSTHUMUS Make not sir
Your loss your sport I hope you know that we
Must not continue friends
IACHIMO Good sir we must
If you keep covenant Had I not brought
The knowledge of your mistress home I grant
We were to question farther but I now
Profess myself the winner of her honour
Together with your ring and not the wronger
Of her or you having proceeded but
By both your wills
That you have tasted her in bed my hand
And ring is yours If not the foul opinion
You had of her pure honour gains or loses
Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both
To who shall find them
IACHIMO Sir my circumstances
Being so near the truth as I will make them
I will confirm with oath which I doubt not
You need it not
POSTHUMUS Proceed
IACHIMO First her bedchamber
Where I confess I slept not but profess
With tapestry of silk and silver the story
Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman
The press of boats or pride A piece of work
So bravely done so rich that it did strive
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought
POSTHUMUS This is true
And this you might have heard of here by me
Or by some other
IACHIMO More particulars
Must justify my knowledge
POSTHUMUS So they must
Or do your honour injury
IACHIMO The chimney
Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece
Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures
So likely to report themselves The cutter
Was as another nature dumb outwent her
Motion and breath left out
POSTHUMUS This is a thing
Which you might from relation likewise reap
Being as it is much spoke of
Of silver each on one foot standing nicely
Depending on their brands
POSTHUMUS This is her honour
Let it be granted you have seen all this and praise
Be given to your remembrance the description
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
The wager you have laid
Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel See
POSTHUMUS Jove
Once more let me behold it Is it that
Which I left with her
Her pretty action did outsell her gift
To send it me
IACHIMO She writes so to you doth she
It is a basilisk unto mine eye
Where there is beauty truth where semblance love
Of no more bondage be to where they are made
Than they are to their virtues which is nothing
O above measure false
PHILARIO Have patience sir
It may be probable she lost it or
Who knows if one her women being corrupted
POSTHUMUS Very true
Render to me some corporal sign about her
IACHIMO By Jupiter I had it from her arm
POSTHUMUS Hark you he swears by Jupiter he swears
She would not lose it Her attendants are
The cognizance of her incontinency
Is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly
There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell
Divide themselves between you
PHILARIO Sir be patient
Of one persuaded well of
She hath been colted by him
IACHIMO If you seek
Of that most delicate lodging By my life
To feed again though full You do remember
This stain upon her
POSTHUMUS Ay and it doth confirm
Another stain as big as hell can hold
Were there no more but it
IACHIMO Will you hear more
POSTHUMUS Spare your arithmetic never count the turns
Once and a million
POSTHUMUS No swearing
And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
PHILARIO Quite besides
The government of patience You have won
He hath against himself
IACHIMO With all my heart                             Exeunt
SCENE V
Enter POSTHUMUS
POSTHUMUS Is there no way for men to be but women
And that most venerable man which I
Did call my father was I know not where
The Dian of that time So doth my wife
The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance
Should from encounter guard Could I find out
That tends to vice in man but I affirm
Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers
Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain
Nice longing slanders mutability
All faults that man may name nay that hell knows
Why hers in part or all but rather all
For even to vice
They are not constant but are changing still
One vice but of a minute old for one
In a true hate to pray they have their will
The very devils cannot plague them better              Exit

ACT III SCENE I
Enter in state CYMBELINE QUEEN CLOTEN and LORDS at one door
and at another CAIUS LUCIUS and attendants
CYMBELINE Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us
Than in his feats deserving it for him
And his succession granted Rome a tribute
Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately
QUEEN And to kill the marvel
Shall be so ever
CLOTEN There be many Caesars
Ere such another Julius Britain is
A world by itself and we will nothing pay
For wearing our own noses
QUEEN That opportunity
We have again Remember sir my liege
The kings your ancestors together with
The natural bravery of your isle which stands
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters
Caesar made here but made not here his brag
And Britons strut with courage
stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no
owe such straight arms none
CYMBELINE Son let your mother end
CLOTEN We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan
I do not say I am one but I have a hand Why tribute Why should
we pay tribute If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket
or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light
else sir no more tribute pray you now
CYMBELINE You must know
Till the injurious Romans did extort
Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon
Ourselves to be
CLOTEN We do
CYMBELINE Say then to Caesar
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise
Shall by the power we hold be our good deed
Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws
Who was the first of Britain which did put
Himself a king
LUCIUS I am sorry Cymbeline
Caesar that hath moe kings his servants than
Receive it from me then war and confusion
For fury not to be resisted Thus defied
I thank thee for myself
CYMBELINE Thou art welcome Caius
Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent
Which he to seek of me again perforce
Behoves me keep at utterance I am perfect
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
Their liberties are now in arms a precedent
Which not to read would show the Britons cold
So Caesar shall not find them
LUCIUS Let proof speak
CLOTEN His majesty bids you welcome Make pastime with us a day or
two or longer If you seek us afterwards in other terms you
it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare
LUCIUS So sir
All the remain is welcome                           Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter PISANIO reading of a letter
PISANIO How of adultery Wherefore write you not
What monsters her accuse Leonatus
O master what a strange infection
On thy too ready hearing Disloyal No
As would take in some virtue O my master
Thy mind to her is now as low as were
Thy fortunes How that I should murder her
Upon the love and truth and vows which I
Have made to thy command I her Her blood
If it be so to do good service never
Let me be counted serviceable How look I
That I should seem to lack humanity
That I have sent her by her own command
Enter IMOGEN
I am ignorant in what I am commanded
IMOGEN How now Pisanio
PISANIO Madam here is a letter from my lord
All but in that Good wax thy leave Blest be
You bees that make these locks of counsel Lovers
And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike
Though forfeiters you cast in prison yet
dominion could not be so cruel to me as you O the dearest of
creatures would even renew me with your eyes Take notice that I
am in Cambria at Milford Haven What your own love will out of
this advise you follow So he wishes you all happiness that
remains loyal to his vow and your increasing in love
He is at Milford Haven Read and tell me
May plod it in a week why may not I
Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
How we may steal from hence and for the gap
And our return to excuse But first how get hence
Why should excuse be born or ere begot
How many score of miles may we well ride
Could never go so slow I have heard of riding wagers
Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
Go bid my woman feign a sickness say
A riding suit no costlier than would fit
IMOGEN I see before me man Nor here nor here
Nor what ensues but have a fog in them
That I cannot look through Away I prithee
Accessible is none but Milford way                   Exeunt
SCENE III
Wales A mountainous country with a cave
Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
BELARIUS A goodly day not to keep house with such
And keep their impious turbans on without
Good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven
As prouder livers do
GUIDERIUS Hail heaven
ARVIRAGUS Hail heaven
BELARIUS Now for our mountain sport Up to yond hill
When you above perceive me like a crow
That it is place which lessens and sets off
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
Of courts of princes of the tricks in war
This service is not service so being done
Draws us a profit from all things we see
And often to our comfort shall we find
The sharded beetle in a safer hold
Is nobler than attending for a check
Richer than doing nothing for a bribe
Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine
If quiet life be best sweeter to you
That have a sharper known well corresponding
With your stiff age But unto us it is
A cell of ignorance travelling abed
A prison for a debtor that not dares
To stride a limit
ARVIRAGUS What should we speak of
When we are old as you When we shall hear
The rain and wind beat dark December how
In this our pinching cave shall we discourse
The freezing hours away We have seen nothing
We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey
Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat
Our valour is to chase what flies our cage
And sing our bondage freely
BELARIUS How you speak
As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb
A pain that only seems to seek out danger
As record of fair act nay many times
Must curtsy at the censure O boys this story
With Roman swords and my report was once
And when a soldier was the theme my name
Was not far off Then was I as a tree
Whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night
A storm or robbery call it what you will
Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves
And left me bare to weather
GUIDERIUS Uncertain favour
Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline
I was confederate with the Romans So
This rock and these demesnes have been my world
More pious debts to heaven than in all
To him the other two shall minister
And we will fear no poison which attends
Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive
The roofs of palaces and nature prompts them
In simple and low things to prince it much
Beyond the trick of others This Polydore
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain who
The warlike feats I have done his spirits fly out
The princely blood flows in his cheek he sweats
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
That acts my words The younger brother Cadwal
Once Arviragus in as like a figure
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
O Cymbeline heaven and my conscience knows
Thou didst unjustly banish me Whereon
At three and two years old I stole these babes
Thinking to bar thee of succession as
Thou refts me of my lands Euriphile
Thou wast their nurse they took thee for their mother
And every day do honour to her grave
They take for natural father The game is up           Exit
SCENE IV
Wales near Milford Haven
Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN
To see me first as I have now Pisanio Man
Where is Posthumus What is in thy mind
That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh
Into a haviour of less fear ere wildness
May take off some extremity which to read
Would be even mortal to me
PISANIO Please you read
And you shall find me wretched man a thing
my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me I speak not
out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as
certain as I expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio must act
for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers Let
thine own hands take away her life I shall give thee opportunity
at Milford Haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if
thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art
PISANIO What shall I need to draw my sword The paper
Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue
Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath
Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
All corners of the world Kings queens and states
Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave
This viperous slander enters What cheer madam
IMOGEN False to his bed What is it to be false
To lie in watch there and to think on him
To weep twixt clock and clock If sleep charge nature
To break it with a fearful dream of him
Is it
PISANIO Alas good lady
IMOGEN I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency
Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion
By thy revolt O husband shall be thought
But worn a bait for ladies
PISANIO Good madam hear me
IMOGEN True honest men being heard like false Aeneas
Did scandal many a holy tear took pity
From most true wretchedness So thou Posthumus
Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men
From thy great fail Come fellow be thou honest
A little witness my obedience Look
I draw the sword myself take it and hit
The innocent mansion of my love my heart
Thy master is not there who was indeed
The riches of it Do his bidding strike
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause
PISANIO Hence vile instrument
Thou shalt not damn my hand
IMOGEN Why I must die
And if I do not by thy hand thou art
There is a prohibition so divine
Obedient as the scabbard What is here
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus
Corrupters of my faith you shall no more
Be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools
Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor
Stands in worse case of woe And thou Posthumus
My father and make me put into contempt the suits
Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find
It is no act of common passage but
A strain of rareness and I grieve myself
That now thou tirest on how thy memory
When I desire it too
PISANIO O gracious lady
I have not slept one wink
IMOGEN Wherefore then
So many miles with a pretence This place
Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far
PISANIO But to win time
To lose so bad employment in the which
Hear me with patience
I have heard I am a strumpet and mine ear
Therein false struck can take no greater wound
Nor tent to bottom that But speak
PISANIO Then madam
I thought you would not back again
Bringing me here to kill me
PISANIO Not so neither
But if I were as wise as honest then
My purpose would prove well It cannot be
Ay and singular in his art hath done you both
This cursed injury
IMOGEN Some Roman courtezan
PISANIO No on my life
And that will well confirm it
IMOGEN Why good fellow
What shall I do the while where bide how live
Or in my life what comfort when I am
Dead to my husband
IMOGEN No court no father nor no more ado
As fearful as a siege
PISANIO If not at court
Then not in Britain must you bide
IMOGEN Where then
Hath Britain all the sun that shines Day night
PISANIO I am most glad
LUCIUS the Roman comes to Milford Haven
Dark as your fortune is and but disguise
Pretty and full of view yea happily near
The residence of Posthumus so nigh at least
That though his actions were not visible yet
Report should render him hourly to your ear
As truly as he moves
IMOGEN O for such means
I would adventure
You must forget to be a woman change
The handmaids of all women or more truly
As quarrelous as the weasel Nay you must
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek
Your laboursome and dainty trims wherein
You made great Juno angry
IMOGEN Nay be brief
I see into thy end and am almost
A man already
PISANIO First make yourself but like one
That answer to them Would you in their serving
And with what imitation you can borrow
From youth of such a season fore noble Lucius
Present yourself desire his service tell him
If that his head have ear in music doubtless
You have me rich and I will never fail
Beginning nor supplyment
IMOGEN Thou art all the comfort
The gods will diet me with Prithee away
All that good time will give us This attempt
I am soldier to and will abide it with
PISANIO Well madam we must take a short farewell
Your carriage from the court My noble mistress
Here is a box I had it from the Queen
Will drive away distemper To some shade
And fit you to your manhood May the gods
Direct you to the best
IMOGEN Amen I thank thee                   Exeunt severally

His war for Britain
CYMBELINE Our expectation that it would be thus
Hath made us forward But my gentle queen
The duty of the day She looks us like
A thing more made of malice than of duty
We have noted it Call her before us for
We have been too slight in sufferance      Exit a MESSENGER
QUEEN Royal sir
Hath her life been the cure whereof my lord
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
And strokes death to her
CYMBELINE Where is she sir How
MESSENGER Please you sir
QUEEN My lord when last I went to visit her
She should that duty leave unpaid to you
Which daily she was bound to proffer This
Made me to blame in memory
Not seen of late Grant heavens that which I fear
Prove false                                            Exit

CLOTEN That man of hers Pisanio her old servant

QUEEN Go look after                             Exit CLOTEN
He hath a drug of mine I pray his absence
Proceed by swallowing that for he believes
It is a thing most precious But for her
To death or to dishonour and my end
Can make good use of either She being down
I have the placing of the British crown
How now my son
Go in and cheer the King He rages none
Dare come about him
QUEEN All the better May
This night forestall him of the coming day             Exit
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
Than lady ladies woman From every one
The best she hath and she of all compounded
Outsells them all I love her therefore but
Disdaining me and throwing favours on
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
I will conclude to hate her nay indeed
Enter PISANIO
Who is here What are you packing sirrah
Come hither Ah you precious pander Villain
Where is thy lady In a word or else
Thou art straightway with the fiends
PISANIO O good my lord
I will not ask again Close villain
Thy heart to find it Is she with Posthumus
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
A dram of worth be drawn
PISANIO Alas my lord
He is in Rome
CLOTEN Where is she sir Come nearer
No farther halting Satisfy me home
What is become of her
Discover where thy mistress is at once
Speak or thy silence on the instant is
Thy condemnation and thy death

May prove his travel not her danger
CLOTEN Humh
Safe mayst thou wander safe return again
CLOTEN Sirrah is this letter true
PISANIO Sir as I think

employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a
thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice
for thy preferment
PISANIO Well my good lord
CLOTEN Wilt thou serve me For since patiently and constantly thou
hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus thou
canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower
of mine Wilt thou serve me
PISANIO Sir I will
PISANIO I have my lord at my lodging the same suit he wore when
he took leave of my lady and mistress
CLOTEN The first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither Let

CLOTEN Meet thee at Milford Haven I forgot to ask him one thing

and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities
With that suit upon my back will I ravish her first kill him
and in her eyes There shall she see my valour which will then
be a torment to her contempt He on the ground my speech of
which as I say to vex her I will execute in the clothes that
revenge
Be those the garments
PISANIO Ay my noble lord
PISANIO She can scarce be there yet
CLOTEN Bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing
that I have commanded thee The third is that thou wilt be a
voluntary mute to my design Be but duteous and true preferment
shall tender itself to thee My revenge is now at Milford would
I had wings to follow it Come and be true            Exit
Were to prove false which I will never be

And find not her whom thou pursuest Flow flow
SCENE VI
Wales Before the cave of BELARIUS
Have made the ground my bed I should be sick
But that my resolution helps me Milford
Thou wast within a ken O Jove I think
Foundations fly the wretched such I mean
I could not miss my way Will poor folks lie
A punishment or trial Yes no wonder
When rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fulness
Is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood
Is worse in kings than beggars My dear lord
At point to sink for food But what is this
I were best not call I dare not call Yet famine
Plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever
Best draw my sword and if mine enemy
Such a foe good heavens                 Exit into the cave
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
Are master of the feast Cadwal and I
The sweat of industry would dry and die
But for the end it works to Come our stomachs
Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth
Finds the down pillow hard Now peace be here
GUIDERIUS I am thoroughly weary
ARVIRAGUS I am weak with toil yet strong in appetite
But that it eats our victuals I should think
Here were a fairy
BELARIUS By Jupiter an angel or if not
An earthly paragon Behold divineness
No elder than a boy
IMOGEN Good masters harm me not
I would have left it on the board so soon
As I had made my meal and parted
GUIDERIUS Money youth
ARVIRAGUS All gold and silver rather turn to dirt
Who worship dirty gods
Know if you kill me for my fault I should
Have died had I not made it
BELARIUS Whither bound
IMOGEN To Milford Haven
IMOGEN Fidele sir I have a kinsman who
To whom being going almost spent with hunger
BELARIUS Prithee fair youth
Think us no churls nor measure our good minds
Ere you depart and thanks to stay and eat it
Boys bid him welcome
GUIDERIUS Were you a woman youth
I should woo hard but be your groom In honesty
After long absence such is yours Most welcome
Been less and so more equal ballasting
To thee Posthumus
BELARIUS He wrings at some distress
What pain it cost what danger Gods
That had a court no bigger than this cave
That did attend themselves and had the virtue
BELARIUS It shall be so
So far as thou wilt speak it
GUIDERIUS Pray draw near
IMOGEN Thanks sir

beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time
above him in birth alike conversant in general services and
more remarkable in single oppositions Yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite What mortality is Posthumus thy
head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this
hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces
before her face and all this done spurn her home to her father

SCENE II
Wales Before the cave of BELARIUS
Enter from the cave BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS and IMOGEN
Are we not brothers
IMOGEN So man and man should be
But clay and clay differs in dignity
Whose dust is both alike I am very sick
IMOGEN So sick I am not yet I am not well
But not so citizen a wanton as
To seem to die ere sick So please you leave me
Stick to your journal course The breach of custom
Is breach of all I am ill but your being by me
Cannot amend me society is no comfort
To one not sociable I am not very sick
Since I can reason of it Pray you trust me here
Stealing so poorly
GUIDERIUS I love thee I have spoke it
How much the quantity the weight as much
As I do love my father
BELARIUS What how how
ARVIRAGUS If it be sin to say so sir I yoke me
I love this youth and I have heard you say
O worthiness of nature breed of greatness
Cowards father cowards and base things sire base
Nature hath meal and bran contempt and grace
ARVIRAGUS Brother farewell
IMOGEN I wish ye sport
heard
Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish
GUIDERIUS I could not stir him
He said he was gentle but unfortunate
Dishonestly afflicted but yet honest
ARVIRAGUS Thus did he answer me yet said hereafter
I might know more
BELARIUS Pray be not sick
For you must be our huswife
IMOGEN Well or ill
I am bound to you
BELARIUS And shalt be ever         Exit IMOGEN into the cave
Good ancestors
GUIDERIUS But his neat cookery He cut our roots in characters
And he her dieter
ARVIRAGUS Nobly he yokes
A smiling with a sigh as if the sigh
Was that it was for not being such a smile
The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly
From so divine a temple to commix
With winds that sailors rail at
GUIDERIUS I do note
That grief and patience rooted in him both
Mingle their spurs together
ARVIRAGUS Grow patience
And let the stinking elder grief untwine
His perishing root with the increasing vine
Enter CLOTEN
CLOTEN I cannot find those runagates that villain
BELARIUS Those runagates
I saw him not these many years and yet
GUIDERIUS He is but one you and my brother search
What companies are near Pray you away
Let me alone with him         Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS
CLOTEN Soft What are you
That fly me thus Some villain mountaineers
I have heard of such What slave art thou
GUIDERIUS A thing
CLOTEN Thou art a robber
GUIDERIUS To who To thee What art thou Have not I
An arm as big as thine a heart as big
Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not
My dagger in my mouth Say what thou art
Why I should yield to thee
CLOTEN Thou villain base
GUIDERIUS No nor thy tailor rascal
Who is thy grandfather he made those clothes
Which as it seems make thee
CLOTEN Thou precious varlet
My tailor made them not
GUIDERIUS Hence then and thank
The man that gave them thee Thou art some fool
I am loath to beat thee
CLOTEN Thou injurious thief
Hear but my name and tremble
CLOTEN Cloten thou villain
GUIDERIUS Cloten thou double villain be thy name
I cannot tremble at it Were it toad or adder spider
CLOTEN To thy further fear
Nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know
So worthy as thy birth
CLOTEN Art not afeard
At fools I laugh not fear them
CLOTEN Die the death
When I have slain thee with my proper hand
Yield rustic mountaineer                  Exeunt fighting
ARVIRAGUS None in the world you did mistake him sure
BELARIUS I cannot tell long is it since I saw him
Which then he wore the snatches in his voice
And burst of speaking were as his I am absolute
ARVIRAGUS In this place we left them
I wish my brother make good time with him
You say he is so fell
BELARIUS Being scarce made up
I mean to man he had not apprehension
Or roaring terrors for defect of judgment
Is oft the cease of fear
But see thy brother
GUIDERIUS This Cloten was a fool an empty purse
Yet I not doing this the fool had borne
My head as I do his
BELARIUS What hast thou done
Son to the Queen after his own report
BELARIUS We are all undone
GUIDERIUS Why worthy father what have we to lose
But that he swore to take our lives The law
Protects not us then why should we be tender
To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us
Play judge and executioner all himself
For we do fear the law What company
Discover you abroad
BELARIUS No single soul
Can we set eye on but in an safe reason
He must have some attendants Though his humour
To bring him here alone Although perhaps
It may be heard at court that such as we
Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time
As it is like him might break out and swear
To come alone either he so undertaking
Or they so suffering Then on good ground we fear
If we do fear this body hath a tail
More perilous than the head
ARVIRAGUS Let ordinance
My brother hath done well
BELARIUS I had no mind
Did make my way long forth
GUIDERIUS With his own sword
Behind our rock and let it to the sea
Becomes thee well enough
I love thee brotherly but envy much
That possible strength might meet would seek us through
And put us to our answer
Till hasty Polydore return and bring him
To dinner presently
ARVIRAGUS Poor sick Fidele
And praise myself for charity                          Exit
BELARIUS O thou goddess
In these two princely boys They are as gentle
As zephyrs blowing below the violet
Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough
That by the top doth take the mountain pine
That an invisible instinct should frame them
Civility not seen from other valour
That wildly grows in them but yields a crop
Or what his death will bring us
BELARIUS My ingenious instrument
Hark Polydore it sounds But what occasion
Hath Cadwal now to give it motion Hark
GUIDERIUS Is he at home
BELARIUS He went hence even now
It did not speak before All solemn things
Should answer solemn accidents The matter
Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
Is jollity for apes and grief for boys
Is Cadwal mad
her in his arms
BELARIUS Look here he comes
And brings the dire occasion in his arms
Of what we blame him for
ARVIRAGUS The bird is dead
That we have made so much on I had rather
Than have seen this
GUIDERIUS O sweetest fairest lily
My brother wears thee not the one half so well
BELARIUS O melancholy
Who ever yet could sound thy bottom find
The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare
Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I
Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy
How found you him
ARVIRAGUS Stark as you see
Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber
Reposing on a cushion
GUIDERIUS Where
My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness
GUIDERIUS Why he but sleeps
With female fairies will his tomb be haunted
And worms will not come to thee
ARVIRAGUS With fairest flowers
Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele
The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander
GUIDERIUS Prithee have done
Which is so serious Let us bury him
And not protract with admiration what
GUIDERIUS By good Euriphile our mother
And let us Polydore though now our voices
As once to our mother use like note and words
Save that Euriphile must be Fidele
GUIDERIUS Cadwal
For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
Than priests and fanes that lie
And though he came our enemy remember
He was paid for that Though mean and mighty rotting
And though you took his life as being our foe
Yet bury him as a prince
GUIDERIUS Pray you fetch him hither
When neither are alive
Exit BELARIUS
GUIDERIUS Come on then and remove him
ARVIRAGUS So Begin
SONG
Thou thy worldly task hast done
Golden lads and girls all must
Care no more to clothe and eat
To thee the reed is as the oak
The sceptre learning physic must
All follow this and come to dust
GUIDERIUS Fear no more the lightning flash
GUIDERIUS Fear not slander censure rash
BOTH      All lovers young all lovers must
Consign to thee and come to dust
GUIDERIUS No exorciser harm thee
ARVIRAGUS Nor no witchcraft charm thee
GUIDERIUS Ghost unlaid forbear thee
ARVIRAGUS Nothing ill come near thee
BOTH      Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
GUIDERIUS We have done our obsequies Come lay him down
These herblets shall which we upon you strew
Come on away Apart upon our knees
The ground that gave them first has them again
Their pleasures here are past so is their pain
Exeunt all but IMOGEN
I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither
But soft no bedfellow O gods and goddesses
Which the brain makes of fumes Our very eyes
Are sometimes like our judgments blind Good faith
I tremble still with fear but if there be
Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
A headless man The garments of Posthumus
His foot Mercurial his Martial thigh
All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks
And mine to boot be darted on thee Thou
Hath here cut off my lord To write and read
From this most bravest vessel of the world
And left this head on How should this be Pisanio
The drug he gave me which he said was precious
And cordial to me have I not found it
Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood
That we the horrider may seem to those
Which chance to find us O my lord my lord
Enter LUCIUS CAPTAINS and a SOOTHSAYER
You here at Milford Haven with your ships
They are in readiness
LUCIUS But what from Rome
And gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits
That promise noble service and they come
Under the conduct of bold Iachimo
LUCIUS When expect you them
LUCIUS This forwardness
Makes our hopes fair Command our present numbers
From the spongy south to this part of the west
Unless my sins abuse my divination
LUCIUS Dream often so
And never false Soft ho what trunk is here
Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime
It was a worthy building How a page
Or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather
For nature doth abhor to make his bed
With the defunct or sleep upon the dead
Inform us of thy fortunes for it seems
They crave to be demanded Who is this
That otherwise than noble nature did
IMOGEN I am nothing or if not
Nothing to be were better This was my master
A very valiant Briton and a good
That here by mountaineers lies slain Alas
There is no more such masters I may wander
From east to occident cry out for service
Try many all good serve truly never
Find such another master
Thy master in bleeding Say his name good friend
No harm by it though the gods hear I hope
LUCIUS Thy name
IMOGEN Fidele sir
LUCIUS Thou dost approve thyself the very same
Thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name
Wilt take thy chance with me I will not say
Sent by a consul to me should not sooner
Than thine own worth prefer thee Go with me
As these poor pickaxes can dig and when
And on it said a century of prayers
And leaving so his service follow you
So please you entertain me
LUCIUS Ay good youth
And rather father thee than master thee
My friends
The boy hath taught us manly duties let us
Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can
And make him with our pikes and partisans
As soldiers can Be cheerful wipe thine eyes
Some falls are means the happier to arise            Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter CYMBELINE LORDS PISANIO and attendants
Exit an attendant
A fever with the absence of her son
How deeply you at once do touch me Imogen
The great part of my comfort gone my queen
Upon a desperate bed and in a time
When fearful wars point at me her son gone
So needful for this present It strikes me past
The hope of comfort But for thee fellow
Who needs must know of her departure and
By a sharp torture
PISANIO Sir my life is yours
I humbly set it at your will but for my mistress
I nothing know where she remains why gone
Nor when she purposes return Beseech your Highness
Hold me your loyal servant
LORD Good my liege
The day that she was missing he was here
All parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten
There wants no diligence in seeking him
And will no doubt be found
CYMBELINE The time is troublesome
Does yet depend
LORD So please your Majesty
The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn
Are landed on your coast with a supply
Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent
CYMBELINE Now for the counsel of my son and queen
LORD Good my liege
Your preparation can affront no less
That long to move
And meet the time as it seeks us We fear not
What can from Italy annoy us but
We grieve at chances here Away      Exeunt all but PISANIO
PISANIO I heard no letter from my master since
Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
To yield me often tidings Neither know
What is betid to Cloten but remain
Wherein I am false I am honest not true to be true
These present wars shall find I love my country
SCENE IV
Wales Before the cave of BELARIUS
Enter BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
GUIDERIUS The noise is round about us
BELARIUS Let us from it
ARVIRAGUS What pleasure sir find we in life to lock it
From action and adventure
GUIDERIUS Nay what hope
Have we in hiding us This way the Romans
Must or for Britons slay us or receive us
For barbarous and unnatural revolts
During their use and slay us after
BELARIUS Sons
Which we have done whose answer would be death
Drawn on with torture
GUIDERIUS This is sir a doubt
In such a time nothing becoming you
Nor satisfying us
ARVIRAGUS It is not likely
That when they hear the Roman horses neigh
That they will waste their time upon our note
To know from whence we are
BELARIUS O I am known
Of many in the army Many years
Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him
From my remembrance And besides the King
Who find in my exile the want of breeding
The certainty of this hard life aye hopeless
The shrinking slaves of winter
GUIDERIUS Than be so
I and my brother are not known yourself
Cannot be questioned
ARVIRAGUS By this sun that shines
But that of coward hares hot goats and venison
Never bestrid a horse save one that had
To look upon the holy sun to have
The benefit of his blest beams remaining
So long a poor unknown
If you will bless me sir and give me leave
The hazard therefore due fall on me by
The hands of Romans
ARVIRAGUS So say I Amen
BELARIUS No reason I since of your lives you set
So slight a valuation should reserve
If in your country wars you chance to die
Till it fly out and show them princes born           Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Britain The Roman camp
Enter POSTHUMUS alone with a bloody handkerchief
If each of you should take this course how many
Must murder wives much better than themselves
For wrying but a little O Pisanio
Every good servant does not all commands
No bond but to do just ones Gods if you
The noble Imogen to repent and struck
Me wretch more worth your vengeance But alack
To have them fall no more You some permit
To second ills with ills each elder worse
But Imogen is your own Do your best wills
And make me blest to obey I am brought hither
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
For thee O Imogen even for whom my life
Is every breath a death And thus unknown
Pitied nor hated to the face of peril
More valour in me than my habits show
SCENE II
Britain A field of battle between the British and Roman camps
Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO and the Roman army at one door and the British army
at another LEONATUS POSTHUMUS following like a poor soldier
They march over and go out  Alarums  Then enter again in skirmish
IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS  He vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO
and then leaves him
IACHIMO The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
Takes off my manhood I have belied a lady
Revengingly enfeebles me or could this carl
In my profession Knighthoods and honours borne
As I wear mine are titles but of scorn
If that thy gentry Britain go before
This lout as he exceeds our lords the odds
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods            Exit
The battle continues the BRITONS fly CYMBELINE is taken
Then enter to his rescue BELARIUS GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
The lane is guarded nothing routs us but
The villainy of our fears
GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS Stand stand and fight
with IMOGEN
LUCIUS Away boy from the troops and save thyself
SCENE III
Another part of the field
Enter POSTHUMUS and a Britain LORD
POSTHUMUS I did
Though you it seems come from the fliers
LORD I did
POSTHUMUS No blame be to you sir for all was lost
But that the heavens fought The King himself
Of his wings destitute the army broken
And but the backs of Britons seen an flying
With dead men hurt behind and cowards living
LORD Where was this lane
So long a breeding as his white beard came to
The country base than to commit such slaughter
With faces fit for masks or rather fairer
Made good the passage cried to those that fled
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards Stand
Or we are Romans and will give you that
Like beasts which you shun beastly and may save
For three performers are the file when all
Accommodated by the place more charming
A distaff to a lance gilded pale looks
The way that they did and to grin like lions
A rout confusion thick Forthwith they fly
The strides they victors made and now our cowards
Like fragments in hard voyages became
Of the unguarded hearts heavens how they wound
Some slain before some dying some their friends
Are now each one the slaughterman of twenty
Those that would die or ere resist are grown
LORD This was strange chance
A narrow lane an old man and two boys
POSTHUMUS Nay do not wonder at it you are made
Rather to wonder at the things you hear
LORD Nay be not angry sir
You have put me into rhyme
POSTHUMUS Still going This is a lord O noble misery
Could not find death where I did hear him groan
Nor feel him where he struck Being an ugly monster
Sweet words or hath moe ministers than we
For being now a favourer to the Briton
The part I came in Fight I will no more
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
Once touch my shoulder Great the slaughter is
On either side I come to spend my breath
But end it by some means for Imogen
Enter two BRITISH CAPTAINS and soldiers
SECOND CAPTAIN There was a fourth man in a silly habit
POSTHUMUS A Roman
Who had not now been drooping here if seconds
SECOND CAPTAIN Lay hands on him a dog
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS PISANIO and Roman
captives The CAPTAINS present POSTHUMUS to CYMBELINE who delivers
him over to a gaoler Exeunt omnes
SCENE IV
Britain A prison
Enter POSTHUMUS and two GAOLERS
So graze as you find pasture
SECOND GAOLER Ay or a stomach                Exeunt GAOLERS
POSTHUMUS Most welcome bondage for thou art a way
I think to liberty Yet am I better
More than my shanks and wrists you good gods give me
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt
So children temporal fathers do appease
Gods are more full of mercy Must I repent
I cannot do it better than in gyves
No stricter render of me than my all
I know you are more clement than vile men
Who of their broken debtors take a third
A sixth a tenth letting them thrive again
If you will take this audit take this life
And cancel these cold bonds O Imogen
Solemn music Enter as in an apparition SICILIUS
LEONATUS father to POSTHUMUS an old man attired
like a warrior leading in his hand an ancient
matron his WIFE and mother to POSTHUMUS with
music before them Then after other music follows
the two young LEONATI brothers to POSTHUMUS
with wounds as they died in the wars
They circle POSTHUMUS round as he lies sleeping
Thy spite on mortal flies
With Mars fall out with Juno chide
That thy adulteries
Rates and revenges
Hath my poor boy done aught but well
Whose face I never saw
Whose father then as men report
Thou shouldst have been and shielded him
MOTHER   Lucina lent not me her aid
But took me in my throes
A thing of pity
SICILIUS Great Nature like his ancestry
Moulded the stuff so fair
FIRST BROTHER When once he was mature for man
In Britain where was he
That could stand up his parallel
Or fruitful object be
In eye of Imogen that best
Could deem his dignity
From Leonati seat and cast
From her his dearest one
Sweet Imogen
SICILIUS Why did you suffer Iachimo
Slight thing of Italy
To taint his nobler heart and brain
With needless jealousy
And to become the geck and scorn
SECOND BROTHER For this from stiller seats we came
Our parents and us twain
Fell bravely and were slain
With honour to maintain
FIRST BROTHER Like hardiment Posthumus hath
Then Jupiter thou king of gods
The graces for his merits due
SICILIUS Thy crystal window ope look out
No longer exercise
Upon a valiant race thy harsh
And potent injuries
MOTHER   Since Jupiter our son is good
Take off his miseries
SICILIUS Peep through thy marble mansion Help
Or we poor ghosts will cry
Against thy deity
BROTHERS Help Jupiter or we appeal
And from thy justice fly
upon an eagle He throws a thunderbolt The GHOSTS
fall on their knees
JUPITER No more you petty spirits of region low
Offend our hearing hush How dare you ghosts
Accuse the Thunderer whose bolt you know
Poor shadows of Elysium hence and rest
Be not with mortal accidents opprest
Whom best I love I cross to make my gift
His comforts thrive his trials well are spent
Our temple was he married Rise and fade
He shall be lord of Lady Imogen
And happier much by his affliction made
This tablet lay upon his breast wherein
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine
And so away no farther with your din
Express impatience lest you stir up mine
SICILIUS He came in thunder his celestial breath
Was sulpherous to smell the holy eagle
More sweet than our blest fields His royal bird
Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak
ALL Thanks Jupiter
His radiant roof Away and to be blest
A father to me and thou hast created
A mother and two brothers But O scorn
Gone They went hence so soon as they were born
And so I am awake Poor wretches that depend
Wake and find nothing But alas I swerve
Many dream not to find neither deserve
That have this golden chance and know not why
What fairies haunt this ground A book O rare one
Be not as is our fangled world a garment
Nobler than that it covers Let thy effects
So follow to be most unlike our courtiers
As good as promise
being dead many years shall after revive be jointed to the old
stock and freshly grow then shall Posthumus end his miseries
Tongue and brain not either both or nothing
Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
As sense cannot untie Be what it is
The action of my life is like it which
GAOLER Come sir are you ready for death
GAOLER Hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are
POSTHUMUS So if I prove a good repast to the spectators the dish
pays the shot
GAOLER A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort is you
shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills
which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth
You come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much
drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are
paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier
for being too light the purse too light being drawn of
heaviness O of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the
charity of a penny cord It sums up thousands in a trice You
to come the discharge Your neck sir is pen book and
counters so the acquittance follows
POSTHUMUS I am merrier to die than thou art to live
GAOLER Indeed sir he that sleeps feels not the toothache But a
man that were to sleep your sleep and a hangman to help him to
bed I think he would change places with his officer for look
you sir you know not which way you shall go
POSTHUMUS Yes indeed do I fellow
to know or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not
tell one
POSTHUMUS I tell thee fellow there are none want eyes to direct
them the way I am going but such as wink and will not use them
GAOLER What an infinite mock is this that a man should have the
the way of winking
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Knock off his manacles bring your prisoner to the King
POSTHUMUS Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler no bolts for the
dead                         Exeunt POSTHUMUS and MESSENGER
GAOLER Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets
I never saw one so prone Yet on my conscience there are verier
knaves desire to live for all he be a Roman and there be some
of them too that die against their wills so should I if I were
one I would we were all of one mind and one mind good O there
were desolation of gaolers and gallowses I speak against my
SCENE V
Enter CYMBELINE BELARIUS GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS PISANIO LORDS
OFFICERS and attendants
CYMBELINE Stand by my side you whom the gods have made
Preservers of my throne Woe is my heart
That the poor soldier that so richly fought
He shall be happy that can find him if
Our grace can make him so
BELARIUS I never saw
Such noble fury in so poor a thing
But beggary and poor looks
CYMBELINE No tidings of him
But no trace of him
CYMBELINE To my grief I am
which I will add
To you the liver heart and brain of Britain
To ask of whence you are Report it
BELARIUS Sir
In Cambria are we born and gentlemen
Further to boast were neither true nor modest
Unless I add we are honest
CYMBELINE Bow your knees
Companions to our person and will fit you
With dignities becoming your estates
Enter CORNELIUS and LADIES
Greet you our victory You look like Romans
CORNELIUS Hail great King
To sour your happiness I must report
The Queen is dead
CYMBELINE Who worse than a physician
Would this report become But I consider
Will seize the doctor too How ended she
CORNELIUS With horror madly dying like her life
Which being cruel to the world concluded
I will report so please you these her women
Can trip me if I err who with wet cheeks
CYMBELINE Prithee say
Affected greatness got by you not you
Married your royalty was wife to your place
CYMBELINE She alone knew this
And but she spoke it dying I would not
Believe her lips in opening it Proceed
CORNELIUS Your daughter whom she bore in hand to love
With such integrity she did confess
Was as a scorpion to her sight whose life
But that her flight prevented it she had
CYMBELINE O most delicate fiend
CORNELIUS More sir and worse She did confess she had
For you a mortal mineral which being took
By watching weeping tendance kissing to
When she had fitted you with her craft to work
But failing of her end by his strange absence
Of heaven and men her purposes repented
Despairing died
CYMBELINE Heard you all this her women
LADY We did so please your Highness
CYMBELINE Mine eyes
Were not in fault for she was beautiful
Mine ears that heard her flattery nor my heart
That thought her like her seeming It had been vicious
To have mistrusted her yet O my daughter
That it was folly in me thou mayst say
And prove it in thy feeling Heaven mend all
Enter LUCIUS IACHIMO the SOOTHSAYER and other
Roman prisoners guarded POSTHUMUS behind and IMOGEN
Of many a bold one whose kinsmen have made suit
Of you their captives which ourself have granted
So think of your estate
LUCIUS Consider sir the chance of war The day
Was yours by accident had it gone with us
Our prisoners with the sword But since the gods
Will have it thus that nothing but our lives
For my peculiar care This one thing only
I will entreat my boy a Briton born
A page so kind so duteous diligent
So tender over his occasions true
Cannot deny he hath done no Briton harm
And spare no blood beside
CYMBELINE I have surely seen him
His favour is familiar to me Boy
And art mine own I know not why wherefore
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt
Yea though thou do demand a prisoner
IMOGEN I humbly thank your Highness
LUCIUS I do not bid thee beg my life good lad
And yet I know thou wilt
IMOGEN No no Alack
Bitter to me as death your life good master
Must shuffle for itself
LUCIUS The boy disdains me
He leaves me scorns me Briefly die their joys
That place them on the truth of girls and boys
CYMBELINE What wouldst thou boy
I love thee more and more think more and more
Wilt have him live Is he thy kin thy friend
IMOGEN He is a Roman no more kin to me
Than I to your Highness who being born your vassal
Am something nearer
To give me hearing
CYMBELINE Ay with all my heart
IMOGEN Fidele sir
ARVIRAGUS One sand another
Who died and was Fidele What think you
GUIDERIUS The same dead thing alive
BELARIUS Peace peace see further He eyes us not forbear
He would have spoke to us
GUIDERIUS But we saw him dead
Since she is living let the time run on
CYMBELINE Come stand thou by our side
Give answer to this boy and do it freely
Or by our greatness and the grace of it
Which is our honour bitter torture shall
Winnow the truth from falsehood On speak to him
IMOGEN My boon is that this gentleman may render
Of whom he had this ring
CYMBELINE That diamond upon your finger say
How came it yours
Which to be spoke would torture thee
CYMBELINE How me
Which torments me to conceal By villainy
CYMBELINE All that belongs to this
IACHIMO That paragon thy daughter
For whom my heart drops blood and my false spirits
CYMBELINE My daughter What of her Renew thy strength
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
Than die ere I hear more Strive man and speak
What should I say he was too good to be
Where ill men were and was the best of all
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
Of him that best could speak for feature laming
Postures beyond brief nature for condition
A shop of all the qualities that man
Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving
CYMBELINE I stand on fire
Come to the matter
IACHIMO All too soon I shall
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus
Most like a noble lord in love and one
That had a royal lover took his hint
He spake of her as Dian had hot dreams
And she alone were cold whereat I wretch
By hers and mine adultery He true knight
No lesser of her honour confident
Than I did truly find her stakes this ring
And would so had it been a carbuncle
Post I in this design Well may you sir
Remember me at court where I was taught
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
Of hope not longing mine Italian brain
Gan in your duller Britain operate
Most vilely for my vantage excellent
To make the noble Leonatus mad
By wounding his belief in her renown
With tokens thus and thus averring notes
Of secret on her person that he could not
Italian fiend Ay me most credulous fool
Egregious murderer thief anything
To come O give me cord or knife or poison
Some upright justicer Thou King send out
For torturers ingenious It is I
By being worse than they I am Posthumus
Of virtue was she yea and she herself
Spit and throw stones cast mire upon me set
My queen my life my wife O Imogen
Imogen Imogen
IMOGEN Peace my lord Hear hear
PISANIO O gentlemen help
Mine and your mistress O my lord Posthumus
CYMBELINE Does the world go round
POSTHUMUS How comes these staggers on me
PISANIO Wake my mistress
CYMBELINE If this be so the gods do mean to strike me
To death with mortal joy
PISANIO How fares my mistress
IMOGEN O get thee from my sight
Breathe not where princes are
CYMBELINE The tune of Imogen
PISANIO Lady
The gods throw stones of sulphur on me if
That box I gave you was not thought by me
A precious thing I had it from the Queen
CYMBELINE New matter still
CORNELIUS O gods
To temper poisons for her still pretending
The satisfaction of her knowledge only
In killing creatures vile as cats and dogs
Of no esteem I dreading that her purpose
Was of more danger did compound for her
All offices of nature should again
IMOGEN Most like I did for I was dead
BELARIUS My boys
There was our error
GUIDERIUS This is sure Fidele
IMOGEN Why did you throw your wedded lady from you
Think that you are upon a rock and now
POSTHUMUS Hang there like fruit my soul
Till the tree die
CYMBELINE How now my flesh my child
Wilt thou not speak to me
youth I blame ye not
CYMBELINE My tears that fall
Prove holy water on thee Imogen
CYMBELINE O she was naught and long of her it was
That we meet here so strangely but her son
Is gone we know not how nor where
PISANIO My lord
It was my instant death By accident
Then in my pocket which directed him
To seek her on the mountains near to Milford
With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
I further know not
GUIDERIUS Let me end the story
I slew him there
CYMBELINE Marry the gods forfend
I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
Pluck a hard sentence Prithee valiant youth
GUIDERIUS I have spoke it and I did it
CYMBELINE He was a prince
GUIDERIUS A most incivil one The wrongs he did me
With language that would make me spurn the sea
And am right glad he is not standing here
To tell this tale of mine
CYMBELINE I am sorry for thee
IMOGEN That headless man
I thought had been my lord
CYMBELINE Bind the offender
And take him from our presence
BELARIUS Stay sir King
This man is better than the man he slew
As well descended as thyself and hath
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
They were not born for bondage
CYMBELINE Why old soldier
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for
By tasting of our wrath How of descent
As good as we
ARVIRAGUS In that he spake too far
BELARIUS We will die all three
As I have given out him My sons I must
For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech
Though haply well for you
GUIDERIUS And our good his
BELARIUS Have at it then by leave
Thou hadst great King a subject who
CYMBELINE What of him He is
BELARIUS He it is that hath
I know not how a traitor
CYMBELINE Take him hence
The whole world shall not save him
BELARIUS Not too hot
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons
And let it be confiscate all so soon
CYMBELINE Nursing of my sons
Ere I arise I will prefer my sons
Then spare not the old father Mighty sir
These two young gentlemen that call me father
And think they are my sons are none of mine
They are the issue of your loins my liege
And blood of your begetting
CYMBELINE How my issue
Your pleasure was my mere offence my punishment
Could put into them My breeding was sir as
Your Highness knows Their nurse Euriphile
Whom for the theft I wedded stole these children
For that which I did then Beaten for loyalty
Excited me to treason Their dear loss
Unto my end of stealing them But gracious sir
Here are your sons again and I must lose
The benediction of these covering heavens
Fall on their heads like dew for they are worthy
To inlay heaven with stars
The service that you three have done is more
If these be they I know not how to wish
A pair of worthier sons
This gentleman whom I call Polydore
Most worthy prince as yours is true Guiderius
This gentleman my Cadwal Arviragus
Of his queen mother which for more probation
I can with ease produce
CYMBELINE Guiderius had
Upon his neck a mole a sanguine star
It was a mark of wonder
BELARIUS This is he
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp
To be his evidence now
CYMBELINE O what am I
That after this strange starting from your orbs
You may reign in them now O Imogen
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom
IMOGEN No my lord
Have we thus met O never say hereafter
When I was but your sister I you brothers
When we were so indeed
ARVIRAGUS Ay my good lord
CYMBELINE O rare instinct
When shall I hear all through This fierce abridgment
Hath to it circumstantial branches which
And when came you to serve our Roman captive
How parted with your brothers how first met them
Why fled you from the court and whither These
And your three motives to the battle with
I know not how much more should be demanded
From chance to chance but nor the time nor place
Will serve our long interrogatories See
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen
And she like harmless lightning throws her eye
On him her brothers me her master hitting
Each object with a joy the counterchange
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices
IMOGEN You are my father too and did relieve me
To see this gracious season
Save these in bonds Let them be joyful too
For they shall taste our comfort
IMOGEN My good master
I will yet do you service
LUCIUS Happy be you
CYMBELINE The forlorn soldier that so nobly fought
The thankings of a king
POSTHUMUS I am sir
The soldier that did company these three
Speak Iachimo I had you down and might
Have made you finish
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee
As then your force did Take that life beseech you
Which I so often owe but your ring first
And here the bracelet of the truest princess
That ever swore her faith
POSTHUMUS Kneel not to me
The malice towards you to forgive you Live
And deal with others better
ARVIRAGUS You holp us sir
As you did mean indeed to be our brother
POSTHUMUS Your servant Princes Good my lord of Rome
Call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought
This label on my bosom whose containing
Is so from sense in hardness that I can
Make no collection of it Let him show
His skill in the construction
LUCIUS Philarmonus
SOOTHSAYER Here my good lord
LUCIUS Read and declare the meaning
a piece of tender air and when from a stately cedar shall
after revive be jointed to the old stock and freshly grow
then shall Posthumus end his miseries Britain be fortunate
The fit and apt construction of thy name
Is this most constant wife who even now
Answering the letter of the oracle
With this most tender air
CYMBELINE This hath some seeming
SOOTHSAYER The lofty cedar royal Cymbeline
Promises Britain peace and plenty
CYMBELINE Well
My peace we will begin And Caius Lucius
Although the victor we submit to Caesar
And to the Roman empire promising
To pay our wonted tribute from the which
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen
Whom heavens in justice both on her and hers
Have laid most heavy hand
The harmony of this peace The vision
Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke
From south to west on wing soaring aloft
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline
Which shines here in the west
CYMBELINE Laud we the gods
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
To all our subjects Set we forward let
A Roman and a British ensign wave
And in the temple of great Jupiter
Set on there Never was a war did cease

ACT I Scene I
Elsinore A platform before the Castle
Fran Nay answer me Stand and unfold yourself
Ber Long live the King
Fran Bernardo
Ber He
Fran You come most carefully upon your hour
And I am sick at heart
Ber Have you had quiet guard
Fran Not a mouse stirring
Ber Well good night
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus
The rivals of my watch bid them make haste
Enter Horatio and Marcellus
Fran I think I hear them Stand ho Who is there
Hor Friends to this ground
Mar And liegemen to the Dane
Fran Give you good night
Mar O farewell honest soldier
Fran Bernardo hath my place
Give you good night                                   Exit
Mar Holla Bernardo
What is Horatio there 
Hor A piece of him
Ber Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus
Ber I have seen nothing
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night
That if again this apparition come
He may approve our eyes and speak to it
Ber Sit down awhile
And let us once again assail your ears
That are so fortified against our story
What we two nights have seen
Hor Well sit we down
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this
Ber Last night of all
Where now it burns Marcellus and myself
Enter Ghost
Mar Peace break thee off Look where it comes again
Mar Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio
Ber Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio
Hor Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder
Ber It would be spoke to
Mar Question it Horatio
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak
Mar It is offended
Ber See it stalks away
Hor Stay Speak speak I charge thee speak
Exit Ghost
Ber How now Horatio You tremble and look pale
Is not this something more than fantasy
Hor Before my God I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes
Mar Is it not like the King
Hor As thou art to thyself
Such was the very armour he had on
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice
Mar Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch
Hor In what particular thought to work I know not
But in the gross and scope of my opinion
This bodes some strange eruption to our state
Mar Good now sit down and tell me he that knows
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And foreign mart for implements of war
Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week
What might be toward that this sweaty haste
Hor That can I
At least the whisper goes so Our last king
Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
Well ratified by law and heraldry
Did forfeit with his life all those his lands
Against the which a moiety competent
To the inheritance of Fortinbras
Had he been vanquisher as by the same comart
His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
Of unimproved mettle hot and full
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
For food and diet to some enterprise
As it doth well appear unto our state
But to recover of us by strong hand
And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands
So by his father lost and this I take it
Is the main motive of our preparations
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch so like the King
That was and is the question of these wars
In the most high and palmy state of Rome
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood
Disasters in the sun and the moist star
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse
And even the like precurse of fierce events
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climature and countrymen
Enter Ghost again
But soft behold Lo where it comes again
Spreads his arms
If thou hast any sound or use of voice
Speak to me
If there be any good thing to be done
That may to thee do ease and race to me
Speak to me
Which happily foreknowing may avoid
O speak
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
The cock crows
Mar Shall I strike at it with my partisan
Hor Do if it will not stand
Exit Ghost
We do it wrong being so majestical
To offer it the show of violence
For it is as the air invulnerable
And our vain blows malicious mockery
Ber It was about to speak when the cock crew
Hor And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons I have heard
The cock that is the trumpet to the morn
Awake the god of day and at his warning
Whether in sea or fire in earth or air
To his confine and of the truth herein
This present object made probation
Mar It faded on the crowing of the cock
The bird of dawning singeth all night long
And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad
The nights are wholesome then no planets strike
No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm
Hor So have I heard and do in part believe it
But look the morn in russet mantle clad
Break we our watch up and by my advice
Unto young Hamlet for upon my life
This spirit dumb to us will speak to him
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
As needful in our loves fitting our duty
Where we shall find him most conveniently           Exeunt
Scene II
Elsinore A room of state in the Castle
Lords Attendant
The memory be green and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
Together with remembrance of ourselves
Therefore our sometime sister now our queen
With an auspicious and a dropping eye
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage
In equal scale weighing delight and dole
Your better wisdoms which have freely gone
With this affair along For all our thanks
Now follows that you know young Fortinbras
Holding a weak supposal of our worth
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father with all bands of law
To our most valiant brother So much for him
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting
Thus much the business is we have here writ
To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras
Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears
His further gait herein in that the levies
The lists and full proportions are all made
Out of his subject and we here dispatch
You good Cornelius and you Voltemand
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the King more than the scope
Farewell and let your haste commend your duty
Cor Volt In that and all things will we show our duty
King We doubt it nothing Heartily farewell
Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes
That shall not be my offer not thy asking
The head is not more native to the heart
The hand more instrumental to the mouth
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father
What wouldst thou have Laertes
Laer My dread lord
Your leave and favour to return to France
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
To show my duty in your coronation
Yet now I must confess that duty done
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon
Pol He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition and at last
I do beseech you give him leave to go
King Take thy fair hour Laertes Time be thine
And thy best graces spend it at thy will
King How is it that the clouds still hang on you
Queen Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust
Passing through nature to eternity
Ham Ay madam it is common
Queen If it be
Why seems it so particular with thee
Nor customary suits of solemn black
No nor the fruitful river in the eye
Nor the dejected havior of the visage
Together with all forms moods shapes of grief
For they are actions that a man might play
These but the trappings and the suits of woe
To give these mourning duties to your father
But you must know your father lost a father
That father lost lost his and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow But to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven
A heart unfortified a mind impatient
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense
Why should we in our peevish opposition
A fault against the dead a fault to nature
To reason most absurd whose common theme
Is death of fathers and who still hath cried
This unprevailing woe and think of us
As of a father for let the world take note
You are the most immediate to our throne
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son
Do I impart toward you For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg
It is most retrograde to our desire
And we beseech you bend you to remain
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye
Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son
Queen Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet
I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg
Ham I shall in all my best obey you madam
Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come
Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell
Respeaking earthly thunder Come away
Flourish Exeunt all but Hamlet
Ham O that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew
How weary stale flat and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world
That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely That it should come to this
But two months dead Nay not so much not two
So excellent a king that was to this
Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth
Must I remember Why she would hang on him
As if increase of appetite had grown
A little month or ere those shoes were old
Than I to Hercules Within a month
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes
She married O most wicked speed to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets
It is not nor it cannot come to good
But break my heart for I must hold my tongue
Enter Horatio Marcellus and Bernardo
Hor Hail to your lordship
Ham I am glad to see you well
Hor The same my lord and your poor servant ever
And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio
Marcellus
Mar My good lord
But what in faith make you from Wittenberg
Hor A truant disposition good my lord
Ham I would not hear your enemy say so
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself I know you are no truant
But what is your affair in Elsinore
Ham I prithee do not mock me fellow student
Hor Indeed my lord it followed hard upon
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day Horatio
Hor O where my lord
Hor I saw him once He was a goodly king
Ham He was a man take him for all in all
I shall not look upon his like again
Hor My lord I think I saw him yesternight
Ham Saw who
Hor My lord the King your father
Ham The King my father
Hor Season your admiration for a while
With an attent ear till I may deliver
Upon the witness of these gentlemen
This marvel to you
Hor Two nights together had these gentlemen
In the dead vast and middle of the night
Appears before them and with solemn march
Almost to jelly with the act of fear
Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did
And I with them the third night kept the watch
Form of the thing each word made true and good
The apparition comes I knew your father
These hands are not more like
Ham But where was this
Ham Did you not speak to it
Hor My lord I did
But answer made it none Yet once methought
It lifted up it head and did address
Itself to motion like as it would speak
But even then the morning cock crew loud
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it
Ham Indeed indeed sirs But this troubles me
Ham From top to toe
Both My lord from head to foot
Ham Then saw you not his face
Hor O yes my lord He wore his beaver up
Hor A countenance more in sorrow than in anger
Ham Pale or red
Hor Nay very pale
Hor Most constantly
Ham I would I had been there
Hor While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred
Both Longer longer
Hor It was as I have seen it in his life
And bid me hold my peace I pray you all
Let it be tenable in your silence still
Give it an understanding but no tongue
I will requite your loves So fare you well
All Our duty to your honour
Ham Your loves as mine to you Farewell
I doubt some foul play Would the night were come
Till then sit still my soul Foul deeds will rise
Exit
Scene III
Elsinore A room in the house of Polonius
Enter Laertes and Ophelia
And sister as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant do not sleep
But let me hear from you
Oph Do you doubt that
Laer For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood
A violet in the youth of primy nature
The perfume and suppliance of a minute
No more
Oph No more but so
Laer Think it no more
For nature crescent does not grow alone
In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will but you must fear
For he himself is subject to his birth
He may not as unvalued persons do
Carve for himself for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
If with too credent ear you list his songs
Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open
Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister
And keep you in the rear of your affection
Out of the shot and danger of desire
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
If she unmask her beauty to the moon
Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes
The canker galls the infants of the spring
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent
Be wary then best safety lies in fear
Youth to itself rebels though none else near
As watchman to my heart But good my brother
Do not as some ungracious pastors do
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
And recks not his own rede
Laer O fear me not
Enter Polonius
I stay too long But here my father comes
A double blessing is a double grace
Occasion smiles upon a second leave
Pol Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue
Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar
Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of entrance to a quarrel but being in
Give every man thine ear but few thy voice
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy
For the apparel oft proclaims the man
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are most select and generous chief in that
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
For loan oft loses both itself and friend
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry
And it must follow as the night the day
Thou canst not then be false to any man
Farewell My blessing season this in thee
Laer Most humbly do I take my leave my lord
Pol The time invites you Go your servants tend
Laer Farewell Ophelia and remember well
What I have said to you
And you yourself shall keep the key of it
Laer Farewell                                          Exit
Oph So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet
Pol Marry well bethought
Given private time to you and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behooves my daughter and your honour
What is between you Give me up the truth
Oph He hath my lord of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me
Pol Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance
Do you believe his tenders as you call them
Oph I do not know my lord what I should think
Pol Marry I will teach you Think yourself a baby
Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly
In honourable fashion
Pol Ay fashion you may call it Go to go to
Oph And hath given countenance to his speech my lord
With almost all the holy vows of heaven
Pol Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know
When the blood burns how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows These blazes daughter
Giving more light than heat extinct in both
You must not take for fire From this time
Be something scanter of your maiden presence
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet
Believe so much in him that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you In few Ophelia
Do not believe his vows for they are brokers
Not of that dye which their investments show
But mere implorators of unholy suits
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds
The better to beguile This is for all
I would not in plain terms from this time forth
Have you so slander any moment leisure
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet
Oph I shall obey my lord
Exeunt
Scene IV
Elsinore The platform before the Castle
Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus
Ham The air bites shrewdly it is very cold
Hor It is a nipping and an eager air
Ham What hour now
Hor I think it lacks of twelve
Mar No it is struck
Hor Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk
A flourish of trumpets and two pieces go off
What does this mean my lord
And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge
Hor Is it a custom
But to my mind though I am native here
And to the manner born it is a custom
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition and indeed it takes
The pith and marrow of our attribute
So oft it chances in particular men
That for some vicious mole of nature in them
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason
The form of plausive manners that these men
Carrying I say the stamp of one defect
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Doth all the noble substance often dout To his own scandal
Enter Ghost
Hor Look my lord it comes
Ham Angels and ministers of grace defend us
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell
Be thy intents wicked or charitable
King father royal Dane O answer me
Let me not burst in ignorance but tell
Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre
To cast thee up again What may this mean
That thou dead corse again in complete steel
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon
Making night hideous and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls
Say why is this wherefore What should we do
Ghost beckons Hamlet
Hor It beckons you to go away with it
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone
Mar Look with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground
But do not go with it
Hor No by no means
Ham It will not speak Then will I follow it
Hor Do not my lord
Ham Why what should be the fear
And for my soul what can it do to that
Being a thing immortal as itself
Hor What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
And there assume some other horrible form
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness Think of it
The very place puts toys of desperation
Without more motive into every brain
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath
Ham It waves me still
Mar You shall not go my lord
Ham Hold off your hands
Ham My fate cries out
And makes each petty artire in this body
Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet
Hor He waxes desperate with imagination
Hor Have after To what issue wail this come
Mar Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Hor Heaven will direct it
Exeunt
Scene V
Elsinore The Castle Another part of the fortifications
Enter Ghost and Hamlet
Ghost Mark me
Ham I will
Ghost My hour is almost come
Must render up myself
Ham Alas poor ghost
Ghost Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold
Ham Speak I am bound to hear
Ghost So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear
Ham What
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
To tell the secrets of my prison house
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand an end
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood List list O list
Ham O God
Ghost Revenge his foul and most unnatural murther
Ham Murther
Ghost Murther most foul as in the best it is
But this most foul strange and unnatural
As meditation or the thoughts of love
May sweep to my revenge
Ghost I find thee apt
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf
Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear
A serpent stung me So the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Now wears his crown
Ham O my prophetic soul
My uncle
Ghost Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast
O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
From me whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage
But soft methinks I scent the morning air
Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard
My custom always of the afternoon
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd like eager droppings into milk
The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine
All my smooth body
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin
No reckoning made but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head
Ham O horrible O horrible most horrible
Ghost If thou hast nature in thee bear it not
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest
But howsoever thou pursuest this act
Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught Leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire
Adieu adieu adieu Remember me                      Exit
Ham O all you host of heaven O earth What else
And shall I couple hell Hold hold my heart
And you my sinews grow not instant old
But bear me stiffly up Remember thee
Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe Remember thee
Yea from the table of my memory
All saws of books all forms all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain
O most pernicious woman
O villain villain smiling damned villain
My tables Meet it is I set it down
That one may smile and smile and be a villain
So uncle there you are Now to my word
Enter Horatio and Marcellus
Mar Lord Hamlet
Hor Heaven secure him
Ham So be it
Mar Illo ho ho my lord
Ham Hillo ho ho boy Come bird come
Hor What news my lord
Mar O wonderful
Hor Good my lord tell it
Ham No you will reveal it
Hor Not I my lord by heaven
Mar Nor I my lord
Ham How say you then Would heart of man once think it
Both Ay by heaven my lord
Hor There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave
To tell us this
Ham Why right You are in the right
And so without more circumstance at all
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part
You as your business and desires shall point you
For every man hath business and desire
Such as it is and for my own poor part
Hor These are but wild and whirling words my lord
Ham I am sorry they offend you heartily
Yes faith heartily
Ham Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio
And much offence too Touching this vision here
It is an honest ghost that let me tell you
For your desire to know what is between us
As you are friends scholars and soldiers
Give me one poor request
Both My lord we will not
Hor In faith
My lord not I
Ham Upon my sword
Mar We have sworn my lord already
Ham Indeed upon my sword indeed
Ghost cries under the stage
Ghost Swear
Come on You hear this fellow in the cellarage
Consent to swear
Hor Propose the oath my lord
Ham Never to speak of this that you have seen
Swear by my sword
Come hither gentlemen
And lay your hands again upon my sword
Never to speak of this that you have heard
Swear by my sword
Hor O day and night but this is wondrous strange
Ham And therefore as a stranger give it welcome
There are more things in heaven and earth Horatio
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy
But come
Here as before never so help you mercy
That you at such times seeing me never shall
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase
Or such ambiguous giving out to note
So grace and mercy at your most need help you
Swear
Ham Rest rest perturbed spirit So gentlemen
With all my love I do commend me to you
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
God willing shall not lack Let us go in together
And still your fingers on your lips I pray
The time is out of joint O cursed spite
That ever I was born to set it right
Exeunt

Act II Scene I
Elsinore A room in the house of Polonius
Enter Polonius and Reynaldo
Pol Give him this money and these notes Reynaldo
Rey I will my lord
Before You visit him to make inquire
Of his behaviour
Rey My lord I did intend it
Pol Marry well said very well said Look you sir
Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris
And how and who what means and where they keep
What company at what expense and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it
Rey Ay very well my lord
What forgeries you please marry none so rank
But sir such wanton wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty
Rey As gaming my lord
Pol Ay or drinking fencing swearing quarrelling
Drabbing You may go so far
Rey My lord that would dishonour him
Pol Faith no as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him
That he is open to incontinency
That they may seem the taints of liberty
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind
A savageness in unreclaimed blood
Of general assault
Pol Wherefore should you do this
Rey Ay my lord
I would know that
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant
You laying these slight sullies on my son
Mark you
Your party in converse him you would sound
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
He closes with you in this consequence
According to the phrase or the addition
Rey Very good my lord
By the mass I was about to say something Where did I leave
Or then or then with such or such and as you say
Videlicet a brothel or so forth
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach
With windlasses and with assays of bias
By indirections find directions out
So by my former lecture and advice
Shall you my son You have me have you not
Rey My lord I have
Pol Observe his inclination in yourself
Rey I shall my lord
Pol And let him ply his music
Rey Well my lord
Pol Farewell
Exit Reynaldo
Enter Ophelia
Oph O my lord my lord I have been so affrighted
Oph My lord as I was sewing in my closet
Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
Pol Mad for thy love
Oph My lord I do not know
But truly I do fear it
Pol What said he
Oph He took me by the wrist and held me hard
Then goes he to the length of all his arm
He falls to such perusal of my face
At last a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being That done he lets me go
And to the last bended their light on me
Pol Come go with me I will go seek the King
This is the very ecstasy of love
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures I am sorry
What have you given him any hard words of late
Oph No my good lord but as you did command
I did repel his letters and denied
His access to me
Pol That hath made him mad
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
And meant to wrack thee but beshrew my jealousy
By heaven it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion Come go we to the King
This must be known which being kept close might move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love
Come
Exeunt
Scene II
Elsinore A room in the Castle
King Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Moreover that we much did long to see you
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending Something have you heard
Resembles that it was What it should be
I cannot dream of I entreat you both
That being of so young clays brought up with him
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures and to gather
So much as from occasion you may glean
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile
For the supply and profit of our hope
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
Ros Both your Majesties
Might by the sovereign power you have of us
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty
Guil But we both obey
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet
To be commanded
King Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern
Queen Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz
And I beseech you instantly to visit
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is
Guil Heavens make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him
Queen Ay amen
Enter Polonius
King Thou still hast been the father of good news
Pol Have I my lord Assure you my good liege
I hold my duty as I hold my soul
Both to my God and to my gracious king
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
King O speak of that That do I long to hear
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast
King Thyself do grace to them and bring them in
He tells me my dear Gertrude he hath found
Queen I doubt it is no other but the main
King Well we shall sift him
Enter Polonius Voltemand and Cornelius
Welcome my good friends
Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway
Volt Most fair return of greetings and desires
Upon our first he sent out to suppress
That so his sickness age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests
On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys
Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
Whereon old Norway overcome with joy
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee
And his commission to employ those soldiers
So levied as before against the Polack
With an entreaty herein further shown
That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down
King It likes us well
Answer and think upon this business
Most welcome home                       Exeunt Ambassadors
Pol This business is well ended
My liege and madam to expostulate
What majesty should be what duty is
Why day is day night is night and time is time
Were nothing but to waste night day and time
Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes
I will be brief Your noble son is mad
Mad call I it for to define true madness
But let that go
Queen More matter with less art
Pol Madam I swear I use no art at all
But farewell it for I will use no art
Mad let us grant him then And now remains
Or rather say the cause of this defect
For this effect defective comes by cause
Thus it remains and the remainder thus
Perpend
Who in her duty and obedience mark
Hath given me this Now gather and surmise
phrase
But you shall hear Thus
Queen Came this from Hamlet to her
Doubt that the sun doth move
Doubt truth to be a liar
But never doubt I love
reckon my groans but that I love thee best O most best believe
it Adieu
This in obedience hath my daughter shown me
And more above hath his solicitings
As they fell out by time by means and place
All given to mine ear
King But how hath she
Pol What do you think of me
King As of a man faithful and honourable
Pol I would fain prove so But what might you think
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
Or my dear Majesty your queen here think
Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb
What might you think No I went round to work
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak
That she should lock herself from his resort
Admit no messengers receive no tokens
Which done she took the fruits of my advice
And he repulsed a short tale to make
Fell into a sadness then into a fast
Thence to a watch thence into a weakness
Thence to a lightness and by this declension
Into the madness wherein now he raves
And all we mourn for
Queen it may be very like
King Not that I know
be otherwise
If circumstances lead me I will find
Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed
Within the centre
King How may we try it further
Pol You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby
Queen So he does indeed
Be you and I behind an arras then
Mark the encounter If he love her not
Let me be no assistant for a state
But keep a farm and carters
King We will try it
Enter Hamlet reading on a book
Queen But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading
Pol Away I do beseech you both away
How does my good Lord Hamlet
Pol Do you know me my lord
Ham Excellent well You are a fishmonger
Pol Not I my lord
Ham Then I would you were so honest a man
Pol Honest my lord
Ham Ay sir To be honest as this world goes is to be one man
Ham For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a god
Pol I have my lord
he knew me not at first He said I was a fishmonger He is far
read my lord
Ham Words words words
Pol What is the matter my lord
Ham Between who
Pol I mean the matter that you read my lord
Ham Slanders sir for the satirical rogue says here that old men
have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes
plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams All which
sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it
not honesty to have it thus set down for you yourself sir
should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward
Will You walk out of the air my lord
Ham Into my grave
his replies are a happiness that often madness hits on which
reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I
will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
my leave of you
Ham You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more
life
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Pol Fare you well my lord
Ham These tedious old fools
Pol You go to seek the Lord Hamlet There he is
Ros My most dear lord
Ham My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah
Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both
Ros As the indifferent children of the earth
Ham Nor the soles of her shoe
Ros Neither my lord
Ham Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her
favours
Guil Faith her privates we
Ham In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a
strumpet What news 
Ham Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me
question more in particular What have you my good friends
deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison
hither
Guil Prison my lord
Ros Then is the world one
Ham A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and
Ros We think not so my lord
or bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison
mind
Ham O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a
king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams
Guil Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of
the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream
Ham A dream itself is but a shadow
Ros Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
fay I cannot reason
Ham No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my
servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most
dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what
make you at Elsinore
Ros To visit you my lord no other occasion
Ham Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you
and sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were
you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free
visitation Come deal justly with me Come come Nay speak
Guil What should we say my lord
there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties
have not craft enough to colour I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you
Ros To what end my lord
Ham That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights
of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the
better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with
me whether you were sent for or no
not off
Guil My lord we were sent for
Ham I will tell you why So shall my anticipation prevent your
discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no
mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so
heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth
seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours What a
piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in
faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in
action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the
beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what
neither though by your smiling you seem to say so
Ros My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts
Ros To think my lord if you delight not in man what lenten
entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them
on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service
have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall
end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose
freely or the blank verse shall halt fort What players are
they
Ros Even those you were wont to take such delight in the
tragedians of the city
Ham How chances it they travel Their residence both in
reputation and profit was better both ways
Ros I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
innovation
Ham Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
Ros No indeed are they not
Ham How comes it Do they grow rusty
Ros Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is
sir an eyrie of children little eyases that cry out on the top
dare scarce come thither
escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
sing Will they not say afterwards if they should grow
against their own succession
Ros Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation
holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy There was for a
while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
went to cuffs in the question
Guil O there has been much throwing about of brains
Ham Do the boys carry it away
Ham It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and
those that would make mows at him while my father lived give
twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in
philosophy could find it out
Flourish for the Players
Guil There are the players
appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony Let me comply
Guil In what my dear lord
know a hawk from a handsaw
Enter Polonius
Pol Well be with you gentlemen
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
clouts
man is twice a child
You say right sir a Monday morning twas so indeed
Pol My lord I have news to tell you
Ham My lord I have news to tell you When Roscius was an actor in
Pol The actors are come hither my lord
Ham Buzz buzz
Pol The best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy
individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
Plautus too light For the law of writ and the liberty these are
the only men
Ham O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou
Pol What treasure had he my lord
Ham Why
Pol If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I
love passing well
Ham Nay that follows not
Pol What follows then my lord
Ham Why
and then you know
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more for look
where my abridgment comes
Enter four or five Players
ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the
altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a piece of
taste of your quality Come a passionate speech
1 Play What speech my good lord
Ham I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted
set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said
there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury
nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of
Black as his purpose did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse
With heraldry more dismal Head to foot
With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons
That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus
So proceed you
Pol Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good
discretion
Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword
Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls
Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top
Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash
Which was declining on the milky head
So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood
And like a neutral to his will and matter
Did nothing
But as we often see against some storm
A silence in the heavens the rack stand still
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork
Now falls on Priam
Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods
In general synod take away her power
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven
As low as to the fiends
Pol This is too long
Hecuba
With bisson rheum a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood and for a robe
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
The instant burst of clamour that she made
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
eyes Prithee no more
chronicles of the time After your death you were better have a
bad epitaph than their ill report while you live
Pol My lord I will use them according to their desert
desert and who should scape whipping Use them after your own
honour and dignity The less they deserve the more merit is in
your bounty Take them in
Pol Come sirs
1 Play Ay my lord
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
1 Play Ay my lord
Elsinore
Ros Good my lord
Now I am alone
O what a rogue and peasant slave am I
Is it not monstrous that this player here
But in a fiction in a dream of passion
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
A broken voice and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit And all for nothing
For Hecuba
That he should weep for her What would he do
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech
Make mad the guilty and appal the free
Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears
Yet I
And can say nothing No not for a king
Upon whose property and most dear life
Who calls me villain breaks my pate across
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face
As deep as to the lungs Who does me this ha
To make oppression bitter or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain
O vengeance
Why what an ass am I This is most brave
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell
A scullion
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
For murther though it have no tongue will speak
Play something like the murther of my father
I know my course The spirit that I have seen
May be a devil and the devil hath power
Out of my weakness and my melancholy
As he is very potent with such spirits

ACT III Scene I
Elsinore A room in the Castle
Enter King Queen Polonius Ophelia Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Lords
King And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy
Ros He does confess he feels himself distracted
But from what cause he will by no means speak
Guil Nor do we find him forward to be sounded
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state
Queen Did he receive you well
Ros Most like a gentleman
Guil But with much forcing of his disposition
Ros Niggard of question but of our demands
Most free in his reply
Queen Did you assay him
To any pastime
Ros Madam it so fell out that certain players
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it They are here about the court
And as I think they have already order
This night to play before him
To hear and see the matter
King With all my heart and it doth much content me
Good gentlemen give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights
Ros We shall my lord
Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
King Sweet Gertrude leave us too
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither
Affront Ophelia
Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen
We may of their encounter frankly judge
That thus he suffers for
Queen I shall obey you
And for your part Ophelia I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Will bring him to his wonted way again
To both your honours
Oph Madam I wish it may
That show of such an exercise may colour
The Devil himself
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word
O heavy burthen
Enter Hamlet
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil
That makes calamity of so long life
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The insolence of office and the spurns
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin Who would these fardels bear
To grunt and sweat under a weary life
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all
And thus the native hue of resolution
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
Oph Good my lord
How does your honour for this many a day
Ham I humbly thank you well well well
Oph My lord I have remembrances of yours
I pray you now receive them
Ham No not I
I never gave you aught
As made the things more rich Their perfume lost
Take these again for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind
There my lord
Ham Ha ha Are you honest
Oph My lord
Ham Are you fair
Oph What means your lordship
Ham That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty
Oph Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty
Ham Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox
but now the time gives it proof I did love you once
Oph Indeed my lord you made me believe so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you
not
Oph I was the more deceived
Ham Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me
I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my
beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give
them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I
do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves all
father
Oph At home my lord
Ham Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool
Oph O help him you sweet heavens
be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape
calumny Get thee to a nunnery Go farewell Or if thou wilt
needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what
monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too
Farewell
Oph O heavenly powers restore him
Ham I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath
given you one face and you make yourselves another You jig you
me mad I say we will have no moe marriages Those that are
they are To a nunnery go                            Exit
The glass of fashion and the mould of form
And I of ladies most deject and wretched
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason
Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh
Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me
Enter King and Polonius
King Love his affections do not that way tend
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger which for to prevent
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down he shall with speed to England
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Pol It shall do well But yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said
But if you hold it fit after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief Let her be round with him
Of all their conference If she find him not
To England send him or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think
King It shall be so
Scene II
Elsinore hall in the Castle
Enter Hamlet and three of the Players
trippingly on the tongue But if you mouth it as many of our
players do I had as live the town crier spoke my lines Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all
whirlwind of your passion you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the
tatters to very rags to split the cars of the groundlings who
Player I warrant your honour
Ham Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your
tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with
nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing
whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as
scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his
form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though
it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious
grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance
Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so
journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated
humanity so abominably
Ham O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns
speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them
that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren
spectators to laugh too though in the mean time some necessary
and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go
make you ready
Exeunt Players
Enter Polonius Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
How now my lord Will the King hear this piece of work
Pol And the Queen too and that presently
help to hasten them
Both We will my lord                       Exeunt they two
Ham What ho Horatio
Enter Horatio
Hor Here sweet lord at your service
Hor O my dear lord
Ham Nay do not think I flatter
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
No let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning Dost thou hear
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish her election
Hath scald thee for herself For thou hast been
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
To sound what stop she please Give me that man
As I do thee Something too much of this I
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
I prithee when thou seest that act afoot
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe my uncle If his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech
It is a damned ghost that we have seen
And my imaginations are as foul
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming
Hor Well my lord
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing
And scape detecting I will pay the theft
Guildenstern and other Lords attendant with the Guard
carrying torches
Ham They are coming to the play I must be idle
Get you a place
King How fares our cousin Hamlet
King I have nothing with this answer Hamlet These words are not
mine
Pol That did I my lord and was accounted a good actor
Ham What did you enact
Ham It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there Be
the players ready
Ros Ay my lord They stay upon your patience
Queen Come hither my dear Hamlet sit by me
Ham Lady shall I lie in your lap
Oph No my lord
Ham I mean my head upon your lap
Oph Ay my lord
Ham Do you think I meant country matters
Oph I think nothing my lord
Oph What is my lord
Ham Nothing
Oph You are merry my lord
Ham Who I
Oph Ay my lord
For look you how cheerfully my mother looks and my father died
suit of sables O heavens die two months ago and not forgotten
Hautboys play The dumb show enters
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly the Queen embracing
him and he her She kneels and makes show of protestation
unto him He takes her up and declines his head upon her
neck He lays him down upon a bank of flowers She seeing
him asleep leaves him Anon comes in a fellow takes off his
leaves him The Queen returns finds the King dead and makes
passionate action The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes
comes in again seem to condole with her The dead body is
carried away The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts she
seems harsh and unwilling awhile but in the end accepts
his love
Exeunt
Oph What means this my lord
Ham Marry this is miching malhecho it means mischief
Oph Belike this show imports the argument of the play
Enter Prologue
Ham We shall know by this fellow The players cannot keep counsel
Oph Will he tell us what this show meant
Pro For us and for our tragedy
Here stooping to your clemency
Ham Is this a prologue or the posy of a ring
And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite comutual in most sacred bands
Queen So many journeys may the sun and moon
But woe is me you are so sick of late
So far from cheer and from your former state
That I distrust you Yet though I distrust
Discomfort you my lord it nothing must
In neither aught or in extremity
Now what my love is proof hath made you know
Where love is great the littlest doubts are fear
Where little fears grow great great love grows there
King Faith I must leave thee love and shortly too
My operant powers their functions leave to do
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind
Queen O confound the rest
Such love must needs be treason in my breast
When second husband let me be accurst
None wed the second but who killed the first
Queen The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift but none of love
A second time I kill my husband dead
When second husband kisses me in bed
King I do believe you think what now you speak
But what we do determine oft we break
Purpose is but the slave to memory
Of violent birth but poor validity
Which now like fruit unripe sticks on the tree
But fill unshaken when they mellow be
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt
What to ourselves in passion we propose
The passion ending doth the purpose lose
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy
Where joy most revels grief doth most lament
Grief joys joy grieves on slender accident
That even our loves should with our fortunes change
Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love
The great man down you mark his favourite flies
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend
For who not needs shall never lack a friend
And who in want a hollow friend doth try
Directly seasons him his enemy
But orderly to end where I begun
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown
Our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own
So think thou wilt no second husband wed
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead
Queen Nor earth to me give food nor heaven light
Sport and repose lock from me day and night
To desperation turn my trust and hope
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife
If once a widow ever I be wife
Ham If she should break it now
My spirits grow dull and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep
Queen Sleep rock thy brain
And never come mischance between us twain
Exit
Ham Madam how like you this play
Queen The lady doth protest too much methinks
world
King What do you call the play
are unwrung
Enter Lucianus
This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
Oph You are as good as a chorus my lord
Ham I could interpret between you and your love if I could see
the puppets dallying
Oph You are keen my lord you are keen
Ham It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge
Oph Still better and worse
thy damnable faces and begin Come the croaking raven doth
bellow for revenge
Luc Thoughts black hands apt drugs fit and time agreeing
Confederate season else no creature seeing
Thou mixture rank of midnight weeds collected
Thy natural magic and dire property
On wholesome life usurp immediately
Pours the poison in his ears
The story is extant and written in very choice Italian You
Oph The King rises
Ham What frighted with false fire
Queen How fares my lord
King Give me some light Away
All Lights lights lights
Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio
Ham   Why let the strucken deer go weep
The hart ungalled play
For some must watch while some must sleep
Thus runs the world away
shoes get me a fellowship in a cry of players sir
Hor Half a share
Ham   A whole one I
For thou dost know O Damon dear
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself and now reigns here
pound Didst perceive
Hor Very well my lord
Ham Upon the talk of the poisoning
Hor I did very well note him
Ham   Aha Come some music Come the recorders
For if the King like not the comedy
Why then belike he likes it not perdy
Come some music
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Guil Good my lord vouchsafe me a word with you
Ham Sir a whole history
Ham Ay sir what of him
Ham With drink sir
Guil No my lord rather with choler
Ham Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
the doctor for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
plunge him into far more choler
Guil Good my lord put your discourse into some frame and start
not so wildly from my affair
Ham I am tame sir pronounce
Guil The Queen your mother in most great affliction of spirit
hath sent me to you
Ham You are welcome
Guil Nay good my lord this courtesy is not of the right breed
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer I will do
shall be the end of my business
Ham Sir I cannot
Guil What my lord
answer is I can make you shall command or rather as you say
my mother Therefore no more but to the matter My mother you
Ros Then thus she says your behaviour hath struck her into
amazement and admiration
Ham O wonderful son that can so stonish a mother But is there no
Ros She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed
Ham We shall obey were she ten times our mother Have you any
further trade with us
Ros My lord you once did love me
Ham And do still by these pickers and stealers
Ros Good my lord what is your cause of distemper You do surely
bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
your friend
Ham Sir I lack advancement
Ros How can that be when you have the voice of the King himself
for your succession in Denmark
musty
Enter the Players with recorders
you go about to recover the wind of me as if you would drive me
into a toil
Guil O my lord if my duty be too bold my love is too unmannerly
Ham I do not well understand that Will you play upon this pipe
Guil My lord I cannot
Ham I pray you
Guil Believe me I cannot
Ham I do beseech you
Guil I know no touch of it my lord
Ham It is as easy as lying Govern these ventages with your
fingers and thumbs give it breath with your mouth and it will
discourse most eloquent music Look you these are the stops
have not the skill
Ham Why look you now how unworthy a thing you make of me You
would play upon me you would seem to know my stops you would
pluck out the heart of my mystery you would sound me from my
lowest note to the top of my compass and there is much music
excellent voice in this little organ yet cannot you make it
pipe Call me what instrument you will though you can fret me
you cannot play upon me
Enter Polonius
God bless you sir
Pol My lord the Queen would speak with you and presently
Ham Methinks it is like a weasel
Ham Or like a whale
Pol Very like a whale
Pol I will say so                                      Exit
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world Now could I drink hot blood
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on Soft now to my mother
O heart lose not thy nature let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom
Let me be cruel not unnatural
I will speak daggers to her but use none
How in my words somever she be shent
To give them seals never my soul consent             Exit
Scene III
A room in the Castle
Enter King Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
King I like him not nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range Therefore prepare you
I your commission will forthwith dispatch
And he to England shall along with you
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies
Guil We will ourselves provide
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your Majesty
Ros The single and peculiar life is bound
With all the strength and armour of the mind
To keep itself from noyance but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
The lives of many The cesse of majesty
Dies not alone but like a gulf doth draw
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Each small annexment petty consequence
Did the king sigh but with a general groan
For we will fetters put upon this fear
Both We will haste us
Exeunt Gentlemen
Enter Polonius
And as you said and wisely was it said
The speech of vantage Fare you well my liege
And tell you what I know
King Thanks dear my lord
O my offence is rank it smells to heaven
Though inclination be as sharp as will
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
And like a man to double business bound
I stand in pause where I shall first begin
And both neglect What if this cursed hand
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence
To be forestalled ere we come to fall
My fault is past But O what form of prayer
My crown mine own ambition and my queen
In the corrupted currents of this world
There is no shuffling there the action lies
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults
To give in evidence What then What rests
Try what repentance can What can it not
Yet what can it when one cannot repent
O wretched state O bosom black as death
O limed soul that struggling to be free
Bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel
All may be well                                  He kneels
Enter Hamlet
Ham Now might I do it pat now he is praying
A villain kills my father and for that
I his sole son do this same villain send
To heaven
Why this is hire and salary not revenge
He took my father grossly full of bread
With all his crimes broad blown as flush as May
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven
But in our circumstance and course of thought
To take him in the purging of his soul
When he is fit and seasoned for his passage
Up sword and know thou a more horrid hent
When he is drunk asleep or in his rage
At gaming swearing or about some act
Then trip him that his heels may kick at heaven
As hell whereto it goes My mother stays
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days              Exit
Words without thoughts never to heaven go             Exit
Scene IV
Enter Queen and Polonius
Pol He will come straight Look you lay home to him
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with
Pray you be round with him
Enter Hamlet
Queen Hamlet thou hast thy father much offended
Ham Mother you have my father much offended
Queen Come come you answer with an idle tongue
Ham Go go you question with a wicked tongue
Queen Why how now Hamlet
Queen Have you forgot me
Ham No by the rood not so
Ham Come come and sit you down You shall not budge I
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you
Queen What wilt thou do Thou wilt not murther me
Help help ho
Queen O me what hast thou done
Ham Nay I know not Is it the King
Queen O what a rash and bloody deed is this
As kill a king and marry with his brother
Queen As kill a king
Ham Ay lady it was my word
Thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell
I took thee for thy better Take thy fortune
Leave wringing of your hinds Peace sit you down
And let me wring your heart for so I shall
If it be made of penetrable stuff
That it is proof and bulwark against sense
In noise so rude against me
Ham Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty
Calls virtue hypocrite takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there makes marriage vows
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul and sweet religion makes
Yea this solidity and compound mass
With tristful visage as against the doom
Queen Ay me what act
That roars so loud and thunders in the index
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers
See what a grace was seated on this brow
An eye like Mars to threaten and command
A station like the herald Mercury
A combination and a form indeed
Where every god did seem to set his seal
To give the world assurance of a man
This was your husband Look you now what follows
Blasting his wholesome brother Have you eyes
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed
And batten on this moor Ha have you eyes
You cannot call it love for at your age
And waits upon the judgment and what judgment
Would step from this to this Sense sure you have
Else could you not have motion but sure that sense
Eyes without feeling feeling without sight
Ears without hands or eyes smelling sans all
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope
O shame where is thy blush Rebellious hell
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
And melt in her own fire Proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will
Queen O Hamlet speak no more
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct
Ham Nay but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed
Over the nasty sty
Queen O speak to me no more
These words like daggers enter in mine ears
No more sweet Hamlet
Ham A murtherer and a villain
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord a vice of kings
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
And put it in his pocket
Queen No more
Enter the Ghost in his nightgown
You heavenly guards What would your gracious figure
Ham Do you not come your tardy son to chide
O say
Ghost Do not forget This visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose
But look amazement on thy mother sits
O step between her and her fighting soul
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works
Speak to her Hamlet
Ham How is it with you lady
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep
Your bedded hairs like life in excrements
Start up and stand an end O gentle son
Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience Whereon do you look
Ham On him on him Look you how pale he glares
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects Then what I have to do
Queen To whom do you speak this
Ham Do you see nothing there
Queen Nothing at all yet all that is I see
Ham Nor did you nothing hear
Queen No nothing but ourselves
Ham Why look you there Look how it steals away
Look where he goes even now out at the portal
Exit Ghost
Queen This is the very coinage of your brain
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in
Ham Ecstasy
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
And makes as healthful music It is not madness
And I the matter will reword which madness
Would gambol from Mother for love of grace
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
That not your trespass but my madness speaks
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place
Whiles rank corruption mining all within
Infects unseen Confess yourself to heaven
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
To make them ranker Forgive me this my virtue
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Yea curb and woo for leave to do him good
Queen O Hamlet thou hast cleft my heart in twain
Ham O throw away the worser part of it
And live the purer with the other half
Assume a virtue if you have it not
That monster custom who all sense doth eat
Of habits evil is angel yet in this
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence the next more easy
For use almost can change the stamp of nature
With wondrous potency Once more good night
And when you are desirous to be blest
To punish me with this and this with me
That I must be their scourge and minister
I will bestow him and will answer well
The death I gave him So again good night
I must be cruel only to be kind
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind
One word more good lady
Queen What shall I do
Ham Not this by no means that I bid you do
Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed
Pinch wanton on your cheek call you his mouse
And let him for a pair of reechy kisses
Make you to ravel all this matter out
That I essentially am not in madness
Would from a paddock from a bat a gib
Such dear concernings hide Who would do so
No in despite of sense and secrecy
Let the birds fly and like the famous ape
To try conclusions in the basket creep
And break your own neck down
And breath of life I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me
Ham I must to England you know that
Queen Alack
They bear the mandate they must sweep my way
And marshal me to knavery Let it work
But I will delve one yard below their mines
When in one line two crafts directly meet
This man shall set me packing
Is now most still most secret and most grave
Who was in life a foolish peating knave
Come sir to draw toward an end with you
Good night mother
Polonius

ACT IV Scene I
Elsinore A room in the Castle
Enter King and Queen with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Where is your son
Queen Bestow this place on us a little while
King What Gertrude How does Hamlet
Queen Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Which is the mightier In his lawless fit
Behind the arras hearing something stir
And in this brainish apprehension kills
The unseen good old man
King O heavy deed
It had been so with us had we been there
To you yourself to us to every one
It will be laid to us whose providence
This mad young man But so much was our love
We would not understand what was most fit
But like the owner of a foul disease
To keep it from divulging let it feed
Even on the pith of life Where is he gone
Among a mineral of metals base
Shows itself pure He weeps for what is done
King O Gertrude come away
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
But we will ship him hence and this vile deed
We must with all our majesty and skill
Both countenance and excuse Ho Guildenstern
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Friends both go join you with some further aid
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain
Go seek him out speak fair and bring the body
Into the chapel I pray you haste in this
And let them know both what we mean to do
As level as the cannon to his blank
My soul is full of discord and dismay
Exeunt
Scene II
Elsinore A passage in the Castle
Enter Hamlet
Ham But soft What noise Who calls on Hamlet O here they come
Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Ros What have you done my lord with the dead body
And bear it to the chapel
Ham Do not believe it
Ros Believe what
Ham That I can keep your counsel and not mine own Besides to be
demanded of a sponge what replication should be made by the son
of a king
Ros Take you me for a sponge my lord
his authorities But such officers do the King best service in
the end He keeps them like an ape in the corner of his jaw
again
Ros I understand you not my lord
Ham I am glad of it A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear
Ros My lord you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
the King
Ham The body is with the King but the King is not with the body
Guil A thing my lord
Ham Of nothing Bring me to him Hide fox and all after
Exeunt
Scene III
Elsinore A room in the Castle
Enter King
King I have sent to seek him and to find the body
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose
Yet must not we put the strong law on him
Who like not in their judgment but their eyes
But never the offence To bear all smooth and even
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause Diseases desperate grown
Or not at all
Enter Rosencrantz
We cannot get from him
King But where is he
Ros Without my lord guarded to know your pleasure
King Bring him before us
Ros Ho Guildenstern Bring in my lord
Ham At supper
King At supper Where
Ham Not where he eats but where he is eaten A certain
only emperor for diet We fat all creatures else to fat us and
we fat ourselves for maggots Your fat king and your lean beggar
end
King Alas alas
Ham A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king and eat
of the fish that hath fed of that worm
King What dost thou mean by this
Ham Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
the guts of a beggar
King Where is Polonius
Ham In heaven Send thither to see If your messenger find him not
find him not within this month you shall nose him as you go up
the stair into the lobby
Ham He will stay till you come
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
With fiery quickness Therefore prepare thyself
The bark is ready and the wind at help
For England
Ham For England
King Ay Hamlet
Ham Good
Ham I see a cherub that sees them But come for England
Farewell dear mother
King Thy loving father Hamlet
Ham My mother Father and mother is man and wife man and wife is
one flesh and so my mother Come for England
Exit
King Follow him at foot tempt him with speed aboard
As my great power thereof may give thee sense
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword and thy free awe
Our sovereign process which imports at full
By letters congruing to that effect
The present death of Hamlet Do it England
For like the hectic in my blood he rages

Scene IV
Near Elsinore
Enter Fortinbras with his Army over the stage
For Go Captain from me greet the Danish king
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
Over his kingdom You know the rendezvous
if that his Majesty would aught with us
We shall express our duty in his eye
And let him know so
For Go softly on
Ham Good sir whose powers are these
Capt They are of Norway sir
Capt Against some part of Poland
Ham Who commands them sir
Capt The nephew to old Norway Fortinbras
Ham Goes it against the main of Poland sir
Or for some frontier
Capt Truly to speak and with no addition
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name
To pay five ducats five I would not farm it
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate should it be sold in fee
Ham Why then the Polack never will defend it
Ham Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw
That inward breaks and shows no cause without
How all occasions do inform against me
And spur my dull revenge What is a man
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed A beast no more
Sure he that made us with such large discourse
Looking before and after gave us not
That capability and godlike reason
Bestial oblivion or some craven scruple
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince
Makes mouths at the invisible event
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune death and danger dare
Even for an eggshell Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
Excitements of my reason and my blood
And let all sleep while to my shame I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
That for a fantasy and trick of fame
Go to their graves like beds fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain O from this time forth
My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth            Exit

Scene V
Elsinore A room in the Castle
Enter Horatio Queen and a Gentleman
Queen I will not speak with her
Gent She is importunate indeed distract
Her mood will needs be pitied
Queen What would she have
Gent She speaks much of her father says she hears
Spurns enviously at straws speaks things in doubt
That carry but half sense Her speech is nothing
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection they aim at it
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts
Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them
Indeed would make one think there might be thought
Though nothing sure yet much unhappily
Queen Let her come in
Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt
Enter Ophelia distracted
Oph Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark
Queen How now Ophelia
From another one
And his sandal shoon
Queen Alas sweet lady what imports this song
Oph Say you Nay pray You mark
He is dead and gone
At his heels a stone
O ho
Oph Pray you mark
Enter King
Queen Alas look here my lord
Larded all with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did not go
King How do you pretty lady
Lord we know what we are but know not what we may be God be at
your table
King Conceit upon her father
it means say you this
All in the morning bedtime
And I a maid at your window
To be your Valentine
Let in the maid that out a maid
Never departed more
King Pretty Ophelia
Alack and fie for shame
By Cock they are to blame
He answers
King How long hath she been thus
Oph I hope all will be well We must be patient but I cannot
My brother shall know of it and so I thank you for your good
counsel Come my coach Good night ladies Good night sweet
ladies Good night good night                         Exit
King Follow her close give her good watch I pray you
O this is the poison of deep grief it springs
When sorrows come they come not single spies
But in battalions First her father slain
Next Your son gone and he most violent author
Of his own just remove the people muddied
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts
Last and as such containing as all these
Her brother is in secret come from France
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
Feeds on his wonder keep himself in clouds
Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
In ear and ear O my dear Gertrude this
Give me superfluous death                  A noise within
Queen Alack what noise is this
King Where are my Switzers Let them guard the door
Enter a Messenger
What is the matter
Mess Save Yourself my lord
The ocean overpeering of his list
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than Young Laertes in a riotous head
And as the world were now but to begin
Antiquity forgot custom not known
The ratifiers and props of every word
Caps hands and tongues applaud it to the clouds
A noise within
Queen How cheerfully on the false trail they cry
O this is counter you false Danish dogs
King The doors are broke
Enter Laertes with others
Laer I pray you give me leave
All We will we will
O thou vile king
Give me my father
Queen Calmly good Laertes
Cries cuckold to my father brands the harlot
Even here between the chaste unsmirched brows
Of my true mother
King What is the cause Laertes
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike
Let him go Gertrude Do not fear our person
That treason can but peep to what it would
Acts little of his will Tell me Laertes
Speak man
Laer Where is my father
King Dead
Queen But not by him
King Let him demand his fill
To hell allegiance vows to the blackest devil
Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit
I dare damnation To this point I stand
That both the world I give to negligence
Most throughly for my father
King Who shall stay you
Laer My will not all the world
They shall go far with little
King Good Laertes
If you desire to know the certainty
That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe
Winner and loser
Laer None but his enemies
King Will you know them then
Repast them with my blood
King Why now You speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman
And am most sensibly in grief for it
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye
Laer How now What noise is that
Enter Ophelia
O heat dry up my brains Tears seven times salt
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye
By heaven thy madness shall be paid by weight
Till our scale turn the beam O rose of May
Dear maid kind sister sweet Ophelia
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves
Fare you well my dove
Laer Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge
It could not move thus
how the wheel becomes it It is the false steward that stole his
Laer A document in madness Thoughts and remembrance fitted
died They say he made a good end
Laer Thought and affliction passion hell itself
She turns to favour and to prettiness
And will he not come again
And will he not come again
No no he is dead
Go to thy deathbed
He never will come again
His beard was as white as snow
All flaxen was his poll
He is gone he is gone
And we cast away moan
Exit
Laer Do you see this O God
King Laertes I must commune with your grief
Or you deny me right Go but apart
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will
If by direct or by collateral hand
Our crown our life and all that we call ours
To you in satisfaction but if not
Be you content to lend your patience to us
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content
Laer Let this be so
King So you shall
I pray you go with me
Exeunt

Elsinore Another room in the Castle
Enter Horatio with an Attendant
Hor What are they that would speak with me
Servant Seafaring men sir They say they have letters for you
Hor Let them come in
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted if not from Lord Hamlet
Enter Sailors
Sailor God bless you sir
Hor Let him bless thee too
your name be Horatio as I am let to know it is
this give these fellows some means to the King They have
letters for him Ere we were two days old at sea a pirate of
very warlike appointment gave us chase Finding ourselves too
slow of sail we put on a compelled valour and in the grapple I
boarded them On the instant they got clear of our ship so I
alone became their prisoner They have dealt with me like thieves
of mercy but they knew what they did I am to do a good turn for
them Let the King have the letters I have sent and repair thou
to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death I have words
to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb yet are they much too
light for the bore of the matter These good fellows will bring
thee where I am Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
for England Of them I have much to tell thee Farewell
Come I will give you way for these your letters
To him from whom you brought them                   Exeunt

Scene VII
Elsinore Another room in the Castle
Enter King and Laertes
King Now must your conscience my acquittance seal
And You must put me in your heart for friend
Sith you have heard and with a knowing ear
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life
Laer It well appears But tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats
So crimeful and so capital in nature
As by your safety wisdom all things else
King O for two special reasons
But yet to me they are strong The Queen his mother
That as the star moves not but in his sphere
I could not but by her The other motive
Why to a public count I might not go
Is the great love the general gender bear him
Who dipping all his faults in their affection
Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone
Convert his gives to graces so that my arrows
Would have reverted to my bow again
Laer And so have I a noble father lost
Whose worth if praises may go back again
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections But my revenge will come
King Break not your sleeps for that You must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime You shortly shall hear more
Enter a Messenger with letters
How now What news
Mess Letters my lord from Hamlet
This to your Majesty this to the Queen
King From Hamlet Who brought them
Mess Sailors my lord they say I saw them not
Of him that brought them
King Laertes you shall hear them
Leave us
Exit Messenger
occasion of my sudden and more strange return
What should this mean Are all the rest come back
Or is it some abuse and no such thing
Laer Know you the hand
Can you advise me
Laer I am lost in it my lord But let him come
It warms the very sickness in my heart
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth
King If it be so Laertes
Laer Ay my lord
As checking at his voyage and that he means
No more to undertake it I will work him
To exploit now ripe in my device
Under the which he shall not choose but fall
And for his death no wind
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
And call it accident
The rather if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ
King It falls right
Wherein they say you shine Your sun of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one and that in my regard
Of the unworthiest siege
Laer What part is that my lord
Yet needfull too for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Thin settled age his sables and his weeds
Importing health and graveness Two months since
Here was a gentleman of Normandy
And they can well on horseback but this gallant
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
Come short of what he did
King A Norman
Laer Upon my life Lamound
King The very same
Laer I know him well He is the broach indeed
And gem of all the nation
King He made confession of you
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially
If one could match you The scrimers of their nation
He swore had neither motion guard nor eye
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Laer What out of this my lord
King Laertes was your father dear to you
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
Laer Why ask you this
King Not that I think you did not love your father
But that I know love is begun by time
And that I see in passages of proof
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it
And nothing is at a like goodness still
For goodness growing to a plurisy
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues are hands are accidents
Hamlet comes back What would you undertake
More than in words
King No place indeed should murther sanctuarize
Revenge should have no bounds But good Laertes
Will you do this Keep close within your chamber
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads He being remiss
Most generous and free from all contriving
Will not peruse the foils so that with ease
Or with a little shuffling you may choose
A sword unbated and in a pass of practice
Requite him for your father
I bought an unction of a mountebank
So mortal that but dip a knife in it
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon can save the thing from death
With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
It may be death
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape If this should fall
And that our drift look through our bad performance
Should have a back or second that might hold
If this did blast in proof Soft let me see
A chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping
Enter Queen
How now sweet queen
Queen There is a willow grows aslant a brook
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crowflowers nettles daisies and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name
There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook Her clothes spread wide
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes
As one incapable of her own distress
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element but long it could not be
Till that her garments heavy with their drink
To muddy death
Laer Too much of water hast thou poor Ophelia
And therefore I forbid my tears but yet
It is our trick nature her custom holds
Let shame say what it will When these are gone
The woman will be out Adieu my lord
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze
But that this folly douts it                          Exit
How much I had to do to calm his rage I
Now fear I this will give it start again

Clown It must be se offendendo it cannot be else For here lies
the point if I drown myself wittingly it argues an act and an
Other Nay but hear you Goodman Delver
Clown Give me leave Here lies the water good Here stands the
man good If the man go to this water and drown himself it is
him and drown him he drowns not himself Argal he that is not
guilty of his own death shortens not his own life
Other But is this law
Other Was he a gentleman
Other Why he had none
Clown What art a heathen How dost thou understand the Scripture
put another question to thee If thou answerest me not to the
Other Go to
Clown What is he that builds stronger than either the mason the
shipwright or the carpenter
tenants
Clown I like thy wit well in good faith The gallows does well
But how does it well It does well to those that do ill Now
thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
Other Who builds stronger than a mason a shipwright or a
carpenter
Clown Ay tell me that and unyoke
Other Marry now I can tell
Other Mass I cannot tell
Enter Hamlet and Horatio afar off
Clown Cudgel thy brains no more about it for your dull ass will
till doomsday Go get thee to Yaughan fetch me a stoup of
liquor
In youth when I did love did love
Methought it was very sweet
Ham Has this fellow no feeling of his business that he sings at
Hor Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness
sense
But age with his stealing steps
Hath clawed me in his clutch
And hath shipped me intil the land
As if I had never been such
Ham That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once How the
did the first murther This might be the pate of a Politician
might it not
Hor It might my lord
it not
Hor Ay my lord
A pickaxe and a spade a spade
For and a shrouding sheet
O a Pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet
Where be his quiddits now his quillets his cases his tenures
and his tricks Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
him about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell him
great buyer of land with his statutes his recognizances his
fines his double vouchers his recoveries Is this the fine of
his fines and the recovery of his recoveries to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt Will his vouchers vouch him no more of
his purchases and double ones too than the length and breadth
of a pair of indentures The very conveyances of his lands will
more ha
Hor Not a jot more my lord
Ham Is not parchment made of sheepskins
Hor Ay my lord And of calveskins too
Ham They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that I
Clown Mine sir
For such a guest is meet
the dead not for the quick therefore thou liest
Ham What man dost thou dig it for
Clown For no man sir
Ham What woman then
Clown For none neither
Ham How absolute the knave is We must speak by the card or
equivocation will undo us By the Lord Horatio this three years
I have taken note of it the age is grown so picked that the toe
of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls
last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras
Ham How long is that since
Clown Cannot you tell that Every fool can tell that It was the
into England
Ham Ay marry why was be sent into England
Ham Why
Ham How came he mad
Clown Very strangely they say
Ham How strangely
Ham Upon what ground
Clown Why here in Denmark I have been sexton here man and boy
thirty years
will last you some eight year or nine year A tanner will last
you nine year
Ham Why he more than another
keep out water a great while and your water is a sore decayer of
Ham Whose was it
Ham Nay I know not
Ham This
Horatio A fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy He
hath borne me on his back a thousand tunes And now how abhorred
in my imagination it is My gorge rises at it Here hung those
now your gambols your songs your flashes of merriment that
were wont to set the table on a roar Not one now to mock your
chamber and tell her let her paint an inch thick to this
favour she must come Make her laugh at that Prithee Horatio
tell me one thing
Ham And smelt so Pah
Ham To what base uses we may return Horatio Why may not
imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
stopping a bunghole
Ham No faith not a jot but to follow him thither with modesty
enough and likelihood to lead it as thus Alexander died
Alexander was buried Alexander returneth into dust the dust is
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away
O that that earth which kept the world in awe
The Queen the courtiers Who is this they follow
And with such maimed rites This doth betoken
Couch we awhile and mark
Laer What ceremony else
Ham That is Laertes
A very noble youth Mark
Laer What ceremony else
As we have warranty Her death was doubtful
Till the last trumpet For charitable prayers
Shards flints and pebbles should be thrown on her
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial
Laer Must there no more be done
Priest No more be done
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring I tell thee churlish priest
When thou liest howling
Ham What the fair Ophelia
Queen Sweets to the sweet Farewell
Laer O treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms
Leaps in the grave
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
Of blue Olympus
Bears such an emphasis whose phrase of sorrow
Laer The devil take thy soul
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat
For though I am not splenitive and rash
Yet have I in me something dangerous
Which let thy wisdom fear Hold off thy hand
King Pluck thein asunder
Queen Hamlet Hamlet
All Gentlemen
Hor Good my lord be quiet
Ham Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag
Queen O my son what theme
Make up my sum What wilt thou do for her
King O he is mad Laertes
Queen For love of God forbear him
To outface me with leaping in her grave
Be buried quick with her and so will I
And if thou prate of mountains let them throw
Millions of acres on us till our ground
Singeing his pate against the burning zone
Queen This is mere madness
And thus a while the fit will work on him
Anon as patient as the female dove
His silence will sit drooping
Ham Hear you sir
What is the reason that you use me thus
Let Hercules himself do what he may
The cat will mew and dog will have his day
Exit
King I pray thee good Horatio wait upon him
Exit Horatio
This grave shall have a living monument
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see
Till then in patience our proceeding be
Exeunt
Scene II
Elsinore A hall in the Castle
Enter Hamlet and Horatio
Ham So much for this sir now shall you see the other
You do remember all the circumstance
Hor Remember it my lord
Ham Sir in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep Methought I lay
Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
When our deep plots do pall and that should learn us
Hor That is most certain
Ham Up from my cabin
To mine own room again making so bold
Their grand commission where I found Horatio
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
That on the supervise no leisure bated
No not to stay the finding of the axe
My head should be struck off
But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed
Hor I beseech you
Ham Being thus benetted round with villanies
Or I could make a prologue to my brains
They had begun the play I sat me down
I once did hold it as our statists do
How to forget that learning but sir now
Hor Ay good my lord
Ham An earnest conjuration from the King
As England was his faithful tributary
As love between them like the palm might flourish
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
That on the view and knowing of these contents
Without debatement further more or less
He should the bearers put to sudden death
Ham Why even in that was heaven ordinant
which was the model of that Danish seal
The changeling never known Now the next day
Ham Why man they did make love to this employment
They are not near my conscience their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites
Hor Why what a king is this
Thrown out his angle for my Proper life
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil
Hor It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there
Ham It will be short the interim is mine
But I am very sorry good Horatio
That to Laertes I forgot myself
For by the image of my cause I see
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
Hor Peace Who comes here
Enter young Osric a courtier
Osr Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark
waterfly
vice to know him He hath much land and fertile Let a beast be
a chough but as I say spacious in the possession of dirt
Osr Sweet lord if your lordship were at leisure I should impart
a thing to you from his Majesty
Ham I will receive it sir with all diligence of spirit Put your
Osr I thank your lordship it is very hot
Osr It is indifferent cold my lord indeed
Ham But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion
tell how But my lord his Majesty bade me signify to you that
Ham I beseech you remember
Osr Nay good my lord for mine ease in good faith Sir here is
newly come to court Laertes believe me an absolute gentleman
full of most excellent differences of very soft society and
great showing Indeed to speak feelingly of him he is the card
or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of
what part a gentleman would see
Ham Sir his definement suffers no perdition in you though I
memory and yet but yaw neither in respect of his quick sail
But in the verity of extolment I take him to be a soul of great
article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as to make
true diction of him his semblable is his mirror and who else
would trace him his umbrage nothing more
Osr Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him
Ham The concernancy sir Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
rawer breath
Osr Sir
Ham What imports the nomination of this gentleman
Osr Of Laertes
spent
Ham Of him sir
Ham I would you did sir yet in faith if you did it would not
much approve me Well sir
Ham I dare not confess that lest I should compare with him in
excellence but to know a man well were to know himself
Osr I mean sir for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him
Osr Rapier and dagger
rapiers and poniards with their assigns as girdle hangers and
so Three of the carriages in faith are very dear to fancy
very responsive to the hilts most delicate carriages and of
very liberal conceit
Ham What call you the carriages
ere you had done
Osr The carriages sir are the hangers
Ham The phrase would be more germane to the matter if we could
carry cannon by our sides I would it might be hangers till then
But on Six Barbary horses against six French swords their
Osr The King sir hath laid that in a dozen passes between
yourself and him he shall not exceed you three hits he hath
laid on twelve for nine and it would come to immediate trial
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer
Ham How if I answer no
Osr I mean my lord the opposition of your person in trial
Ham Sir I will walk here in the hall If it please his Majesty
it is the breathing time of day with me Let the foils be
brought the gentleman willing and the King hold his purpose
I will win for him if I can if not I will gain nothing but my
shame and the odd hits
Ham To this effect sir after what flourish your nature will
Osr I commend my duty to your lordship
Hor This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head
and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes
a kind of yesty collection which carries them through and
Enter a Lord
Lord My lord his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric who
brings back to him that you attend him in the hall He sends to
know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will
take longer time
If his fitness speaks mine is ready now or whensoever provided
I be so able as now
Lord The King and Queen and all are coming down
Ham In happy time
Lord The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
Laertes before you fall to play
Ham She well instructs me
Hor You will lose this wager my lord
Ham I do not think so Since he went into France I have been in
continual practice I shall win at the odds But thou wouldst not
Ham It is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
would perhaps trouble a woman
Hor If your mind dislike anything obey it I will forestall their
repair hither and say you are not fit
not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come
the readiness is all Since no man knows aught of what he leaves
Enter King Queen Laertes Osric and Lords with other
Attendants with foils and gauntlets
A table and flagons of wine on it
King Come Hamlet come and take this hand from me
Ham Give me your pardon sir I have done you wrong
This presence knows
With sore distraction What I have done
That might your nature honour and exception
Roughly awake I here proclaim was madness
If Hamlet from himself be taken away
Then Hamlet does it not Hamlet denies it
Sir in this audience
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
And hurt my brother
Laer I am satisfied in nature
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
To my revenge But in my terms of honour
I stand aloof and will no reconcilement
Till by some elder masters of known honour
I have a voice and precedent of peace
And will not wrong it
Ham I embrace it freely
Give us the foils Come on
Laer Come one for me
Stick fiery off indeed
Laer You mock me sir
Ham No by this bad
King Give them the foils young Osric Cousin Hamlet
You know the wager
Ham Very well my lord
King I do not fear it I have seen you both
Laer This is too heavy let me see another
Ham This likes me well These foils have all a length
Prepare to play
Osr Ay my good lord
King Set me the stoups of wine upon that table
If Hamlet give the first or second hit
Or quit in answer of the third exchange
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire
And in the cup an union shall he throw
Richer than that which four successive kings
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak
The trumpet to the cannoneer without
The cannons to the heavens the heaven to earth
And you the judges bear a wary eye
Ham Come on sir
Laer Come my lord                                They play
Ham One
Laer No
Ham Judgment
Osr A hit a very palpable hit
Laer Well again
King Stay give me drink Hamlet this pearl is thine
Give him the cup
King Our son shall win
Here Hamlet take my napkin rub thy brows
The Queen carouses to thy fortune Hamlet
Ham Good madam
King Gertrude do not drink
Queen I will my lord I pray you pardon me          Drinks
Queen Come let me wipe thy face
Ham Come for the third Laertes You but dally
pray You Pass with your best violence
I am afeard You make a wanton of me
Laer Say you so Come on                               Play
Osr Nothing neither way
Laer Have at you now
Ham Nay come again                         The Queen falls
Osr Look to the Queen there ho
Hor They bleed on both sides How is it my lord
Laer Why as a woodcock to mine own springe Osric
Ham How does the Queen
King She sounds to see them bleed
Queen No no the drink the drink O my dear Hamlet
Treachery Seek it out
Laer It is here Hamlet Hamlet thou art slain
No medicine in the world can do thee good
In thee there is not half an hour of life
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand
Then venom to thy work                    Hurts the King
All Treason treason
King O yet defend me friends I am but hurt
Drink off this potion Is thy union here
Follow my mother                                 King dies
Exchange forgiveness with me noble Hamlet
Nor thine on me                                       Dies
Ham Heaven make thee free of it I follow thee
I am dead Horatio Wretched queen adieu
You that look pale and tremble at this chance
That are but mutes or audience to this act
But let it be Horatio I am dead
To the unsatisfied
Hor Never believe it
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane
O good Horatio what a wounded name
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain
What warlike noise is this
Osr Young Fortinbras with conquest come from Poland
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley
Ham O I die Horatio
I cannot live to hear the news from England
On Fortinbras He has my dying voice
Hor Now cracks a noble heart Good night sweet prince
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest
Why does the drum come hither
Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassadors with Drum
Colours and Attendants
Fort Where is this sight
Hor What is it you will see
If aught of woe or wonder cease your search
Fort This quarry cries on havoc O proud Death
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck
Ambassador The sight is dismal
And our affairs from England come too late
The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead
Where should We have our thanks
Hor Not from his mouth
He never gave commandment for their death
But since so jump upon this bloody question
You from the Polack wars and you from England
High on a stage be placed to the view
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about So shall You hear
Of carnal bloody and unnatural acts
Of accidental judgments casual slaughters
And in this upshot purposes mistook
Truly deliver
Fort Let us haste to hear it
And call the noblest to the audience
For me with sorrow I embrace my fortune
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me
Hor Of that I shall have also cause to speak
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more
On plots and errors happen
Fort Let four captains
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage
For he was likely had he been put on
Speak loudly for him
Take up the bodies Such a sight as this
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss
Go bid the soldiers shoot
Exeunt marching after the which a peal of ordnance
are shot off

ACT I Scene I
London The Palace
Enter the King Lord John of Lancaster Earl of Westmoreland
King So shaken as we are so wan with care
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
No more shall trenching war channel her fields
Of hostile paces Those opposed eyes
Which like the meteors of a troubled heaven
All of one nature of one substance bred
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Against acquaintance kindred and allies
No more shall cut his master Therefore friends
Whose soldier now under whose blessed cross
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
For our advantage on the bitter cross
But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old
Therefore we meet not now Then let me hear
Of you my gentle cousin Westmoreland
What yesternight our Council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience
West My liege this haste was hot in question
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news
Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken
A thousand of his people butchered
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse
Such beastly shameless transformation
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of
King It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the North and thus it did import
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald
At Holmedon met
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
As by discharge of their artillery
And shape of likelihood the news was told
For he that brought them in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse
Uncertain of the issue any way
Sir Walter Blunt new lighted from his horse
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited
Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
To beaten Douglas and the Earl of Athol
Of Murray Angus and Menteith
And is not this an honourable spoil
A gallant prize Ha cousin is it not
West In faith
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Amongst a grove the very straightest plant
Whilst I by looking on the praise of him
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
In cradle clothes our children where they lay
Then would I have his Harry and he mine
But let him from my thoughts What think you coz
To his own use he keeps and sends me word
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife
Malevolent to you In all aspects
Which makes him prune himself and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity
King But I have sent for him to answer this
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem
Cousin on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor So inform the lords
But come yourself with speed to us again
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered
West I will my liege                                 Exeunt
Scene II
Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff
Fal Now Hal what time of day is it lad
unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after
noon that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou
wouldest truly know What a devil hast thou to do with the time
of the day Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons
and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of leaping
houses and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in
superfluous to demand the time of the day
Fal Indeed you come near me now Hal for we that take purses go
by the moon And the seven stars and not by Phoebus he that
Prince What none
Fal No by my troth not so much as will serve to be prologue to
an egg and butter
Prince Well how then Come roundly roundly
Fal Marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that
Minions of the Moon and let men say we be men of good
government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste
mistress the moon under whose countenance we steal
Prince Thou sayest well and it holds well too for the fortune of
governed as the sea is by the moon As for proof now a purse
of the gallows
the tavern a most sweet wench
a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
Fal How now how now mad wag What in thy quips and thy
quiddities What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin
Prince Why what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern
Prince Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part
Prince Yea and elsewhere so far as my coin would stretch and
where it would not I have used my credit
gallows standing in England when thou art king and resolution
law Do not thou when thou art king hang a thief
Prince No thou shalt
Prince Thou judgest false already I mean thou shalt have the
hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman
Fal Well Hal well and in some sort it jumps with my humour as
well as waiting in the court I can tell you
Prince For obtaining of suits
Fal Yea for obtaining of suits whereof the hangman hath no lean
bear
Fal Yea or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe
Prince What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor
Ditch
Fal Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most
comparative rascalliest sweet young prince But Hal I prithee
trouble me no more with vanity I would to God thou and I knew
where a commodity of good names were to be bought An old lord of
the Council rated me the other day in the street about you sir
too
Prince Thou didst well for wisdom cries out in the streets and
no man regards it
Fal O thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to
forgive thee for it Before I knew thee Hal I knew nothing and
now am I if a man should speak truly little better than one of
the wicked I must give over this life and I will give it over
Prince Where shall we take a purse tomorrow Jack
me villain and baffle me
labour in his vocation
Enter Poins
Poins Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match O if men
were to be saved by merit what hole in hell were hot enough for
to a true man
Prince Good morrow Ned
Poins Good morrow sweet Hal What says Monsieur Remorse What
says Sir John Sack and Sugar Jack how agrees the devil and thee
about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last for a
Prince Sir John stands to his word the devil shall have his
bargain for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs He will give
the devil his due
early at Gadshill There are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with
rich offerings and traders riding to London with fat purses I
have vizards for you all you have horses for yourselves
you will go I will stuff your purses full of crowns if you will
for going
Poins You will chops
Fal Hal wilt thou make one
Prince Who I rob I a thief Not I by my faith
for ten shillings
Prince I care not
Poins Sir John I prithee leave the Prince and me alone I will
lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go
Fal Well God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears
of profiting that what thou speakest may move and what he hears
prove a false thief for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance Farewell you shall find me in Eastcheap
Exit Falstaff
have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone Falstaff
Bardolph Peto and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have
already waylaid yourself and I will not be there and when they
have the booty if you and I do not rob them cut this head off
from my shoulders
Prince How shall we part with them in setting forth
Poins Why we will set forth before or after them and appoint them
a place of meeting wherein it is at our pleasure to fail and
then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves which they
our habits and by every other appointment to be ourselves
wood our wizards we will change after we leave them and
sirrah I have cases of buckram for the nonce to immask our
noted outward garments
Prince Yea but I doubt they will be too hard for us
this jest will lie the incomprehensible lies that this same fat
rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty at least
he fought with what wards what blows what extremities he
endured and in the reproof of this lies the jest
Poins Farewell my lord                                Exit
Prince I know you all and will awhile uphold
Yet herein will I imitate the sun
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
To smother up his beauty from the world
That when he please again to lie himself
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him
If all the year were playing holidays
To sport would be as tedious as to work
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
So when this loose behaviour I throw off
And pay the debt I never promised
By how much better than my word I am
And like bright metal on a sullen ground
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
Than that which hath no foil to set it off
Redeeming time when men think least I will            Exit
Scene III
London The Palace
Enter the King Northumberland Worcester Hotspur Sir Walter Blunt
with others
King My blood hath been too cold and temperate
Unapt to stir at these indignities
And you have found me for accordingly
You tread upon my patience but be sure
I will from henceforth rather be myself
Which hath been smooth as oil soft as young down
And therefore lost that title of respect
Wor Our house my sovereign liege little deserves
And that same greatness too which our own hands
Have holp to make so portly
King Worcester get thee gone for I do see
Danger and disobedience in thine eye
O sir your presence is too bold and peremptory
And majesty might never yet endure
The moody frontier of a servant brow
Tou have good leave to leave us When we need
Exit Worcester
You were about to speak
North Yea my good lord
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took
Were as he says not with such strength denied
As is delivered to your Majesty
Either envy therefore or misprision
Is guilty of this fault and not my son
Hot My liege I did deny no prisoners
But I remember when the fight was done
When I was dry with rage and extreme toll
Breathless and faint leaning upon my sword
He was perfumed like a milliner
A pouncet box which ever and anon
Who therewith angry when it next came there
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
Betwixt the wind and his nobility
With many holiday and lady terms
He questioned me amongst the rest demanded
I then all smarting with my wounds being cold
Out of my grief and my impatience
He should or he should not for he made me mad
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
Was parmacity for an inward bruise
And that it was great pity so it was
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth
He would himself have been a soldier
This bald unjointed chat of his my lord
I answered indirectly as I said
And I beseech you let not his report
Come current for an accusation
Betwixt my love and your high majesty
Blunt The circumstance considered good my lord
To such a person and in such a place
At such a time with all the rest retold
May reasonably die and never rise
To do him wrong or any way impeach
What then he said so he unsay it now
King Why yet he doth deny his prisoners
But with proviso and exception
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
The lives of those that he did lead to fight
Whose daughter as we hear the Earl of March
Hath lately married Shall our coffers then
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears
When they have lost and forfeited themselves
No on the barren mountains let him starve
For I shall never hold that man my friend
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
To ransom home revolted Mortimer
Hot Revolted Mortimer
He never did fall off my sovereign liege
But by the chance of war To prove that true
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
Those mouthed wounds which valiantly he took
In single opposition hand to hand
He did confound the best part of an hour
In changing hardiment with great Glendower
Who then affrighted with their bloody looks
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank
Bloodstained with these valiant cohabitants
Never did base and rotten policy
Colour her working with such deadly wounds
Nor never could the noble Mortimer
Receive so many and all willingly
Then let not him be slandered with revolt
King Thou dost belie him Percy thou dost belie him
He never did encounter with Glendower
I tell thee
He durst as well have met the devil alone
As Owen Glendower for an enemy
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
As will displease you My Lord Northumberland
Send us your prisoners or you will hear of it
Hot An if the devil come and roar for them
I will not send them I will after straight
And tell him so for I will else my heart
Albeit I make a hazard of my head
North What drunk with choler Stay and pause awhile
Here comes your uncle
Enter Worcester
Hot Speak of Mortimer
Zounds I will speak of him and let my soul
Want mercy if I do not join with him
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust
But I will lift the downtrod Mortimer
As high in the air as this unthankful king
North Brother the King hath made your nephew mad
Wor Who struck this heat up after I was gone
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer
By Richard that dead is the next of blood
North He was I heard the proclamation
And then it was when the unhappy King
Upon his Irish expedition
From whence he intercepted did return
Hot But soft I pray you Did King Richard then
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
Heir to the crown
North He did myself did hear it
Hot Nay then I cannot blame his cousin king
But shall it be that you that set the crown
Upon the head of this forgetful man
And for his sake wear the detested blot
That you a world of curses undergo
Being the agents or base second means
The cords the ladder or the hangman rather
O pardon me that I descend so low
To show the line and the predicament
Wherein you range under this subtile king
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days
Or fill up chronicles in time to come
That men of your nobility and power
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
To put down Richard that sweet lovely rose
And plant this thorn this canker Bolingbroke
And shall it in more shame be further spoken
By him for whom these shames ye underwent
No yet time serves wherein you may redeem
Into the good thoughts of the world again
Of this proud king who studies day and night
To answer all the debt he owes to you
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths
Wor Peace cousin say no more
And now I will unclasp a secret book
As full of peril and adventurous spirit
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear
Hot If he fall in good night or sink or swim
Send danger from the east unto the west
So honour cross it from the north to south
And let them grapple O the blood more stirs
To rouse a lion than to start a hare
North Imagination of some great exploit
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience
Hot By heaven methinks it were an easy leap
Or dive into the bottom of the deep
Where fadom line could never touch the ground
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities
Wor He apprehends a world of figures here
But not the form of what he should attend
Good cousin give me audience for a while
Hot I cry you mercy
Wor Those same noble Scots
By God he shall not have a Scot of them
No if a Scot would save his soul he shall not
Wor You start away
And lend no ear unto my purposes
Those prisoners you shall keep
Hot Nay I will That is flat
He said he would not ransom Mortimer
Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer
But I will find him when he lies asleep
Nay
To keep his anger still in motion
Wor Hear you cousin a word
Hot All studies here I solemnly defy
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke
But that I think his father loves him not
And would be glad he met with some mischance
I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale
Wor Farewell kinsman I will talk to you
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own
Nettled and stung with pismires when I hear
Of this vile politician Bolingbroke
North At Berkeley Castle
Hot You say true
Why what a candy deal of courtesy
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me
Good uncle tell your tale for I have done
Wor Nay if you have not to it again
We will stay your leisure
Wor Then once more to your Scottish prisoners
Deliver them up without their ransom straight
For powers In Scotland which for divers reasons
Shall secretly into the bosom creep
The Archbishop
Hot Of York is it not
Wor True who bears hard
I speak not this in estimation
As what I think might be but what I know
Is ruminated plotted and set down
And only stays but to behold the face
Of that occasion that shall bring it on
Hot I smell it Upon my life it will do well
Hot Why it cannot choose but be a noble plot
And then the power of Scotland and of York
To join with Mortimer ha
Wor And so they shall
To save our heads by raising of a head
For bear ourselves as even as we can
The King will always think him in our debt
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied
Till he hath found a time to pay us home
And see already how he doth begin
To make us strangers to his looks of love
Wor Cousin farewell No further go in this
Than I by letters shall direct your course
When time is ripe which will be suddenly
As I will fashion it shall happily meet
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms
Which now we hold at much uncertainty
North Farewell good brother We shall thrive I trust
Hot Uncle adieu O let the hours be short
Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport    Exeunt

Cham What the commonwealth their boots Will she hold out water
in foul way

I and a true man
Cham Nay rather let me have it as you are a false thief
bring my gelding out of the stable Farewell you muddy knave

Lady O my good lord why are you thus alone
For what offence have I this fortnight been
Thy stomach pleasure and thy golden sleep
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks
And given my treasures and my rights of thee
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed
Of sallies and retires of trenches tent
Of palisadoes frontiers parapets
Of basilisks of cannon culverin
And all the currents of a heady fight
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
Such as we see when men restrain their breath
On some great sudden hest O what portents are these
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand
And I must know it else he loves me not

Directly unto this question that I ask
An if thou wilt not tell my all things true

I will not love myself Do you not love me
Nay tell me if you speak in jest or no

No lady closer for I well believe
Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know
And so far will I trust thee gentle Kate

me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff but a Corinthian a

downstairs his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning I am not yet

in tallow

all cowards Give me a cup of sack rogue Is there no virtue
extant
He drinketh
Prince Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter

Fal And unbound the rest and then come in the other

fifty of them I am a bunch of radish If there were not two or
creature
I am sure I have paid two rogues in buckram suits I tell thee
Thou knowest my old ward Here I lay and thus I bore my point
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me

Prince O monstrous Eleven buckram men grown out of two
Fal But as the devil would have it three misbegotten knaves in
Kendal green came at my back and let drive at me for it was so
dark Hal that thou couldst not see thy hand

Prince Why how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green when
it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand Come tell us your
reason What sayest thou to this
Poins Come your reason Jack your reason
Fal What upon compulsion Zounds an I were at the strappado or

Give you a reason on compulsion If reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries I would give no man a reason upon compulsion I
bowcase you vile standing tuck
Prince Well breathe awhile and then to it again and when thou
hast tired thyself in base comparisons hear me speak but this
Poins Mark Jack
Prince We two saw you four set on four and bound them and were
masters of their wealth Mark now how a plain tale shall put you
you from your prize and have it yea and can show it you here
in the house And Falstaff you carried your guts away as
to hack thy sword as thou hast done and then say it was in
fight What trick what device what starting hole canst thou now
find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame
Fal By the Lord I knew ye as well as he that made ye Why hear
you my masters Was it for me to kill the heir apparent Should
I turn upon the true prince Why thou knowest I am as valiant as
Hercules but beware instinct The lion will not touch the true
prince Instinct is a great matter I was now a coward on
instinct I shall think the better of myself and thee during my
the Lord lads I am glad you have the money Hostess clap to
hearts of gold all the titles of good fellowship come to you
What shall we be merry Shall we have a play extempore
Fal Ah no more of that Hal an thou lovest me
Enter Hostess
Host O Jesu my lord the Prince
Host Marry my lord there is a nobleman of the court at door

Prince Give him as much as will make him a royal man and send him
back again to my mother
Fal What manner of man is he
Host An old man
Fal What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight Shall I give him
his answer
Prince Prithee do Jack
Exit
did you Bardolph You are lions too you ran away upon instinct
Bard Faith I ran when I saw others run
truth out of England but he would make you believe it was done in
fight and persuaded us to do the like
Bard Yea and to tickle our noses with speargrass to make them
bleed and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it
was the blood of true men I did that I did not this seven year
Prince O villain thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago
extempore Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side and yet thou
Bard My lord do you see these meteors Do you behold these
exhalations
Prince I do
Bard What think you they portend
Prince Hot livers and cold purses
Bard Choler my lord if rightly taken
Prince No if rightly taken halter
Enter Falstaff
thine own knee
Fal My own knee When I was about thy years Hal I was not an
Sir John Bracy from your father You must to the court in the
morning That same mad fellow of the North Percy and he of
Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold
and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
Poins O Glendower
Northumberland and that sprightly Scot of Scots Douglas that
Prince He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a
sparrow flying
Fal You have hit it
Prince So did he never the sparrow
Fal Well that rascal hath good metal in him he will not run
Prince Why what a rascal art thou then to praise him so for
running
Prince Yes Jack upon instinct
Fal I grant ye upon instinct Well he is there too and one
Prince Why then it is like if there come a hot June and this
civil buffeting hold we shall buy maidenheads as they buy
hobnails by the hundreds
Fal By the mass lad thou sayest true it is like we shall have
good trading that way But tell me Hal art not thou horrible
afeard Thou being heir apparent could the world pick thee out
three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas that spirit
Percy and that devil Glendower Art thou not horribly afraid
Doth not thy blood thrill at it
thy father If thou love file practise an answer
Prince Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the
particulars of my life
Fal Shall I Content This chair shall be my state this dagger my
sceptre and this cushion my crown
for a leaden dagger and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful
bald crown
Fal Well an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee now shalt
thou be moved Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red
that it may be thought I have wept for I must speak in passion
Prince Well here is my leg
Fal And here is my speech Stand aside nobility
Fal Weep not sweet queen for trickling tears are vain
Host O the Father how he holds his countenance
For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes
Host O Jesu he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as
ever I see
not only marvel where thou spendest thy time but also how thou
art accompanied For though the camomile the more it is trodden
on the faster it grows yet youth the more it is wasted the
word partly my own opinion but chiefly a villanous trick of
thine eye and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip that doth
warrant me If then thou be son to me here lies the point why
being son to me art thou so pointed at Shall the blessed sun of
heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries A question not to be
often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name
of pitch This pitch as ancient writers do report doth defile
so doth the company thou keepest For Harry now I do not speak
to thee in drink but in tears not in pleasure but in passion
not in words only but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous
man whom I have often noted in thy company but I know not  his
name
Prince What manner of man an it like your Majesty
look a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage and as I think
now I remember me his name is Falstaff If that man should be
lewdly given he deceiveth me for Harry I see virtue in his
looks If then the tree may be known by the fruit as the fruit
by the tree then peremptorily I speak it there is virtue in
that Falstaff Him keep with the rest banish And tell me now
thou naughty varlet tell me where hast thou been this month
play my father
Fal Depose me If thou dost it half so gravely so majestically
both in word and matter hang me up by the heels for a
Prince Well here I am set
Fal And here I stand Judge my masters
Prince Now Harry whence come you
Fal My noble lord from Eastcheap
Prince The complaints I hear of thee are grievous
Thou art violently carried away from grace There is a devil
haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man a tun of man is
thy companion Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours
guts that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly
that reverend vice that grey iniquity that father ruffian that
vanity in years Wherein is he good but to taste sack and drink
it wherein neat and cleanly but to carve a capon and eat it
wherein cunning but in craft wherein crafty but in villany
wherein villanous but in all things wherein worthy but in
nothing
Fal I would your Grace would take me with you Whom means your
Grace
Prince That villanous abominable misleader of youth Falstaff
Fal My lord the man I know
Prince I know thou dost
Fal But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say
whoremaster that I utterly deny If sack and sugar be a fault
God help the wicked If to be old and merry be a sin then many
Banish Peto banish Bardolph banish Poins but for sweet Jack
Falstaff kind Jack Falstaff true Jack Falstaff valiant Jack
Falstaff and therefore more valiant being as he is old Jack
Enter Bardolph running
Bard O my lord my lord the sheriff with a most monstrous watch
is at the door
Fal Out ye rogue Play out the play I have much to say in the
behalf of that Falstaff
Enter the Hostess
Host O Jesu my lord my lord
Prince Heigh heigh the devil rides upon a fiddlestick
Host The sheriff and all the watch are at the door They are come
to search the house Shall I let them in
Fal Dost thou hear Hal Never call a true piece of gold a
counterfeit Thou art essentially mad without seeming so
Prince And thou a natural coward without instinct
Fal I deny your major If you will deny the sheriff so if not
let him enter If I become not a cart as well as another man a
plague on my bringing up I hope I shall as soon be strangled
with a halter as another
Prince Go hide thee behind the arras The rest walk up above
Now my masters for a true face and good conscience
Fal Both which I have had but their date is out and therefore
Prince Call in the sheriff
Enter Sheriff and the Carrier
Now Master Sheriff what is your will with me
Sher First pardon me my lord A hue and cry
Hath followed certain men unto this house
Prince What men
A gross fat man
Carrier As fat as butter
Prince The man I do assure you is not here
And sheriff I will engage my word to thee
Send him to answer thee or any man
And so let me entreat you leave the house
Sher I will my lord There are two gentlemen
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks
He shall be answerable and so farewell
Sher Good night my noble lord
Prince I think it is good morrow is it not
forth
Peto Falstaff Fast asleep behind the arras and snorting like a
horse
Prince Hark how hard he fetches breath Search his pockets
He searcheth his pockets and findeth certain papers
What hast thou found
Peto Nothing but papers my lord
Item Sauce                   iiii d
Item Sack two gallons         v s viii d
Item Anchovies and sack after supper  ii s vi d
Prince O monstrous but one halfpennyworth of bread to this
the court in the morning  We must all to the wars and thy place
foot and I know his death will be a march of twelve score The
money shall be paid back again with advantage Be with me betimes
in the morning and so good morrow Peto
Peto Good morrow good my lord
Exeunt

Mort These promises are fair the parties sure
And our induction full of prosperous hope
Hot Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower
Will you sit down
And uncle Worcester A plague upon it
I have forgot the map
Glend No here it is
Sit cousin Percy sit good cousin Hotspur
For by that name as oft as Lancaster
Doth speak of you his cheek looks pale and with
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven
Hot And you in hell as oft as he hears
Owen Glendower spoke of
Glend I cannot blame him At my nativity
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
Of burning cressets and at my birth
The frame and huge foundation of the earth
Hot Why so it would have done at the same season if your
born
Glend I say the earth did shake when I was born
Hot And I say the earth was not of my mind
If you suppose as fearing you it shook
Glend The heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble
Hot O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire
And not in fear of your nativity
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
In strange eruptions oft the teeming earth
By the imprisoning of unruly wind
Within her womb which for enlargement striving
Shakes the old beldame earth and topples down
Steeples and mossgrown towers At your birth
In passion shook
Glend Cousin of many men
I do not bear these crossings Give me leave
To tell you once again that at my birth
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
The goats ran from the mountains and the herds
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields
And all the courses of my life do show
I am not in the roll of common men
That chides the banks of England Scotland Wales
Which calls me pupil or hath read to me
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
And hold me pace in deep experiments
Mort Peace cousin Percy you will make him mad
Glend I can call spirits from the vasty deep
Hot Why so can I or so can any man
But will they come when you do call for them
Glend Why I can teach you cousin to command the devil
By telling truth Tell truth and shame the devil
If thou have power to raise him bring him hither
O while you live tell truth and shame the devil
Mort Come come no more of this unprofitable chat
Glend Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
Against my power thrice from the banks of Wye
Hot Home without boots and in foul weather too
Mort The Archdeacon hath divided it
Into three limits very equally
England from Trent and Severn hitherto
All westward Wales beyond the Severn shore
And all the fertile land within that bound
To Owen Glendower and dear coz to you
The remnant northward lying off from Trent
And our indentures tripartite are drawn
Which being sealed interchangeably
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
To meet your father and the Scottish bower
As is appointed us at Shrewsbury
My father Glendower is not ready yet
Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days
Your tenants friends and neighbouring gentlemen
Glend A shorter time shall send me to you lords
And in my conduct shall your ladies come
From whom you now must steal and take no leave
For there will be a world of water shed
Upon the parting of your wives and you
Hot Methinks my moiety north from Burton here
In quantity equals not one of yours
See how this river comes me cranking in
And cuts me from the best of all my land
And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run
In a new channel fair and evenly
It shall not wind with such a deep indent
To rob me of so rich a bottom here
Glend Not wind It shall it must You see it doth
Mort Yea but
Mark how he bears his course and runs me up
With like advantage on the other side
Gelding the opposed continent as much
As on the other side it takes from you
Wor Yea but a little charge will trench him here
And on this north side win this cape of land
And then he runs straight and even
Hot Will not you
Glend No nor you shall not
Hot Who shall say me nay
Glend No that will I
Hot Let me not understand you then speak it in Welsh
Glend I can speak English lord as well as you
Where being but young I framed to the harp
Many an English ditty lovely well
A virtue that was never seen in you
Hot Marry
And I am glad of it with all my heart
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge
Nothing so much as mincing poetry
But in the way of bargain mark ye me
Are the indentures drawn Shall we be gone
Glend The moon shines fair you may away by night
Break with your wives of your departure hence
I am afraid my daughter will run mad
So much she doteth on her Mortimer                    Exit
Mort Fie cousin Percy how you cross my father
Hot I cannot choose Sometimes he angers me
With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies
And of a dragon and a finless fish
A couching lion and a ramping cat
He held me last night at least nine hours
As a tired horse a railing wife
Worse than a smoky house I had rather live
With cheese and garlic in a windmill far
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
Mort In faith he is a worthy gentleman
Exceedingly well read and profited
In strange concealments valiant as a lion
And wondrous affable and as bountiful
As mines of India Shall I tell you cousin
He holds your temper in a high respect
And curbs himself even of his natural scope
I warrant you that man is not alive
Might so have tempted him as you have done
Without the taste of danger and reproof
But do not use it oft let me entreat you
And since your coming hither have done enough
To put him quite besides his patience
You must needs learn lord to amend this fault
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
Defect of manners want of government
Pride haughtiness opinion and disdain
The least of which haunting a nobleman
Upon the beauty of all parts besides
Beguiling them of commendation
Here come our wives and let us take our leave
Enter Glendower with the Ladies
My wife can speak no English I no Welsh
Glend My daughter weeps she will not part with you
Mort Good father tell her that she and my aunt Percy
Shall follow in your conduct speedily
Glendower speaks to her in Welsh and she answers
him in the same
One that no persuasion can do good upon
The Lady speaks in Welsh
Mort I understand thy looks That pretty Welsh
Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
I am too perfect in and but for shame
In such a Barley should I answer thee
The Lady again in Welsh
I understand thy kisses and thou mine
But I will never be a truant love
Till I have learnt thy language for thy tongue
With ravishing division to her lute
Glend Nay if you melt then will she run mad
The Lady speaks again in Welsh
Mort O I am ignorance itself in this
Glend She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
And rest your gentle head upon her lap
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness
As is the difference betwixt day and night
Begins his golden progress in the East
By that time will our book I think be drawn
Glend Do so
And those musicians that shall play to you
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence
And straight they shall be here Sit and attend
Hot Come Kate thou art perfect in lying down Come quick
quick that I may lay my head in thy lap
Lady P Go ye giddy goose
The music plays
Hot Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh
Lady P Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
lady sing in Welsh
Hot I had rather hear Lady my brach howl in Irish
Lady P Wouldst thou have thy head broken
Hot No
Lady P Then be still
Lady P Now God help thee
Hot Peace she sings
Here the Lady sings a Welsh song
Lady P Not mine in good sooth
Hot Not yours in good sooth Heart you swear like a
And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
Swear me Kate like a lady as thou art
And such protest of pepper gingerbread
To velvet guards and Sunday citizens Come sing
Lady P I will not sing
come in when ye will                                  Exit
Glend Come come Lord Mortimer You are as slow
As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go
And then to horse immediately
Mort With all my heart
Exeunt
Scene II
London The Palace
Enter the King Prince of Wales and others
King Lords give us leave The Prince of Wales and I
Must have some private conference but be near at hand
For we shall presently have need of you
Exeunt Lords
I know not whether God will have it so
For some displeasing service I have done
That in his secret doom out of my blood
But thou dost in thy passages of life
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
To punish my mistreadings Tell me else
Could such inordinate and low desires
Such poor such bare such lewd such mean attempts
Such barren pleasures rude society
Accompany the greatness of thy blood
And hold their level with thy princely heart
Prince So please your Majesty I would I could
Quit all offences with as clear excuse
As well as I am doubtless I can purge
Myself of many I am charged withal
Yet such extenuation let me beg
Which oft the ear of greatness needs must bear
By smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers
I may for some things true wherein my youth
And pardon on lily true submission
King God pardon thee Yet let me wonder Harry
At thy affections which do hold a wing
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost
Which by thy younger brother is supplied
And art almost an alien to the hearts
Of all the court and princes of my blood
The hope and expectation of thy time
Prophetically do forethink thy fall
Had I so lavish of my presence been
So stale and cheap to vulgar company
Opinion that did help me to the crown
Had still kept loyal to possession
And left me in reputeless banishment
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood
By being seldom seen I could not stir
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
Even in the presence of the crowned King
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new
My presence like a robe pontifical
And won by rareness such solemnity
The skipping King he ambled up and down
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
Soon kindled and soon burnt carded his state
Had his great name profaned with their scorns
And gave his countenance against his name
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
Of every beardless vain comparative
Grew a companion to the common streets
They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little
More than a little is by much too much
So when he had occasion to be seen
He was but as the cuckoo is in June
As sick and blunted with community
Afford no extraordinary gaze
Such as is bent on unlike majesty
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes
As cloudy men use to their adversaries
And in that very line Harry standest thou
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
With vile participation Not an eye
But is aweary of thy common sight
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness
Be more myself
King For all the world
As thou art to this hour was Richard then
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh
And even as I was then is Percy now
Now by my sceptre and my soul to boot
He hath more worthy interest to the state
Than thou the shadow of succession
For of no right nor colour like to right
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm
And Being no more in debt to years than thou
Leads ancient lords and reverend Bishops on
To bloody battles and to bruising arms
Against renowmed Douglas whose high deeds
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
Holds from all soldiers chief majority
And military title capital
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ
Thrice hath this Hotspur Mars in swathling clothes
This infant warrior in his enterprises
Enlarged him and made a friend of him
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
And shake the peace and safety of our throne
And what say you to this Percy Northumberland
Capitulate against us and are up
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee
Why Harry do I tell thee of my foes
Thou that art like enough through vassal fear
Base inclination and the start of spleen
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns
To show how much thou art degenerate
Prince Do not think so You shall not find it so
And in the closing of some glorious day
Be bold to tell you that I am your son
When I will wear a garment all of blood
And stain my favours in a bloody mask
That this same child of honour and renown
And your unthought of Harry chance to meet
For every honour sitting on his helm
Would they were multitudes and on my head
My shames redoubled For the time will come
That I shall make this Northern youth exchange
His glorious deeds for my indignities
Percy is but my factor good my lord
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
And I will call hall to so strict account
That he shall render every glory up
Yea even the slightest worship of his time
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart
This in the name of God I promise here
I do beseech your Majesty may salve
If not the end of life cancels all bands
And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow
King A hundred thousand rebels die in this
Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein
Enter Blunt
How now good Blunt Thy looks are full of speed
Blunt So hath the business that I come to speak of
Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
That Douglas and the English rebels met
The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
A mighty and a fearful head they are
If promises be kept oil every hand
With him my son Lord John of Lancaster
For this advertisement is five days old
On Wednesday next Harry you shall set forward
On Thursday we ourselves will march Our meeting
Is Bridgenorth and Harry you shall march
Through Gloucestershire by which account
Our business valued some twelve days hence
Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet
Advantage feeds him fat while men delay            Exeunt

ACT IV Scene I
The rebel camp near Shrewsbury
Enter Harry Hotspur Worcester and Douglas
Hot Well said my noble Scot If speaking truth
In this fine age were not thought flattery
Such attribution should the Douglas have
Should go so general current through the world
By God I cannot flatter I defy
The tongues of soothers but a braver place
Nay task me to my word approve me lord
Doug Thou art the king of honour
No man so potent breathes upon the ground
But I will beard him
Enter one with letters
Messenger These letters come from your father
Hot Letters from him Why comes he not himself
Mess He cannot come my lord he is grievous sick
Hot Zounds how has he the leisure to be sick
In such a justling time Who leads his power
Under whose government come they along
Mess His letters bears his mind not I my lord
Wor I prithee tell me doth he keep his bed
Mess He did my lord four days ere I set forth
And at the time of my departure thence
Wor I would the state of time had first been whole
Ere he by sickness had been visited
His health was never better worth than now
Hot Sick now droop now This sickness doth infect
The very lifeblood of our enterprise
And that his friends by deputation could not
So soon be drawn no did he think it meet
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
That with our small conjunction we should on
For as he writes there is no quailing now
Of all our purposes What say you to it
And yet in faith it is not His present want
Seems more than we shall find it Were it good
To set the exact wealth of all our states
All at one cast to set so rich a man
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
It were not good for therein should we read
The very bottom and the soul of hope
The very list the very utmost bound
Of all our fortunes
Doug Faith and so we should
Where now remains a sweet reversion
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
Is to come in
A comfort of retirement lives in this
Hot A rendezvous a home to fly unto
If that the devil and mischance look big
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs
Wor But yet I would your father had been here
The quality and hair of our attempt
Brooks no division It will be thought
By some that know not why he is away
That wisdom loyalty and mere dislike
Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence
And think how such an apprehension
May turn the tide of fearful faction
And breed a kind of question in our cause
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
The eye of reason may pry in upon us
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
Before not dreamt of
Hot You strain too far
I rather of his absence make this use
It lends a lustre and more great opinion
A larger dare to our great enterprise
Than if the Earl were here for men must think
If we without his help can make a head
To push against a kingdom with his help
Yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole
Doug As heart can think There is not such a word
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear
Enter Sir Richard Vernon
Hot My cousin Vernon welcome by my soul
Ver Pray God my news be worth a welcome lord
The Earl of Westmoreland seven thousand strong
Is marching hitherwards with him Prince John
Hot No harm What more
The King himself in person is set forth
Or hitherwards intended speedily
With strong and mighty preparation
Hot He shall be welcome too Where is his son
And bid it pass
Glittering in golden coats like images
As full of spirit as the month of May
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer
Wanton as youthful goats wild as young bulls
I saw young Harry with his beaver on
Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury
And vaulted with such ease into his seat
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
And witch the world with noble horsemanship
Hot No more no more Worse than the sun in March
This praise doth nourish agues Let them come
They come like sacrifices in their trim
All hot and bleeding Will we offer them
The mailed Mars Shall on his altar sit
Up to the ears in blood I am on fire
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
And yet not ours Come let me taste my horse
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales
Harry to Harry shall hot horse to horse
that Glendower were come
Ver There is more news
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days
Wor Ay by my faith that bears a frosty sound
Ver To thirty thousand
Hot Forty let it be
My father and Glendower being both away
The powers of us may serve so great a day
Come let us take a muster speedily
Doomsday is near Die all die merrily
Doug Talk not of dying I am out of fear

Enter the Prince and the Lord of Westmoreland
Prince How now blown Jack How now quilt
Fal What Hal How now mad wag What a devil dost thou in
Warwickshire My good Lord of Westmoreland I cry you mercy I
thought your honour had already been at Shrewsbury
you too but my powers are there already The King I can tell
Fal Tut never fear me I am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream
Prince I think to steal cream indeed for thy theft hath already
made thee butter But tell me Jack whose fellows are these that
come after

The rebel camp near Shrewsbury
Enter Hotspur Worcester Douglas Vernon
Wor It may not be
Doug You give him then advantage
Ver Not a whit
Hot Why say you so Looks he no for supply
Ver So do we
Ver Do not my lord
Doug You do not counsel well
You speak it out of fear and cold heart
I hold as little counsel with weak fear
As you my lord or any Scot that this day lives
Which of us fears
Ver Content
Come come it may not be I wonder much
Being men of such great leading as you are
That you foresee not what impediments
Drag back our expedition Certain horse
And now their pride and mettle is asleep
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull
That not a horse is half the half of himself
Hot So are the horses of the enemy
The better part of ours are full of rest
Wor The number of the King exceedeth ours
The trumpet sounds a parley
Enter Sir Walter Blunt
Blunt I come with gracious offers from the King
If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
Hot Welcome Sir Walter Blunt and would to God
You were of our determination
Some of us love you well and even those some
Envy your great deservings and good name
Because you are not of our quality
But stand against us like an enemy
Blunt And God defend but still I should stand so
So long as out of limit and true rule
You stand against anointed majesty
But to my charge The King hath sent to know
The nature of your griefs and whereupon
You conjure from the breast of civil peace
Such bold hostility teaching his duteous land
Audacious cruelty If that the King
Have any way your good deserts forgot
Which he confesseth to be manifold
He bids you name your griefs and with all speed
You shall have your desires with interest
And pardon absolute for yourself and these
Herein misled by your suggestion
Hot The King is kind and well we know the King
Knows at what time to promise when to pay
My father and my uncle and myself
Did give him that same royalty he wears
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home
My father gave him welcome to the shore
And when he heard him swear and vow to God
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster
To sue his livery and beg his peace
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal
Swore him assistance and performed it too
Now when the lords and barons of the realm
The more and less came in with cap and knee
Met him on boroughs cities villages
Attended him on bridges stood in lanes
Give him their heirs as pages followed him
Even at the heels in golden multitudes
He presently as greatness knows itself
Steps me a little higher than his vow
Made to my father while his blood was poor
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh
And now forsooth takes on him to reform
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth
Cries out upon abuses seems to weep
This seeming brow of justice did he win
The hearts of all that he did angle for
Of all the favourites that the absent King
In deputation left behind him here
When he was personal in the Irish war
But Tut I came not to hear this
Hot Then to the point
There without ransom to lie forfeited
Sought to entrap me by intelligence
Rated mine uncle from the Council board
Broke an oath on oath committed wrong on wrong
And in conclusion drove us to seek out
This head of safety and withal to pry
Into his title the which we find
Too indirect for long continuance
Blunt Shall I return this answer to the King
Some surety for a safe return again
And In the morning early shall mine uncle
Bring him our purposes and so farewell
Blunt I would you would accept of grace and love
Hot And may be so we shall
Blunt Pray God you do
Exeunt
Scene IV
Enter the Archbishop of York and Sir Michael
Arch Hie good Sir Michael bear this sealed brief
With winged haste to the Lord Marshal
This to my cousin Scroop and all the rest
To whom they are directed If you knew
How much they do import you would make haste
Sir M My good lord
I guess their tenour
Arch Like enough you do
Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
Must bide the touch for sir at Shrewsbury
As I am truly given to understand
Meets with Lord Harry and I fear Sir Michael
What with the sickness of Northumberland
Whose power was in the first proportion
Who with them was a rated sinew too
I fear the power of Percy is too weak
To wage an instant trial with the King
Sir M Why my good lord you need not fear
There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer
Arch No Mortimer is not there
Sir M But there is Mordake Vernon Lord Harry Percy
And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
Of gallant warriors noble gentlemen
Arch And so there is but yet the King hath drawn
The Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster
The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt
And many moe corrivals and dear men
Of estimation and command in arms
And to prevent the worst Sir Michael speed
For if Lord Percy thrive not ere the King
Dismiss his power he means to visit us
For he hath heard of our confederacy
Therefore make haste I must go write again
To other friends and so farewell Sir Michael
Exeunt

ACT V Scene I
Enter the King Prince of Wales Lord John of Lancaster Sir Walter Blunt
Falstaff
King How bloodily the sun begins to peer
Above yon busky hill The day looks pale
Prince The southern wind
Doth play the trumpet to his purposes
And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
King Theft with the losers let it sympathize
For nothing can seem foul to those that win
That you and I should meet upon such terms
And made us doff our easy robes of peace
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
This is not well my lord this is not well
What say you to it Will you again unknit
And move in that obedient orb again
Where you did give a fair and natural light
A prodigy of fear and a portent
Of broached mischief to the unborn times
Wor Hear me my liege
For mine own part I could be well content
With quiet hours for I do protest
I have not sought the day of this dislike
King You have not sought it How comes it then
Fal Rebellion lay in his way and he found it
Prince Peace chewet peace
Of favour from myself and all our house
And yet I must remember you my lord
We were the first and dearest of your friends
For you my staff of office did I break
To meet you on the way and kiss your hand
When yet you were in place and in account
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I
It was myself my brother and his son
That brought you home and boldly did outdare
The dangers of the time You swore to us
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster
The seat of Gaunt dukedom of Lancaster
To this we swore our aid But in short space
What with our help what with the absent King
What with the injuries of a wanton time
The seeming sufferances that you had borne
And the contrarious winds that held the King
So long in his unlucky Irish wars
And from this swarm of fair advantages
To gripe the general sway into your hand
Forgot your oath to us at Doncaster
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
That even our love thirst not come near your sight
For fear of swallowing but with nimble wing
Out of your sight and raise this present head
Whereby we stand opposed by such means
By unkind usage dangerous countenance
And violation of all faith and troth
Sworn to tis in your younger enterprise
King These things indeed you have articulate
To face the garment of rebellion
With some fine colour that may please the eye
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
Of hurlyburly innovation
And never yet did insurrection want
Such water colours to impaint his cause
Nor moody beggars starving for a time
Prince In both our armies there is many a soul
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter
If once they join in trial Tell your nephew
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
In praise of Henry Percy By my hopes
This present enterprise set off his head
I do not think a braver gentleman
More daring or more bold is now alive
To grace this latter age with noble deeds
For my part I may speak it to my shame
I have a truant been to chivalry
And so I hear he doth account me too
I am content that he shall take the odds
Of his great name and estimation
And will to save the blood on either side
Try fortune with him in a single fight
King And Prince of Wales so dare we venture thee
Albeit considerations infinite
Do make against it No good Worcester no
We love our people well even those we love
And will they take the offer of our grace
Both he and they and you yea every man
So tell your cousin and bring me word
What he will do But if he will not yield
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
And they shall do their office So be gone
We will not now be troubled with reply
We offer fair take it advisedly
Prince It will not be accepted on my life
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
Are confident against the world in arms
King Hence therefore every leader to his charge
For on their answer will we set on them
And God befriend us as our cause is just
Exeunt Manent Prince Falstaff
Fal Hal if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me so
Prince Nothing but a Colossus can do thee that friendship
Say thy prayers and farewell
Prince Why thou owest God a death
Exit
What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me Well
me off when I come on How then Can honor set to a leg No Or
an arm No Or take away the grief of a wound No Honour hath no
skill in surgery then No What is honour A word What is that
word honour Air A trim reckoning Who hath it He that died a
insensible then Yea to the dead But will it not live with the
Exit
Scene II
The rebel camp
Enter Worcester and Sir Richard Vernon
Wor O no my nephew must not know Sir Richard
The liberal and kind offer of the King
Wor Then are we all undone
It is not possible it cannot be
The King should keep his word in loving us
He will suspect us still and find a time
To punish this offence in other faults
Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes
For treason is but trusted like the fox
Will have a wild trick of his ancestors
Look how we can or sad or merrily
Interpretation will misquote our looks
And we shall feed like oxen at a stall
It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood
All his offences live upon my head
And his corruption being taken from us
We as the spring of all shall pay for all
Therefore good cousin let not Harry know
In any case the offer of the King
Here comes your cousin
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland
Uncle what news
Wor The King will bid you battle presently
Doug Defy him by the Lord Of Westmoreland
Hot Lord Douglas go you and tell him so
Doug Marry and shall and very willingly
Exit
Wor There is no seeming mercy in the King
Hot Did you beg any God forbid
Wor I told him gently of our grievances
By now forswearing that he is forsworn
He calls us rebels traitors aid will scourge
With haughty arms this hateful name in us
Enter Douglas
Doug Arm gentlemen to arms for I have thrown
Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on
Hot O would the quarrel lay upon our heads
But I and Harry Monmouth Tell me tell me
No by my soul I never in my life
Unless a brother should a brother dare
To gentle exercise and proof of arms
He gave you all the duties of a man
Spoke your deservings like a chronicle
Making you ever better than his praise
By still dispraising praise valued with you
And which became him like a prince indeed
He made a blushing cital of himself
And chid his truant youth with such a grace
Of teaching and of learning instantly
There did he pause but let me tell the world
If he outlive the envy of this day
England did never owe so sweet a hope
So much misconstrued in his wantonness
Hot Cousin I think thou art enamoured
Upon his follies Never did I hear
Of any prince so wild a libertine
But be he as he will yet once ere night
That he shall shrink under my courtesy
Arm arm with speed and fellows soldiers friends
Better consider what you have to do
Than I that have not well the gift of tongue
Can lift your blood up with persuasion
Enter a Messenger
Mess My lord here are letters for you
O gentlemen the time of life is short
To spend that shortness basely were too long
Still ending at the arrival of an hour
An if we live we live to tread on kings
If die brave death when princes die with us
Now for our consciences the arms are fair
When the intent of bearing them is just
Enter another Messenger
Mess My lord prepare The King comes on apace
Hot I thank him that he cuts me from my tale
Let each man do his best and here draw I
A sword whose temper I intend to stain
With the best blood that I can meet withal
In the adventure of this perilous day
Now Esperance Percy and set on
Sound all the lofty instruments of war
And by that music let us all embrace
For heaven to earth some of us never shall
A second time do such a courtesy
Here they embrace The trumpets sound
Scene III
Plain between the camps
The King enters with his Power  Alarum to the battle  Then enter Douglas
and Sir Walter Blunt
Blunt What is thy name that in the battle thus
Thou crossest me What honour dost thou seek
Upon my head
Doug Know then my name is Douglas
And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
Because some tell me that thou art a king
Blunt They tell thee true
Thy likeness for instead of thee King Harry
This sword hath ended him So shall it thee
Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner
Blunt I was not born a yielder thou proud Scot
And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
They fight Douglas kills Blunt Then enter Hotspur
Hot O Douglas hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus
Hot Where
Doug Here
Hot This Douglas No I know this face full well
A gallant knight he was his name was Blunt
Doug A fool go with thy soul whither it goes
A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear
Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king
Hot The King hath many marching in his coats
Doug Now by my sword I will kill all his coats
Until I meet the King
Hot Up and away
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day
Exeunt
Alarum Enter Falstaff solus
as hot as molten lead and as heavy too God keep lead out of me
I need no more weight than mine own bowels I have led my
beg during life But who comes here
Enter the Prince
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies
Rend me thy sword
Fal O Hal I prithee give me leave to breathe awhile Turk Gregory
never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day I have paid
Percy I have made him sure
Prince He is indeed and living to kill thee
I prithee lend me thy sword
sword but take my pistol if thou wilt
Prince Give it me What is it in the case
The Prince draws it out and finds it to he a bottle of sack
What is it a time to jest and dally now
He throws the bottle at him Exit
way so if he do not if I come in his willingly let him make a
carbonado of me I like not such grinning honour as Sir Walter
hath Give me life which if I can save so if not honour comes
Scene IV
Another part of the field
Alarum Excursions Enter the King the Prince Lord John of Lancaster
Earl of Westmoreland
King I prithee
Harry withdraw thyself thou bleedest too much
Lord John of Lancaster go you unto him
John Not I my lord unless I did bleed too
Prince I do beseech your Majesty make up
Lest Your retirement do amaze your friends
King I will do so
My Lord of Westmoreland lead him to his tent
Prince Lead me my lord I do not need your help
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
The Prince of Wales from such a field as this
John We breathe too long Come cousin Westmoreland
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit
But now I do respect thee as my soul
King I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
With lustier maintenance than I did look for
Of such an ungrown warrior
Prince O this boy
Lends mettle to us all                                Exit
Enter Douglas
I am the Douglas fatal to all those
That wear those colours on them What art thou
King The King himself who Douglas grieves at heart
So many of his shadows thou hast met
And not the very King I have two boys
Seek Percy and thyself about the field
I will assay thee So defend thyself
Doug I fear thou art another counterfeit
And yet in faith thou bearest thee like a king
And thus I win thee
They fight The King being in danger enter Prince of Wales
Prince Hold up thy head vile Scot or thou art like
Never to hold it up again The spirits
Of valiant Shirley Stafford Blunt are in my arms
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee
Who never promiseth but he means to pay
They fight Douglas flieth
Cheerly my lord How fares your Grace
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succour sent
King Stay and breathe awhile
In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me
Prince O God they did me too much injury
If it were so I might have let alone
The insulting hand of Douglas over you
Which would have been as speedy in your end
As all the poisonous potions in the world
Exit
Enter Hotspur
Hot If I mistake not thou art Harry Monmouth
Hot My name is Harry Percy
Prince Why then I see
A very valiant rebel of the name
I am the Prince of Wales and think not Percy
To share with me in glory any more
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere
Nor can one England brook a double reign
Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales
Hot Nor shall it Harry for the hour is come
To end the one of us and would to God
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine
And all the budding honours on thy crest
Hot I can no longer brook thy vanities
They fight
Enter Falstaff
here I can tell you
Enter Douglas He fighteth with Falstaff who falls down as if
I better brook the loss of brittle life
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me
They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh
And time that takes survey of all the world
Must have a stop O I could prophesy
But that the earthy and cold hand of death
Lies on my tongue No Percy thou art dust
Prince For worms brave Percy Fare thee well great heart
When that this body did contain a spirit
A kingdom for it was too small a bound
But now two paces of the vilest earth
Is room enough This earth that bears thee dead
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman
If thou wert sensible of courtesy
I should not make so dear a show of zeal
But let my favours hide thy mangled face
For doing these fair rites of tenderness
Adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave
He spieth Falstaff on the ground
What old acquaintance Could not all this flesh
Keep in a little life Poor Jack farewell
O I should have a heavy miss of thee
If I were much in love with vanity
Though many dearer in this bloody fray
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie                 Exit
Falstaff riseth up
counterfeit or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot
too Counterfeit I lie I am no counterfeit To die is to be a
counterfeit for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not
the life of a man but to counterfeit dying when a man thereby
liveth is to be no counterfeit but the true and perfect image
of life indeed The better part of valour is discretion in the
which better part I have saved my life Zounds I am afraid of
this gunpowder Percy though he be dead How if he should
counterfeit too and rise By my faith I am afraid he would
Nothing confutes me but eyes and nobody sees me Therefore
along with me
Lancaster
Thy maiden sword
John But soft whom have we here
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead
Prince I did I saw him dead
Breathless and bleeding on the ground Art thou alive
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight
I prithee speak We will not trust our eyes
will do me any honour so if not let him kill the next Percy
himself I look to be either earl or duke I can assure you
Fal Didst thou Lord Lord how this world is given to lying I
grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he but we
rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury
upon my death I gave him this wound in the thigh If the man
were alive and would deny it zounds I would make him eat a
piece of my sword
John This is the strangest tale that ever I beard
Prince This is the strangest fellow brother John
Come bring your luggage nobly on your back
For my part if a lie may do thee grace
A retreat is sounded
The trumpet sounds retreat the day is ours
To see what friends are living who are dead
and leave sack and live cleanly as a nobleman should do
Scene V
Another part of the field
Earl of Westmoreland with Worcester and Vernon prisoners
King Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke
Pardon and terms of love to all of you
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary
A noble earl and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence
And I embrace this fortune patiently
Since not to be avoided it fails on me
King Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too
Other offenders we will pause upon
How goes the field
Prince The noble Scot Lord Douglas when he saw
The Noble Percy slain and all his men
Upon the foot of fear fled with the rest
That the pursuers took him At my tent
The Douglas is and I beseech Your Grace
I may dispose of him
King With all my heart
Prince Then brother John of Lancaster to you
This honourable bounty shall belong
Go to the Douglas and deliver him
Up to his pleasure ransomless and free
His valour shown upon our crests today
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries
John I thank your Grace for this high courtesy
Which I shall give away immediately
King Then this remains that we divide our power
You son John and my cousin Westmoreland
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop
Who as we hear are busily in arms
Myself and you son Harry will towards Wales
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March
Rebellion in this laud shall lose his sway
Meeting the check of such another day
And since this business so fair is done
Let us not leave till all our own be won
Exeunt

Enter RUMOUR painted full of tongues
RUMOUR Open your ears for which of you will stop
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks
I from the orient to the drooping west
The acts commenced on this ball of earth
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride
The which in every language I pronounce
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports
I speak of peace while covert emnity
Under the smile of safety wounds the world
And who but Rumour who but only I
Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war
And no such matter Rumour is a pipe
Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures
And of so easy and so plain a stop
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads
Can play upon it But what need I thus
Among my household Why is Rumour here
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
To speak so true at first My office is
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
And not a man of them brings other news
They bring smooth comforts false worse than true wrongs

ACT I SCENE I
Enter LORD BARDOLPH
LORD BARDOLPH Who keeps the gate here ho
The PORTER opens the gate
Where is the Earl
PORTER What shall I say you are
LORD BARDOLPH Tell thou the Earl
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here
Please it your honour knock but at the gate
And he himself will answer
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
LORD BARDOLPH Here comes the Earl                Exit PORTER
NORTHUMBERLAND What news Lord Bardolph Every minute now
Should be the father of some stratagem
The times are wild contention like a horse
Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose
And bears down all before him
LORD BARDOLPH Noble Earl
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury
NORTHUMBERLAND Good an God will
LORD BARDOLPH As good as heart can wish
The King is almost wounded to the death
And in the fortune of my lord your son
Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field
Is prisoner to your son O such a day
So fought so followed and so fairly won
Came not till now to dignify the times
Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury
LORD BARDOLPH I spake with one my lord that came from thence
A gentleman well bred and of good name
Enter TRAVERS
NORTHUMBERLAND Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent
On Tuesday last to listen after news
More than he haply may retail from me
NORTHUMBERLAND Now Travers what good tidings comes with you
A gentleman almost forspent with speed
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury
He told me that rebellion had bad luck
With that he gave his able horse the head
And bending forward struck his armed heels
Against the panting sides of his poor jade
Staying no longer question
NORTHUMBERLAND Ha Again
Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion
Had met ill luck
If my young lord your son have not the day
Upon mine honour for a silken point
NORTHUMBERLAND Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
Give then such instances of loss
The horse he rode on and upon my life
Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news
Enter Morton
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury
MORTON I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
To fright our party
NORTHUMBERLAND How doth my son and brother
Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand
Even such a man so faint so spiritless
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds
But in the end to stop my ear indeed
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise
MORTON Douglas is living and your brother yet
NORTHUMBERLAND Why he is dead
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath
He that but fears the thing he would not know
Tell thou an earl his divination lies
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong
MORTON You are too great to be by me gainsaid
Your spirit is too true your fears too certain
I see a strange confession in thine eye
To speak a truth If he be slain say so
The tongue offends not that reports his death
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead
Not he which says the dead is not alive
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
Hath but a losing office and his tongue
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell
LORD BARDOLPH I cannot think my lord your son is dead
MORTON I am sorry I should force you to believe
That which I would to God I had not seen
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state
To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down
From whence with life he never more sprung up
Being bruited once took fire and heat away
For from his metal was his party steeled
Which once in him abated an the rest
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety
Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester
Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all
Is that the King hath won and hath sent out
A speedy power to encounter you my lord
Under the conduct of young Lancaster
And Westmoreland This is the news at full
NORTHUMBERLAND For this I shall have time enough to mourn
In poison there is physic and these news
Having been well that would have made me sick
Being sick have in some measure made me well
Like strengthless hinges buckle under life
Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire
Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
Now bind my brows with iron and approach
And let this world no longer be a stage
Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set
On bloody courses the rude scene may end
And darkness be the burier of the dead
LORD BARDOLPH This strained passion doth you wrong my lord
MORTON Sweet Earl divorce not wisdom from your honour
The lives of all your loving complices
To stormy passion must perforce decay
That in the dole of blows your son might drop
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
Though strongly apprehended could restrain
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
More than that being which was like to be
LORD BARDOLPH We all that are engaged to this loss
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
Come we will put forth body and goods
I hear for certain and dare speak the truth
The gentle Archbishop of York is up
Who with a double surety binds his followers
My lord your son had only but the corpse
But shadows and the shows of men to fight
The action of their bodies from their souls
As men drink potions that their weapons only
As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop
Turns insurrection to religion
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke
And more and less do flock to follow him
NORTHUMBERLAND I knew of this before but to speak truth
Go in with me and counsel every man
The aptest way for safety and revenge
Never so few and never yet more need                Exeunt
SCENE II
London A street
Enter SIR JOHN FALSTAFF with his PAGE bearing his sword and buckler
FALSTAFF Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water
PAGE He said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but
for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he
knew for
FALSTAFF Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The brain of
that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on
me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in
other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath
my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I
have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be
an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor
silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your
chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the
palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he
out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton about
the satin for my short cloak and my slops
PAGE He said sir you should procure him better assurance than
Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not the
security
bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The
bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with
had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop
yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security
Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of
abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and
yet cannot he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him
Smithfield An I could get me but a wife in the stews I were
Enter the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE and SERVANT
PAGE Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the
Prince for striking him about Bardolph
FALSTAFF Wait close I will not see him
SERVANT He my lord but he hath since done good service at
Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to the
Lord John of Lancaster
CHIEF JUSTICE What to York Call him back again
SERVANT Sir John Falstaff
FALSTAFF Boy tell him I am deaf
PAGE You must speak louder my master is deaf
CHIEF JUSTICE I am sure he is to the hearing of anything good
Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him
SERVANT Sir John
FALSTAFF What a young knave and begging Is there not wars Is
there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the
rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but
one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were
it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it
SERVANT You mistake me sir
FALSTAFF Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my
knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I
had said so
SERVANT I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your
soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your
throat if you say I am any other than an honest man
FALSTAFF I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which
Hence Avaunt
SERVANT Sir my lord would speak with you
CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John Falstaff a word with you
FALSTAFF My good lord God give your lordship good time of day I
am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship
was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your
lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack
of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most
humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your
health
CHIEF JUSTICE Sir John I sent for you before your expedition to
Shrewsbury
with some discomfort from Wales
CHIEF JUSTICE I talk not of his Majesty You would not come when I
sent for you
same whoreson apoplexy
CHIEF JUSTICE Well God mend him I pray you let me speak with you
please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson
tingling
CHIEF JUSTICE What tell you me of it Be it as it is
FALSTAFF It hath it original from much grief from study and
perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects
in Galen it is a kind of deafness
hear not what I say to you
is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that
I am troubled withal
CHIEF JUSTICE To punish you by the heels would amend the attention
of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician
FALSTAFF I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your
lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect
of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your
prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or
indeed a scruple itself
CHIEF JUSTICE I sent for you when there were matters against you
for your life to come speak with me
CHIEF JUSTICE Well the truth is Sir John you live in great
infamy
FALSTAFF He that buckles himself in my belt cannot live in less
CHIEF JUSTICE Your means are very slender and your waste is
great
FALSTAFF I would it were otherwise I would my means were greater
and my waist slenderer
CHIEF JUSTICE You have misled the youthful Prince
FALSTAFF The young Prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the
great belly and he my dog
CHIEF JUSTICE But since all is well keep it so wake not a
sleeping wolf
FALSTAFF To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox
CHIEF JUSTICE What you are as a candle the better part burnt
out
wax my growth would approve the truth
CHIEF JUSTICE There is not a white hair in your face but should
have his effect of gravity
FALSTAFF His effect of gravy gravy
CHIEF JUSTICE You follow the young Prince up and down like his
ill angel
FALSTAFF Not so my lord Your ill angel is light but  hope he
that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in some
wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to
man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a
gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us
that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the
bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our
youth must confess are wags too
CHIEF JUSTICE Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth
that are written down old with all the characters of age Have
you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a
decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken
your wind short your chin double your wit single and every
part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call
yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John
FALSTAFF My lord I was born about three of the clock in the
afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my
approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only old
in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for
a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For
sackcloth but in new silk and old sack
CHIEF JUSTICE Well God send the Prince a better companion
FALSTAFF God send the companion a better prince I cannot rid my
hands of him
going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the
Earl of Northumberland
FALSTAFF Yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you
pray all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home that our armies
join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two shirts
out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily If it be a
hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle I would I might
never spit white again There is not a dangerous action can peep
out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I cannot last ever
but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation if they
have a good thing to make it too common If ye will needs say I
am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name
were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with
perpetual motion
CHIEF JUSTICE Well be honest be honest and God bless your
expedition
FALSTAFF Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me
forth
CHIEF JUSTICE Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to
bear crosses Fare you well Commend me to my cousin

other and so both the degrees prevent my curses Boy

purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease
is incurable Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this

Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I

SCENE III
Enter the ARCHBISHOP THOMAS MOWBRAY the EARL MARSHAL LORD HASTINGS
and LORD BARDOLPH
ARCHBISHOP Thus have you heard our cause and known our means
And my most noble friends I pray you all
And first Lord Marshal what say you to it
MOWBRAY I well allow the occasion of our amis
But gladly would be better satisfied
How in our means we should advance ourselves
To look with forehead bold and big enough
Upon the power and puissance of the King
HASTINGS Our present musters grow upon the file
To five and twenty thousand men of choice
And our supplies live largely in the hope
Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns
With an incensed fire of injuries
LORD BARDOLPH The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus
Whether our present five and twenty thousand
May hold up head without Northumberland
HASTINGS With him we may
But if without him we be thought too feeble
My judgment is we should not step too far
Till we had his assistance by the hand
Conjecture expectation and surmise
Of aids incertain should not be admitted
Eating the air and promise of supply
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts
And so with great imagination
Proper to madmen led his powers to death
And winking leapt into destruction
HASTINGS But by your leave it never yet did hurt
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope
Lives so in hope as in an early spring
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
That frosts will bite them When we mean to build
We first survey the plot then draw the model
And when we see the figure of the house
Then we must rate the cost of the erection
Which if we find outweighs ability
What do we then but draw anew the model
In fewer offices or at least desist
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
The plot of situation and the model
Consent upon a sure foundation
Question surveyors know our own estate
To weigh against his opposite or else
We fortify in paper and in figures
Using the names of men instead of men
Like one that draws the model of a house
Beyond his power to build it who half through
A naked subject to the weeping clouds
The utmost man of expectation
I think we are so a body strong enough
Even as we are to equal with the King
LORD BARDOLPH What is the King but five and twenty thousand
HASTINGS To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph
For his divisions as the times do brawl
Are in three heads one power against the French
And one against Glendower perforce a third
Must take up us So is the unfirm King
In three divided and his coffers sound
With hollow poverty and emptiness
ARCHBISHOP That he should draw his several strengths together
And come against us in full puissance
Need not be dreaded
HASTINGS If he should do so
Baying at his heels Never fear that
LORD BARDOLPH Who is it like should lead his forces hither
HASTINGS The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland
Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth
But who is substituted against the French
I have no certain notice
ARCHBISHOP Let us on
And publish the occasion of our arms
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice
An habitation giddy and unsure
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart
O thou fond many with what loud applause
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be
Thou beastly feeder art so full of him
So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up
When through proud London he came sighing on
Past and to come seems best things present worst
MOWBRAY Shall we go draw our numbers and set on
Exeunt

London Another street
Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS
PRINCE Before God I am exceeding weary
PRINCE Faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of
my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to
desire small beer
POINS Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to
remember so weak a composition
troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But
indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my
greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or
one for superfluity and another for use But that the
linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast
not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries
have made a shift to eat up thy holland And God knows whether
those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his
kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault
whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily
strengthened
POINS How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you
should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would
do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is
PRINCE Shall I tell thee one thing Poins
POINS Yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing
PRINCE It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine
POINS Go to I stand the push of your one thing that you will
tell
PRINCE Marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now
sad and sad indeed too
POINS Very hardly upon such a subject
as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end
try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my
father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath
in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow
POINS The reason
PRINCE What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep
POINS I would think thee a most princely hypocrite
me an hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful
thought to think so
POINS Why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to
Falstaff
PRINCE And to thee
POINS By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine
own ears The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second
brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two
things I confess I cannot help By the mass here comes

PRINCE I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my dog
and he holds his place for look you how he writes
as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that
are kin to the King for they never prick their finger but they
says he that takes upon him not to conceive The answer is as
PRINCE Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from
the son of the King nearest his father Harry Prince of Wales
POINS Why this is a certificate
leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses thy
favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell
Repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell
JOHN with my brothers and sisters and SIR JOHN with
me thus Ned Must I marry your sister
POINS God send the wench no worse fortune But I never said so

Warkworth Before the castle
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND LADY NORTHUMBERLAND and LADY PERCY
NORTHUMBERLAND I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter
Give even way unto my rough affairs
Put not you on the visage of the times
And be like them to Percy troublesome
LADY NORTHUMBERLAND I have given over I will speak no more
Do what you will your wisdom be your guide
NORTHUMBERLAND Alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn
And but my going nothing can redeem it
The time was father that you broke your word
Threw many a northward look to see his father
Bring up his powers but he did long in vain
Who then persuaded you to stay at home
For yours the God of heaven brighten it
For his it stuck upon him as the sun
In the grey vault of heaven and by his light
Did all the chivalry of England move
To do brave acts He was indeed the glass
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves
And speaking thick which nature made his blemish
Became the accents of the valiant
For those who could speak low and tardily
Would turn their own perfection to abuse
To seem like him so that in speech in gait
In diet in affections of delight
In military rules humours of blood
He was the mark and glass copy and book
To look upon the hideous god of war
In disadvantage to abide a field
Did seem defensible So you left him
Never O never do his ghost the wrong
To hold your honour more precise and nice
With others than with him Let them alone
The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers
NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew your heart
Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me
With new lamenting ancient oversights
But I must go and meet with danger there
Or it will seek me in another place
And find me worse provided
LADY NORTHUMBERLAND O fly to Scotland
Till that the nobles and the armed commons
Have of their puissance made a little taste
LADY PERCY If they get ground and vantage of the King
Then join you with them like a rib of steel
To make strength stronger but for all our loves
First let them try themselves So did your son
And never shall have length of life enough
To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes
That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven
For recordation to my noble husband
Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop
But many thousand reasons hold me back
I will resolve for Scotland There am I
Till time and vantage crave my company               Exeunt

Westminster The palace
Enter the KING in his nightgown with a page
KING Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick
And well consider of them Make good speed        Exit page
How many thousands of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep O sleep O gentle sleep
That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down
And steep my senses in forgetfulness
Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
Under the canopies of costly state
O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
In cradle of the rude imperious surge
And in the visitation of the winds
Who take the ruffian billows by the top
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds
That with the hurly death itself awakes
Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose
And in the calmest and most stillest night
With all appliances and means to boot
Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
Enter WARWICK and Surrey
WARWICK Many good morrows to your Majesty
KING Is it good morrow lords
KING Why then good morrow to you all my lords
WARWICK We have my liege
KING Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
How foul it is what rank diseases grow
And with what danger near the heart of it
WARWICK It is but as a body yet distempered
Which to his former strength may be restored
With good advice and little medicine
KING O God that one might read the book of fate
And see the revolution of the times
Make mountains level and the continent
Weary of solid firmness melt itself
Into the sea and other times to see
The beachy girdle of the ocean
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors O if this were seen
The happiest youth viewing his progress through
What perils past what crosses to ensue
Would shut the book and sit him down and die
Since Richard and Northumberland great friends
Did feast together and in two years after
Were they at wars It is but eight years since
This Percy was the man nearest my soul
And laid his love and life under my foot
Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard
When Richard with his eye brim full of tears
Though then God knows I had no such intent
And the division of our amity
With a near aim of the main chance of things
As yet not come to life who in their seeds
And weak beginning lie intreasured
Such things become the hatch and brood of time
And by the necessary form of this
King Richard might create a perfect guess
That great Northumberland then false to him
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness
Which should not find a ground to root upon
Unless on you
KING Are these things then necessities
Then let us meet them like necessities
And that same word even now cries out on us
They say the Bishop and Northumberland
Are fifty thousand strong
WARWICK It cannot be my lord
Rumour doth double like the voice and echo
The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace
To go to bed Upon my soul my lord
The powers that you already have sent forth
Shall bring this prize in very easily
A certain instance that Glendower is dead
Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill
And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad
Unto your sickness
KING I will take your counsel
And were these inward wars once out of hand
We would dear lords unto the Holy Land            Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
Yorkshire Within the Forest of Gaultree
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK MOWBRAY HASTINGS and others
ARCHBISHOP Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth
To know the numbers of our enemies
HASTINGS We have sent forth already
My friends and brethren in these great affairs
Their cold intent tenour and substance thus
Here doth he wish his person with such powers
As might hold sortance with his quality
The which he could not levy whereupon
To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers
That your attempts may overlive the hazard
And fearful meeting of their opposite
MOWBRAY Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
And dash themselves to pieces
Enter A MESSENGER
HASTINGS Now what news
MESSENGER West of this forest scarcely off a mile
In goodly form comes on the enemy
And by the ground they hide I judge their number
Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand
MOWBRAY The just proportion that we gave them out
Let us sway on and face them in the field
Enter WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland
WESTMORELAND Health and fair greeting from our general
The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster
ARCHBISHOP Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace
What doth concern your coming
WESTMORELAND Then my lord
Unto your Grace do I in chief address
The substance of my speech If that rebellion
Came like itself in base and abject routs
Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags
In his true native and most proper shape
You reverend father and these noble lords
Had not been here to dress the ugly form
Of base and bloody insurrection
With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop
Whose white investments figure innocence
Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace
Turning your books to graves your ink to blood
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
To a loud trumpet and a point of war
ARCHBISHOP Wherefore do I this So the question stands
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever
And we must bleed for it of which disease
Our late King Richard being infected died
But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland
I take not on me here as a physician
Nor do I as an enemy to peace
Troop in the throngs of military men
But rather show awhile like fearful war
To diet rank minds sick of happiness
Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly
What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer
And find our griefs heavier than our offences
We see which way the stream of time doth run
By the rough torrent of occasion
And have the summary of all our griefs
When time shall serve to show in articles
And might by no suit gain our audience
We are denied access unto his person
Even by those men that most have done us wrong
The dangers of the days but newly gone
Whose memory is written on the earth
With yet appearing blood and the examples
Not to break peace or any branch of it
But to establish here a peace indeed
Concurring both in name and quality
WESTMORELAND When ever yet was your appeal denied
Wherein have you been galled by the King
That you should seal this lawless bloody book
ARCHBISHOP My brother general the commonwealth
To brother horn an household cruelty
I make my quarrel in particular
WESTMORELAND There is no need of any such redress
Or if there were it not belongs to you
MOWBRAY Why not to him in part and to us all
That feel the bruises of the days before
And suffer the condition of these times
To lay a heavy and unequal hand
Upon our honours
WESTMORELAND O my good Lord Mowbray
Construe the times to their necessities
And you shall say indeed it is the time
And not the King that doth you injuries
Yet for your part it not appears to me
Either from the King or in the present time
That you should have an inch of any ground
MOWBRAY What thing in honour had my father lost
And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he
Being mounted and both roused in their seats
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur
Their armed staves in charge their beavers down
Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke
Then threw he down himself and all their lives
That by indictment and by dint of sword
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke
WESTMORELAND You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
In England the most valiant gentleman
But if your father had been victor there
For all the country in a general voice
Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love
Were set on Hereford whom they doted on
But this is mere digression from my purpose
Here come I from our princely general
To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace
That he will give you audience and wherein
It shall appear that your demands are just
You shall enjoy them everything set off
That might so much as think you enemies
And it proceeds from policy not love
WESTMORELAND Mowbray you overween to take it so
This offer comes from mercy not from fear
Upon mine honour all too confident
To give admittance to a thought of fear
Our battle is more full of names than yours
Our men more perfect in the use of arms
Our armour all as strong our cause the best
Then reason will our hearts should be as good
MOWBRAY Well by my will we shall admit no parley
WESTMORELAND That argues but the shame of your offence
A rotten case abides no handling
HASTINGS Hath the Prince John a full commission
In very ample virtue of his father
To hear and absolutely to determine
Of what conditions we shall stand upon
I muse you make so slight a question
ARCHBISHOP Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule
For this contains our general grievances
All members of our cause both here and hence
That are insinewed to this action
Acquitted by a true substantial form
And present execution of our wills
We come within our awful banks again
And knit our powers to the arm of peace
WESTMORELAND This will I show the general Please you lords
In sight of both our battles we may meet
Which must decide it
ARCHBISHOP My lord we will do so          Exit WESTMORELAND
MOWBRAY There is a thing within my bosom tells me
That no conditions of our peace can stand
HASTINGS Fear you not that if we can make our peace
Upon such large terms and so absolute
As our conditions shall consist upon
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains
MOWBRAY Yea but our valuation shall be such
Yea every idle nice and wanton reason
Shall to the King taste of this action
That were our royal faiths martyrs in love
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
And good from bad find no partition
ARCHBISHOP No no my lord Note this the King is weary
Of dainty and such picking grievances
For he hath found to end one doubt by death
Revives two greater in the heirs of life
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
That may repeat and history his los
To new remembrance For full well he knows
He cannot so precisely weed this land
As his misdoubts present occasion
His foes are so enrooted with his friends
That plucking to unfix an enemy
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend
So that this land like an offensive wife
As he is striking holds his infant up
HASTINGS Besides the King hath wasted all his rods
On late offenders that he now doth lack
The very instruments of chastisement
So that his power like to a fangless lion
May offer but not hold
If we do now make our atonement well
Our peace will like a broken limb united
Grow stronger for the breaking
MOWBRAY Be it so
WESTMORELAND The Prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship
ARCHBISHOP Before and greet his Grace My lord we come
Exeunt
SCENE II
Another part of the forest
Enter from one side MOWBRAY attended afterwards the ARCHBISHOP
HASTINGS and others from the other side PRINCE JOHN of LANCASTER
WESTMORELAND OFFICERS and others
Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop
And so to you Lord Hastings and to all
When that your flock assembled by the bell
Encircled you to hear with reverence
Your exposition on the holy text
Than now to see you here an iron man
Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum
Turning the word to sword and life to death
And ripens in the sunshine of his favour
Would he abuse the countenance of the king
Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach
In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop
It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken
How deep you were within the books of God
To us the speaker in His parliament
The very opener and intelligencer
Between the grace the sanctities of heaven
And our dull workings O who shall believe
But you misuse the reverence of your place
Under the counterfeited zeal of God
The subjects of His substitute my father
And both against the peace of heaven and him
ARCHBISHOP Good my Lord of Lancaster
But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
To hold our safety up I sent your Grace
The parcels and particulars of our grief
Whereon this hydra son of war is born
With grant of our most just and right desires
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty
MOWBRAY If not we ready are to try our fortunes
To the last man
HASTINGS And though we here fall down
We have supplies to second our attempt
If they miscarry theirs shall second them
And so success of mischief shall be born
And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
Whiles England shall have generation
PRINCE JOHN YOU are too shallow Hastings much to shallow
WESTMORELAND Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
How far forth you do like their articles
PRINCE JOHN I like them all and do allow them well
And swear here by the honour of my blood
And some about him have too lavishly
Wrested his meaning and authority
Upon my soul they shall If this may please you
Discharge your powers unto their several counties
As we will ours and here between the armies
That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
Of our restored love and amity
ARCHBISHOP I take your princely word for these redresses
PRINCE JOHN I give it you and will maintain my word
And thereupon I drink unto your Grace
HASTINGS Go Captain and deliver to the army
This news of peace Let them have pay and part
I know it will please them Hie thee Captain
Exit Officer
ARCHBISHOP To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland
WESTMORELAND I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains
You would drink freely but my love to ye
Shall show itself more openly hereafter
ARCHBISHOP I do not doubt you
WESTMORELAND I am glad of it
Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray
MOWBRAY You wish me health in very happy season
For I am on the sudden something ill
ARCHBISHOP Against ill chances men are ever merry
But heaviness foreruns the good event
WESTMORELAND Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow
ARCHBISHOP Believe me I am passing light in spirit
MOWBRAY So much the worse if your own rule be true
MOWBRAY This had been cheerful after victory
ARCHBISHOP A peace is of the nature of a conquest
And neither party loser
PRINCE JOHN Go my lord
And let our army be discharged too
Exit WESTMORELAND
And good my lord so please you let our trains
March by us that we may peruse the men
ARCHBISHOP Go good Lord Hastings
Exit HASTINGS
Now cousin wherefore stands our army still
WESTMORELAND The leaders having charge from you to stand
Will not go off until they hear you speak
PRINCE JOHN They know their duties
East west north south or like a school broke up
WESTMORELAND Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which
I do arrest thee traitor of high treason
And you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray
Of capital treason I attach you both
MOWBRAY Is this proceeding just and honourable
WESTMORELAND Is your assembly so
ARCHBISHOP Will you thus break your faith
Whereof you did complain which by mine honour
I will perform with a most Christian care
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours
Most shallowly did you these arms commence
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence
Some guard these traitors to the block of death

old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with
score and odd posts and here travel tainted as I am have in
my pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Colville of the
Dalea most furious knight and valorous enemy But what of that

Exeunt all but FALSTAFF
operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all
the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it
apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and
which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of
your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before
cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the
badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it
and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes It
illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the
rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital
commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their
that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets
till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes
it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did
naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris
that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons
the first humane principle I would teach them should be to
forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack
Enter BARDOLPH
How now Bardolph

SCENE IV
Westminster The Jerusalem Chamber
Enter the KING PRINCE THOMAS OF CLARENCE PRINCE HUMPHREY OF GLOUCESTER
WARWICK and others
KING Now lords if God doth give successful end
To this debate that bleedeth at our doors
We will our youth lead on to higher fields
And draw no swords but what are sanctified
Our substitutes in absence well invested
And everything lies level to our wish
Only we want a little personal strength
And pause us till these rebels now afoot
Come underneath the yoke of government
WARWICK Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
Shall soon enjoy
KING Humphrey my son of Gloucester
Where is the Prince your brother
KING And how accompanied
PRINCE HUMPHREY I do not know my lord
KING Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him
PRINCE HUMPHREY No my good lord he is in presence here
CLARENCE What would my lord and father
KING Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence
How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother
He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas
Thou hast a better place in his affection
Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy
And noble offices thou mayst effect
Of mediation after I am dead
Between his greatness and thy other brethren
Therefore omit him not blunt not his love
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
By seeming cold or careless of his will
He hath a tear for pity and a hand
Open as day for melting charity
As humorous as winter and as sudden
As flaws congealed in the spring of day
Chide him for faults and do it reverently
But being moody give him line and scope
Till that his passions like a whale on ground
Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in
That the united vessel of their blood
Shall never leak though it do work as strong
As aconitum or rash gunpowder
CLARENCE I shall observe him with all care and love
KING Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas
KING And how accompanied Canst thou tell that
CLARENCE With Poins and other his continual followers
KING Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds
And he the noble image of my youth
Is overspread with them therefore my grief
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
And rotten times that you shall look upon
When I am sleeping with my ancestors
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors
When means and lavish manners meet together
O with what wings shall his affections fly
WARWICK My gracious lord you look beyond him quite
The Prince but studies his companions
Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language
Your Highness knows comes to no further use
But to be known and hated So like gross terms
The Prince will in the perfectness of time
Cast off his followers and their memory
Shall as a pattern or a measure live
By which his Grace must mete the lives of other
Turning past evils to advantages
In the dead carrion
Enter WESTMORELAND
WESTMORELAND Health to my sovereign and new happiness
Added to that that am to deliver
Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all
Are brought to the correction of your law
But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere
The manner how this action hath been borne
Here at more leisure may your Highness read
With every course in his particular
KING O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird
Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
The lifting up of day
Enter HARCOURT
HARCOURT From enemies heaven keep your Majesty
And when they stand against you may they fall
As those that I am come to tell you of
The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph
With a great power of English and of Scots
Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown
The manner and true order of the fight
This packet please it you contains at large
KING And wherefore should these good news make me sick
Will Fortune never come with both hands full
But write her fair words still in foulest letters
That have abundance and enjoy it not
I should rejoice now at this happy news
And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy
O me come near me now I am much ill
PRINCE HUMPHREY Comfort your Majesty
CLARENCE O my royal father
WESTMORELAND My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up
WARWICK Be patient Princes you do know these fits
Are with his Highness very ordinary
CLARENCE No no he cannot long hold out these pangs
Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
So thin that life looks through and will break out
PRINCE HUMPHREY The people fear me for they do observe
The seasons change their manners as the year
Had found some months asleep and leapt them over
Say it did so a little time before
WARWICK Speak lower Princes for the King recovers
PRINCE HUMPHREY This apoplexy will certain be his end
KING I pray you take me up and bear me hence
Into some other chamber Softly pray                Exeunt
SCENE V
Westminster Another chamber
The KING lying on a bed CLARENCE GLOUCESTER WARWICK
and others in attendance
KING Let there be no noise made my gentle friends
Unless some dull and favourable hand
Will whisper music to my weary spirit
WARWICK Call for the music in the other room
KING Set me the crown upon my pillow here
CLARENCE His eye is hollow and he changes much
WARWICK Less noise less noise
Enter PRINCE HENRY
PRINCE Who saw the Duke of Clarence
CLARENCE I am here brother full of heaviness
PRINCE How now Rain within doors and none abroad
How doth the King
PRINCE HUMPHREY Exceeding ill
PRINCE Heard he the good news yet Tell it him
WARWICK Not so much noise my lords Sweet Prince speak low
CLARENCE Let us withdraw into the other room
PRINCE No I will sit and watch here by the King
Exeunt all but the PRINCE
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
Being so troublesome a bedfellow
To many a watchful night Sleep with it now
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
Snores out the watch of night O majesty
When thou dost pinch thy bearer thou dost sit
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day
There lies a downy feather which stirs not
Did he suspire that light and weightless down
Perforce must move My gracious lord my father
This sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep
So many English kings Thy due from me
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood
Which nature love and filial tenderness
Shall O dear father pay thee plenteously
My due from thee is this imperial crown
Which as immediate from thy place and blood
Into one giant arm it shall not force
This lineal honour from me This from thee
KING Warwick Gloucester Clarence
CLARENCE Doth the King call
WARWICK What would your Majesty How fares your Grace
KING Why did you leave me here alone my lords
CLARENCE We left the Prince my brother here my liege
Who undertook to sit and watch by you
KING The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him
He is not here
WARWICK This door is open he is gone this way
KING Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow
WARWICK When we withdrew my liege we left it here
Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
My sleep my death
Find him my lord of Warwick chide him hither
Exit WARWICK
This part of his conjoins with my disease
And helps to end me See sons what things you are
How quickly nature falls into revolt
When gold becomes her object
Have broke their sleep with thoughts
Their brains with care their bones with industry
For this they have been thoughtful to invest
Their sons with arts and martial exercises
When like the bee tolling from every flower
The virtuous sweets
We bring it to the hive and like the bees
Yields his engrossments to the ending father
Now where is he that will not stay so long
WARWICK My lord I found the Prince in the next room
Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks
With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow
KING But wherefore did he take away the crown
Lo where he comes Come hither to me Harry
Depart the chamber leave us here alone
Exeunt all but the KING and the PRINCE
PRINCE I never thought to hear you speak again
KING Thy wish was father Harry to that thought
I stay too long by thee I weary thee
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth
Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity
Is held from falling with so weak a wind
That it will quickly drop my day is dim
Were thine without offense and at my death
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
To stab at half an hour of my life
What canst thou not forbear me half an hour
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
That thou art crowned not that I am dead
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head
Only compound me with forgotten dust
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms
Pluck down my officers break my decrees
Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence
And to the English court assemble now
From every region apes of idleness
Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum
Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance
Revel the night rob murder and commit
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways
Be happy he will trouble you no more
England shall double gild his treble guilt
England shall give him office honour might
The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent
O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows
When that my care could not withhold thy riots
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care
O thou wilt be a wilderness again
Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants
PRINCE O pardon me my liege But for my tears
The moist impediments unto my speech
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
The course of it so far There is your crown
And he that wears the crown immortally
Than as your honour and as your renown
Let me no more from this obedience rise
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending
God witness with me when I here came in
And found no course of breath within your Majesty
How cold it struck my heart If I do feign
O let me in my present wildness die
The noble change that I have purposed
I spake unto this crown as having sense
Hath fed upon the body of my father
Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold
Other less fine in carat is more precious
Accusing it I put it on my head
The quarrel of a true inheritor
But if it did infect my blood with joy
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
Did with the least affection of a welcome
Give entertainment to the might of it
Let God for ever keep it from my head
And make me as the poorest vassal is
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it
KING O my son
God put it in thy mind to take it hence
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it
Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed
And hear I think the very latest counsel
That ever I shall breathe God knows my son
I met this crown and I myself know well
How troublesome it sat upon my head
To thee it shall descend with better quiet
Better opinion better confirmation
For all the soil of the achievement goes
And I had many living to upbraid
My gain of it by their assistances
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed
Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears
Thou seest with peril I have answered
For all my reign hath been but as a scene
Acting that argument And now my death
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort
Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green
And all my friends which thou must make thy friends
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
I cut them off and had a purpose now
To lead out many to the Holy Land
Lest rest and lying still might make them look
Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out
May waste the memory of the former days
More would I but my lungs are wasted so
That strength of speech is utterly denied me
How I came by the crown O God forgive
And grant it may with thee in true peace live
PRINCE My gracious liege
You won it wore it kept it gave it me
Then plain and right must my possession be
Which I with more than with a common pain
Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER WARWICK LORDS and others
KING Look look here comes my John of Lancaster
PRINCE JOHN Health peace and happiness to my royal father
But health alack with youthful wings is flown
My worldly business makes a period
Where is my Lord of Warwick
PRINCE My Lord of Warwick
KING Doth any name particular belong
Unto the lodging where I first did swoon
KING Laud be to God Even there my life must end
It hath been prophesied to me many years
I should not die but in Jerusalem
In that Jerusalem shall Harry die                    Exeunt

Visor is an arrant knave on my knowledge

like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned
conjunction with the participation of society that they flock
together in consent like so many wild geese If I had a suit to
Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of
being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master
Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is
certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught
as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed
of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow
to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six
without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight
oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till
his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up
FALSTAFF I come Master Shallow I come Master Shallow
Exit
SCENE II
Westminster The palace
Enter severally WARWICK and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE
WARWICK How now my Lord Chief Justice whither away
CHIEF JUSTICE How doth the King
WARWICK Exceeding well his cares are now all ended
CHIEF JUSTICE I hope not dead
And to our purposes he lives no more
The service that I truly did his life
Hath left me open to all injuries
WARWICK Indeed I think the young king loves you not
CHIEF JUSTICE I know he doth not and do arm myself
To welcome the condition of the time
Which cannot look more hideously upon me
Than I have drawn it in my fantasy
Enter LANCASTER CLARENCE GLOUCESTER
WESTMORELAND and others
WARWICK Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry
O that the living Harry had the temper
Of he the worst of these three gentlemen
How many nobles then should hold their places
That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort
PRINCE JOHN Good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow
GLOUCESTER & CLARENCE Good morrow cousin
PRINCE JOHN We meet like men that had forgot to speak
WARWICK We do remember but our argument
Is all too heavy to admit much talk
PRINCE JOHN Well peace be with him that hath made us heavy
CHIEF JUSTICE Peace be with us lest we be heavier
PRINCE HUMPHREY O good my lord you have lost a friend indeed
And I dare swear you borrow not that face
You stand in coldest expectation
CLARENCE Well you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair
Which swims against your stream of quality
CHIEF JUSTICE Sweet Princes what I did I did in honour
And never shall you see that I will beg
If truth and upright innocency fail me
And tell him who hath sent me after him
WARWICK Here comes the Prince
Enter KING HENRY THE FIFTH attended
CHIEF JUSTICE Good morrow and God save your Majesty
KING This new and gorgeous garment majesty
Sits not so easy on me as you think
Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear
This is the English not the Turkish court
Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds
But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers
For by my faith it very well becomes you
Sorrow so royally in you appears
That I will deeply put the fashion on
And wear it in my heart Why then be sad
But entertain no more of it good brothers
Than a joint burden laid upon us all
But Harry lives that shall convert those tears
By number into hours of happiness
BROTHERS We hope no otherwise from your Majesty
KING You all look strangely on me and you most
Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me
KING No
How might a prince of my great hopes forget
So great indignities you laid upon me
What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison
CHIEF JUSTICE I then did use the person of your father
The image of his power lay then in me
Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth
Your Highness pleased to forget my place
The majesty and power of law and justice
The image of the King whom I presented
And struck me in my very seat of judgment
Whereon as an offender to your father
I gave bold way to my authority
And did commit you If the deed were ill
Be you contented wearing now the garland
To have a son set your decrees at nought
To pluck down justice from your awful bench
To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
That guards the peace and safety of your person
Nay more to spurn at your most royal image
And mock your workings in a second body
Question your royal thoughts make the case yours
Be now the father and propose a son
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted
And then imagine me taking your part
And in your power soft silencing your son
After this cold considerance sentence me
And as you are a king speak in your state
What I have done that misbecame my place
KING You are right Justice and you weigh this well
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword
And I do wish your honours may increase
Till you do live to see a son of mine
Offend you and obey you as I did
That dares do justice on my proper son
And not less happy having such a son
That would deliver up his greatness so
For which I do commit into your hand
With the like bold just and impartial spirit
You shall be as a father to my youth
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear
And I will stoop and humble my intents
And Princes all believe me I beseech you
My father is gone wild into his grave
For in his tomb lie my affections
And with his spirits sadly I survive
To mock the expectation of the world
To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
Rotten opinion who hath writ me down
After my seeming The tide of blood in me
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
And flow henceforth in formal majesty
Now call we our high court of parliament
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
That the great body of our state may go
That war or peace or both at once may be
As things acquainted and familiar to us
In which you father shall have foremost hand
Our coronation done we will accite
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say

So will I those that kept me company
When thou dost hear I am as I have been
Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast
The tutor and the feeder of my riots
Till then I banish thee on pain of death
As I have done the rest of my misleaders

EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
First my fear then my curtsy last my speech My fear is your
displeasure my curtsy my duty and my speech to beg your pardons
If you look for a good speech now you undo me for what I have to say
is of mine own making and what indeed I should say will I doubt
prove mine own marring But to the purpose and so to the venture
Be it known to you as it is very well I was lately here in the end
of a displeasing play to pray your patience for it and to promise you
a better I meant indeed to pay you with this which if like an
ill venture it come unluckily home I break and you my gentle
my body to your mercies Bate me some and I will pay you some and
as most debtors do promise you infinitely and so I kneel down before
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me will you command me to
your debt But a good conscience will make any possible
satisfaction and so would I All the gentlewomen here have forgiven
me If the gentlemen will not then the gentlemen do not agree with
the gentlewomen which was never seen before in such an assembly
meat our humble author will continue the story with Sir John in
it and make you merry with fair Katherine of France where for
killed with your hard opinions for Oldcastle died a martyr and this
is not the man My tongue is weary when my legs are too I will bid
you good night

ACT I SCENE I
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and the BISHOP OF ELY
But that the scambling and unquiet time
Did push it out of farther question
ELY But how my lord shall we resist it now
CANTERBURY It must be thought on If it pass against us
We lose the better half of our possession
For all the temporal lands which men devout
By testament have given to the church
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires
And to relief of lazars and weak age
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil
And to the coffers of the King beside
ELY This would drink deep
ELY But what prevention
CANTERBURY The King is full of grace and fair regard
ELY And a true lover of the holy Church
But that his wildness mortified in him
Consideration like an angel came
Leaving his body as a paradise
Never was such a sudden scholar made
Never came reformation in a flood
With such a heady currance scouring faults
So soon did lose his seat and all at once
As in this king
ELY We are blessed in the change
CANTERBURY Hear him but reason in divinity
You would desire the King were made a prelate
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs
You would say it hath been all in all his study
List his discourse of war and you shall hear
Turn him to any cause of policy
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose
Familiar as his garter that when he speaks
So that the art and practic part of life
Must be the mistress to this theoric
Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it
Since his addiction was to courses vain
And never noted in him any study
Any retirement any sequestration
From open haunts and popularity
ELY The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
Under the veil of wildness which no doubt
Grew like the summer grass fastest by night
Unseen yet crescive in his faculty
And therefore we must needs admit the means
How things are perfected
ELY But my good lord
How now for mitigation of this bill
Incline to it or no
CANTERBURY He seems indifferent
Or rather swaying more upon our part
Upon our spiritual convocation
And in regard of causes now in hand
Than ever at one time the clergy yet
Did to his predecessors part withal
CANTERBURY With good acceptance of his Majesty
Save that there was not time enough to hear
The severals and unhidden passages
Of his true tides to some certain dukedoms
And generally to the crown and seat of France
CANTERBURY The French ambassador upon that instant
ELY It is
CANTERBURY Then go we in to know his embassy
Which I could with a ready guess declare
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it
SCENE II
Enter the KING GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER WARWICK WESTMORELAND
and attendants
KING HENRY Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury
EXETER Not here in presence
KING HENRY Send for him good uncle
Before we hear him of some things of weight
That task our thoughts concerning us and France
Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY and
the BISHOP OF ELY
CANTERBURY God and his angels guard your sacred throne
And make you long become it
KING HENRY Sure we thank you
My learned lord we pray you to proceed
And justly and religiously unfold
Why the law Salique that they have in France
Or should or should not bar us in our claim
And God forbid my dear and faithful lord
That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading
Or nicely charge your understanding soul
With opening titles miscreate whose right
Suits not in native colours with the truth
For God doth know how many now in health
Shall drop their blood in approbation
Of what your reverence shall incite us to
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person
We charge you in the name of God take heed
For never two such kingdoms did contend
Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops
Are every one a woe a sore complaint
That makes such waste in brief mortality
Under this conjuration speak my lord
For we will hear note and believe in heart
As pure as sin with baptism
CANTERBURY Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers
That owe yourselves your lives and services
To this imperial throne There is no bar
But this which they produce from Pharamond
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
To be the realm of France and Pharamond
The founder of this law and female bar
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
That the land Salique is in Germany
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe
There left behind and settled certain French
Who holding in disdain the German women
For some dishonest manners of their life
Should be inheritrix in Salique land
Then doth it well appear the Salique law
Was not devised for the realm of France
Nor did the French possess the Salique land
Until four hundred one and twenty years
After defunction of King Pharamond
Who died within the year of our redemption
Beyond the river Sala in the year
Eight hundred five Besides their writers say
King Pepin which deposed Childeric
Did as heir general being descended
Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair
Make claim and title to the crown of France
Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great
Daughter to Charlemain who was the son
To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son
Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet
Could not keep quiet in his conscience
Wearing the crown of France till satisfied
That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare
Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
King Lewis his satisfaction all appear
To hold in right and tide of the female
So do the kings of France unto this day
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
To bar your Highness claiming from the female
And rather choose to hide them in a net
Than amply to imbar their crooked tides
KING HENRY May I with right and conscience make this claim
CANTERBURY The sin upon my head dread sovereign
For in the book of Numbers is it writ
When the man dies let the inheritance
Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord
Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag
Look back into your mighty ancestors
From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit
Making defeat on the fun power of France
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
Forage in blood of French nobility
O noble English that could entertain
With half their forces the full pride of France
And let another half stand laughing by
All out of work and cold for action
ELY Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
And with your puissant arm renew their feats
You are their heir you sit upon their throne
The blood and courage that renowned them
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises
EXETER Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself
As did the former lions of your blood
So hath your Highness never King of England
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
CANTERBURY O let their bodies follow my dear liege
With blood and sword and fire to win your right
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
As never did the clergy at one time
Bring in to any of your ancestors
But lay down our proportions to defend
Against the Scot who will make road upon us
With all advantages
CANTERBURY They of those marches gracious sovereign
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
Our inland from the pilfering borderers
KING HENRY We do not mean the coursing snatchers only
But fear the main intendment of the Scot
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us
Never went with his forces into France
Came pouring like the tide into a breach
With ample and brim fulness of his force
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays
Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns
That England being empty of defence
For hear her but exampled by herself
When all her chivalry hath been in France
And she a mourning widow of her nobles
She hath herself not only well defended
But taken and impounded as a stray
The King of Scots whom she did send to France
And make her chronicle as rich with praise
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries
For once the eagle England being in prey
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat
To tear and havoc more than she can eat
EXETER It follows then the cat must stay at home
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad
For government though high and low and lower
Put into parts doth keep in one consent
Congreeing in a full and natural close
Like music
CANTERBURY Therefore doth heaven divide
The state of man in divers functions
Setting endeavour in continual motion
To which is fixed as an aim or but
Obedience for so work the honey bees
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
The act of order to a peopled kingdom
They have a king and officers of sorts
Where some like magistrates correct at home
Others like merchants venture trade abroad
Others like soldiers armed in their stings
Which pillage they with merry march bring home
Who busied in his majesty surveys
The singing masons building roofs of gold
The civil citizens kneading up the honey
The poor mechanic porters crowding in
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate
The lazy yawning drone I this infer
That many things having full reference
To one consent may work contrariously
As many arrows loosed several ways
Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea
So many a thousand actions once afoot
End in one purpose and be all well home
Without defeat Therefore to France my liege
Divide your happy England into four
Whereof take you one quarter into France
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake
If we with thrice such powers left at home
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog
Let us be worried and our nation lose
The name of hardiness and policy
KING HENRY Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin
Exeunt some attendants
And yours the noble sinews of our power
Ruling in large and ample empery
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn
Tombless with no remembrance over them
Either our history shall with full mouth
Speak freely of our acts or else our grave
Like Turkish mute shall have a tongueless mouth
Enter AMBASSADORS of France
Of our fair cousin Dauphin for we hear
Your greeting is from him not from the King
Freely to render what we have in charge
Or shall we sparingly show you far of
KING HENRY We are no tyrant but a Christian king
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
AMBASSADOR Thus then in few
Your Highness lately sending into France
Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right
Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third
In answer of which claim the Prince our master
Says that you savour too much of your youth
That can be with a nimble galliard won
You cannot revel into dukedoms there
He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit
This tun of treasure and in lieu of this
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks
KING HENRY What treasure uncle
KING HENRY We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us
His present and your pains we thank you for
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
With chaces And we understand him well
Not measuring what use we made of them
And therefore living hence did give ourself
That men are merriest when they are from home
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
When I do rouse me in my throne of France
For that I have laid by my majesty
But I will rise there with so full a glory
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France
Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us
And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows
Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands
Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down
And some are yet ungotten and unborn
But this lies all within the will of God
To whom I do appeal and in whose name
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
To venge me as I may and to put forth
So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin
His jest will savour but of shallow wit
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it
Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well
Exeunt AMBASSADORS
EXETER This was a merry message
KING HENRY We hope to make the sender blush at it
Therefore my lords omit no happy hour
For we have now no thought in us but France
Save those to God that run before our business
Therefore let our proportions for these wars
Be soon collected and all things thought upon
That may with reasonable swiftness ad
More feathers to our wings for God before
Therefore let every man now task his thought
That this fair action may on foot be brought         Exeunt

ACT II PROLOGUE
Flourish Enter CHORUS
CHORUS Now all the youth of England are on fire
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies
Reigns solely in the breast of every man
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse
Following the mirror of all Christian kings
With winged heels as English Mercuries
For now sits Expectation in the air
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
With crowns imperial crowns and coronets
Of this most dreadful preparation
Shake in their fear and with pale policy
Seek to divert the English purposes
O England model to thy inward greatness
Like little body with a mighty heart
What mightst thou do that honour would thee do
Were all thy children kind and natural
But see thy fault France hath in thee found out
A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills
One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third
Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland
If hell and treason hold their promises
The sum is paid the traitors are agreed
The King is set from London and the scene
Is now transported gentles to Southampton
And thence to France shall we convey you safe
And bring you back charming the narrow seas
To give you gentle pass for if we may
But till the King come forth and not till then
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene                 Exit

BARDOLPH Come shall I make you two friends We must to France

Unto the camp and profits will accrue

PISTOL In cash most justly paid
HOSTESS As ever you come of women come in quickly to Sir John

Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter EXETER BEDFORD and WESTMORELAND
BEDFORD Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors
EXETER They shall be apprehended by and by
WESTMORELAND How smooth and even they do bear themselves
As if allegiance in their bosoms sat
Crowned with faith and constant loyalty
BEDFORD The King hath note of all that they intend
By interception which they dream not of
EXETER Nay but the man that was his bedfellow
That he should for a foreign purse so sell
Trumpets sound Enter the KING SCROOP
CAMBRIDGE GREY and attendants
KING HENRY Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard
My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham
And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts
Will cut their passage through the force of France
Doing the execution and the act
For which we have in head assembled them
SCROOP No doubt my liege if each man do his best
KING HENRY I doubt not that since we are well persuaded
We carry not a heart with us from hence
That grows not in a fair consent with ours
Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
Success and conquest to attend on us
Under the sweet shade of your government
With hearts create of duty and of zeal
KING HENRY We therefore have great cause of thankfulness
And shall forget the office of our hand
Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
According to the weight and worthiness
SCROOP So service shall with steeled sinews toil
And labour shall refresh itself with hope
To do your Grace incessant services
KING HENRY We judge no less Uncle of Exeter
Enlarge the man committed yesterday
It was excess of wine that set him on
And on his more advice we pardon him
Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind
KING HENRY O let us yet be merciful
CAMBRIDGE So may your Highness and yet punish too
GREY Sir
You show great mercy if you give him life
After the taste of much correction
KING HENRY Alas your too much love and care of me
If little faults proceeding on distemper
Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care
And tender preservation of our person
Who are the late commissioners
CAMBRIDGE I one my lord
SCROOP So did you me my liege
GREY And I my royal sovereign
KING HENRY Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours
There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Knight
Grey of Northumberland this same is yours
Read them and know I know your worthiness
My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter
What see you in those papers that you lose
So much complexion Look ye how they change
Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there
Out of appearance
CAMBRIDGE I do confess my fault
GREY SCROOP To which we all appeal
KING HENRY The mercy that was quick in us but late
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms
As dogs upon their masters worrying you
See you my princes and my noble peers
You know how apt our love was to accord
To furnish him with an appertinents
Belonging to his honour and this man
And sworn unto the practices of France
To kill us here in Hampton to the which
This knight no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is hath likewise sworn But O
What shall I say to thee Lord Scroop thou cruel
Ingrateful savage and inhuman creature
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels
May it be possible that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
That though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white my eye will scarcely see it
Treason and murder ever kept together
Working so grossly in a natural cause
That admiration did not whoop at them
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
That wrought upon thee so preposterously
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence
And other devils that suggest by treasons
Do botch and bungle up damnation
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world
He might return to vasty Tartar back
O how hast thou with jealousy infected
The sweetness of affiance Show men dutiful
Why so didst thou Seem they grave and learned
Why so didst thou Come they of noble family
Why so didst thou Seem they religious
Why so didst thou Or are they spare in diet
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
Constant in spirit not swerving with the blood
Not working with the eye without the ear
And but in purged judgment trusting neither
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
With some suspicion I will weep for thee
For this revolt of thine methinks is like
Another fall of man Their faults are open
Arrest them to the answer of the law
And God acquit them of their practices
EXETER I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl
of Cambridge
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Henry Lord Scroop
of Masham
I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Thomas Grey
knight of Northumberland
And I repent my fault more than my death
Which I beseech your Highness to forgive
Although my body pay the price of it
CAMBRIDGE For me the gold of France did not seduce
Although I did admit it as a motive
The sooner to effect what I intended
But God be thanked for prevention
Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice
Beseeching God and you to pardon me
GREY Never did faithful subject more rejoice
At the discovery of most dangerous treason
Prevented from a damned enterprise
My fault but not my body pardon sovereign
KING HENRY God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence
Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter
His princes and his peers to servitude
His subjects to oppression and contempt
And his whole kingdom into desolation
Touching our person seek we no revenge
Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws
We do deliver you Get you therefore hence
Poor miserable wretches to your death
The taste whereof God of his mercy give
You patience to endure and true repentance
Of all your dear offences Bear them hence
Exeunt CAMBRIDGE SCROOP and GREY guarded
Now lords for France the enterprise whereof
Shall be to you as us like glorious
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war
Since God so graciously hath brought to light
This dangerous treason lurking in our way
To hinder our beginnings we doubt not now
But every rub is smoothed on our way
Then forth dear countrymen let us deliver
Our puissance into the hand of God
Putting it straight in expedition
Cheerly to sea the signs of war advance
No king of England if not king of France
Flourish Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter PISTOL HOSTESS NYM BARDOLPH and Boy
Staines
PISTOL No for my manly heart doth earn
Bardolph be blithe Nym rouse thy vaunting veins
Boy bristle thy courage up For Falstaff he is dead
And we must earn therefore
heaven or in hell
after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers
there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet
the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone then I
felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold
as any stone
NYM They say he cried out of sack
BARDOLPH And of women
liked
all the riches I got in his service
NYM Shall we shog The King will be gone from Southampton
Look to my chattles and my moveables
Trust none
And Holdfast is the only dog my duck
Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor
To suck to suck the very blood to suck
PISTOL Touch her soft mouth and march
NYM I cannot kiss that is the humour of it but adieu
PISTOL Let housewifery appear keep close I thee command
HOSTESS Farewell adieu                               Exeunt
SCENE IV
Flourish Enter the FRENCH KING the DAUPHIN the DUKES OF BERRI
and BRITAINE the CONSTABLE and others
FRENCH KING Thus comes the English with full power upon us
And more than carefully it us concerns
To answer royally in our defences
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine
Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth
And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch
To line and new repair our towns of war
With men of courage and with means defendant
For England his approaches makes as fierce
As waters to the sucking of a gulf
It fits us then to be as provident
As fear may teach us out of late examples
Left by the fatal and neglected English
Upon our fields
DAUPHIN My most redoubted father
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question
But that defences musters preparations
As were a war in expectation
To view the sick and feeble parts of France
No with no more than if we heard that England
Her sceptre so fantastically borne
By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth
That fear attends her not
CONSTABLE O peace Prince Dauphin
You are too much mistaken in this king
Question your Grace the late ambassadors
With what great state he heard their embassy
How well supplied with noble counsellors
How modest in exception and withal
How terrible in constant resolution
And you shall find his vanities forespent
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus
Covering discretion with a coat of folly
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
That shall first spring and be most delicate
But though we think it so it is no matter
The enemy more mighty than he seems
Which of a weak and niggardly projection
Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
A little cloth
FRENCH KING Think we King Harry strong
And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him
And he is bred out of that bloody strain
That haunted us in our familiar paths
Witness our too much memorable shame
When Cressy battle fatally was struck
Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales
Mangle the work of nature and deface
The patterns that by God and by French fathers
Had twenty years been made This is a stern
Of that victorious stock and let us fear
The native mightiness and fate of him
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Ambassadors from Harry King of England
Do crave admittance to your Majesty
Exeunt MESSENGER and certain LORDS
You see this chase is hotly followed friends
DAUPHIN Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs
Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
Runs far before them Good my sovereign
Take up the English short and let them know
Of what a monarchy you are the head
FRENCH KING From our brother of England
EXETER From him and thus he greets your Majesty
He wills you in the name of God Almighty
That you divest yourself and lay apart
The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven
By custom and the ordinance of times
Unto the crown of France That you may know
In every branch truly demonstrative
Willing you overlook this pedigree
Edward the Third he bids you then resign
Your crown and kingdom indirectly held
From him the native and true challenger
FRENCH KING Or else what follows
EXETER Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown
Even in your hearts there will he rake for it
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming
In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove
That if requiring fail he will compel
And bids you in the bowels of the Lord
Deliver up the crown and to take mercy
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
Opens his vasty jaws and on your head
For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers
That shall be swallowed in this controversy
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here
To whom expressly I bring greeting too
FRENCH KING For us we will consider of this further
Back to our brother of England
DAUPHIN For the Dauphin
I stand here for him What to him from England
EXETER Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt
And anything that may not misbecome
The mighty sender doth he prize you at
Do not in grant of all demands at large
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty
That caves and womby vaultages of France
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
In second accent of his ordinance
DAUPHIN Say if my father render fair return
It is against my will for I desire
Nothing but odds with England To that end
As matching to his youth and vanity
I did present him with the Paris balls
Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe
As we his subjects have in wonder found
Between the promise of his greener days
And these he masters now Now he weighs time
Even to the utmost grain that you shall read
In your own losses if he stay in France
EXETER Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king
Come here himself to question our delay
For he is footed in this land already
A night is but small breath and little pause
To answer matters of this consequence      Flourish Exeunt

In motion of no less celerity
Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen
Embark his royalty and his brave fleet
With silken streamers the young Phorbus fanning
Play with your fancies and in them behold
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea
Breasting the lofty surge O do but think
You stand upon the rivage and behold
For so appears this fleet majestical
Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow
Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy
And leave your England as dead midnight still
Guarded with grandsires babies and old women
With one appearing hair that will not follow
Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege
Behold the ordnance on their carriages
With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur
Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry
Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms
The offer likes not and the nimble gunner
With linstock now the devilish cannon touches
And down goes an before them Still be kind
And eke out our performance with your mind             Exit

SCENE I
France Before Harfleur
Alarum Enter the KING EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER
KING Once more unto the breach dear friends once more
Or close the wall up with our English dead
As modest stillness and humility
But when the blast of war blows in our ears
Then imitate the action of the tiger
Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect
Let it pry through the portage of the head
As fearfully as doth a galled rock
Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide
Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
To his full height On on you noblest English
Fathers that like so many Alexanders
Have in these parts from morn till even fought
Dishonour not your mothers now attest
Be copy now to men of grosser blood
And teach them how to war And you good yeomen
Whose limbs were made in England show us here
The mettle of your pasture let us swear
For there is none of you so mean and base
That hath not noble lustre in your eyes
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips
Follow your spirit and upon this charge

leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are
sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a
gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my
for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and
seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak
stomach and therefore I must cast it up               Exit

SCENE III
Before the gates of Harfleur
Enter the GOVERNOR and some citizens on the walls  Enter the KING
and all his train before the gates
KING HENRY How yet resolves the Governor of the town
This is the latest parle we will admit
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves
Or like to men proud of destruction
Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best
Till in her ashes she lie buried
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass
What is it then to me if impious war
If your pure maidens fall into the hand
Of hot and forcing violation
What rein can hold licentious wickednes
When down the hill he holds his fierce career
We may as bootless spend our vain command
As send precepts to the Leviathan
To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur
Take pity of your town and of your people
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
Of heady murder spoil and villainy
The blind and bloody with foul hand
Your fathers taken by the silver beards
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes
Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry
What say you Will you yield and this avoid
GOVERNOR Our expectation hath this day an end
The Dauphin whom of succours we entreated
Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
To raise so great a siege Therefore great King
We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy
Enter our gates dispose of us and ours
For we no longer are defensible
Go you and enter Harfleur there remain
Use mercy to them all For us dear uncle
The winter coming on and sickness growing
Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais

the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE and others
CONSTABLE And if he be not fought withal my lord
Let us not live in France let us quit an
And give our vineyards to a barbarous people
DAUPHIN O Dieu vivant Shall a few sprays of us
Our scions put in wild and savage stock
Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
And overlook their grafters
BRITAINE Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards
Mort Dieu ma vie if they march along
Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom
CONSTABLE Dieu de batailles where have they this mettle
Is not their climate foggy raw and dull
On whom as in despite the sun looks pale
Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water
Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat
And shall our quick blood spirited with wine
Seem frosty O for honour of our land
Let us not hang like roping icicles
Poor we call them in their native lords
DAUPHIN By faith and honour
Our madams mock at us and plainly say
Our mettle is bred out and they will give
Their bodies to the lust of English youth
And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos
Saying our grace is only in our heels
And that we are most lofty runaways
FRENCH KING Where is Montjoy the herald Speed him hence
Let him greet England with our sharp defiance
Up Princes and with spirit of honour edged
More sharper than your swords hie to the field

High dukes great princes barons lords and knights
For your great seats now quit you of great shames
Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land
With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur
Rush on his host as doth the melted snow
Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon
Go down upon him you have power enough
And in a captive chariot into Rouen
Bring him our prisoner
CONSTABLE This becomes the great
Sorry am I his numbers are so few
For I am sure when he shall see our army
And for achievement offer us his ransom
FRENCH KING Therefore Lord Constable haste on Montjoy
And let him say to England that we send
To know what willing ransom he will give
Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen

GOWER How now Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridge
FLUELLEN I assure you there is very excellent services committed
at the bridge
GOWER Is the Duke of Exeter safe
FLUELLEN The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a
man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my
duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power He is
keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There
very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is
man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as
gallant service
GOWER What do you call him
GOWER I know him not
Enter PISTOL
FLUELLEN Here is the man
PISTOL Captain I thee beseech to do me favours
The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well
FLUELLEN Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his
hands
PISTOL Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart
And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate
That goddess blind
FLUELLEN By your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is painted
blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that
Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to
signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning
and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look
you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and
rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent description
of it Fortune is an excellent moral
A damned death
Let gallows gape for dog let man go free
And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate
But Exeter hath given the doom of death
For pax of little price
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach
Speak Captain for his life and I will thee requite
FLUELLEN Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning
PISTOL Why then rejoice therefore
FLUELLEN Certainly Aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at
for if look you he were my brother I would desire the Duke to
use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline
ought to be used
FLUELLEN It is well
PISTOL The fig of Spain                                 Exit
FLUELLEN Very good
GOWER Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him
has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serve
the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the
form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great
terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the
thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age
or else you may be marvellously mistook
FLUELLEN I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not
the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I
Hark you the King is coming and I must speak with him from the
pridge
Drum and colours Enter the KING and his poor soldiers
and GLOUCESTER
God pless your Majesty
FLUELLEN Ay so please your Majesty The Duke of Exeter has very
athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced
to retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I can
tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man
KING HENRY What men have you lost Fluellen
reasonable great marry for my part I think the Duke hath lost
never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a
lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes
out
KING HENRY We would have all such offenders so cut off And we
give express charge that in our marches through the country there
for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful
language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner
Tucket Enter MONTJOY
MONTJOY You know me by my habit
KING HENRY Well then I know thee what shall I know of thee
KING HENRY Unfold it
MONTJOY Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England Though we
that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full
ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial
England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our
sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must
proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost
pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too
too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling
at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add
defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his
master so much my office
KING HENRY What is thy name I know thy quality
MONTJOY Montjoy
KING HENRY Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back
And tell thy king I do not seek him now
But could be willing to march on to Calais
My people are with sickness much enfeebled
Almost no better than so many French
Who when they were in health I tell thee herald
I thought upon one pair of English legs
Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God
That I do brag thus this your air of France
Hath blown that vice in me I must repent
Go therefore tell thy master here I am
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk
My army but a weak and sickly guard
Yet God before tell him we will come on
Though France himself and such another neighbour
Go bid thy master well advise himself
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well
The sum of all our answer is but this
We would not seek a battle as we are
Nor as we are we say we will not shun it
So tell your master
MONTJOY I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness     Exit
GLOUCESTER I hope they will not come upon us now
March to the bridge it now draws toward night
SCENE VII
The French camp near Agincourt
Enter the CONSTABLE OF FRANCE the LORD RAMBURES the DUKE OF ORLEANS
the DAUPHIN with others
CONSTABLE Tut I have the best armour of the world
Would it were day
ORLEANS You have an excellent armour but let my horse have his
due
CONSTABLE It is the best horse of Europe
ORLEANS Will it never be morning
DAUPHIN My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable you talk of
horse and armour
ORLEANS You are as well provided of both as any prince in the
world
DAUPHIN What a long night is this I will not change my horse with
any that treads but on four pasterns Ca ha he bounds from the
earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the
Pegasus chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I
am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it
the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of
Hermes
DAUPHIN And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus
he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water
never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his
rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you
may call beasts
CONSTABLE Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent
horse
DAUPHIN It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage
ORLEANS No more cousin
DAUPHIN Nay the man hath no wit that cannot from the rising of
the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my
palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into
for my horse is my mistress
ORLEANS Your mistress bears well
DAUPHIN Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a
good and particular mistress
CONSTABLE Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
shook your back
DAUPHIN So perhaps did yours
CONSTABLE Mine was not bridled
DAUPHIN O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a
kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait
strossers
CONSTABLE You have good judgment in horsemanship
warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my
mistress
CONSTABLE I had as lief have my mistress a jade
DAUPHIN I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hair
CONSTABLE I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to
my mistress
CONSTABLE Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such
proverb so little kin to the purpose
RAMBURES My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent
CONSTABLE Stars my lord
CONSTABLE And yet my sky shall not want
more honour some were away
well were some of your brags dismounted
DAUPHIN Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it
paved with English faces
way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about the
ears of the English
RAMBURES Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners
CONSTABLE You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them
ORLEANS The Dauphin longs for morning
RAMBURES He longs to eat the English
CONSTABLE I think he will eat all he kills
CONSTABLE Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath
ORLEANS He is simply the most active gentleman of France
CONSTABLE Doing is activity and he will still be doing
ORLEANS He never did harm that I heard of
still
ORLEANS I know him to be valiant
CONSTABLE I was told that by one that knows him better than you
who knew it
ORLEANS He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him
CONSTABLE By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but
his lackey
CONSTABLE You have shot over
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen
hundred paces of your tents
MESSENGER The Lord Grandpre
CONSTABLE A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day
Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we
ORLEANS What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of
knowledge
CONSTABLE If the English had any apprehension they would run
away
ORLEANS That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual
RAMBURES That island of England breeds very valiant creatures
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage
ORLEANS Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian
lip of a lion
CONSTABLE Just just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs
in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their
wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel
they will eat like wolves and fight like devils
ORLEANS Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef
eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we
about it
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen              Exeunt

ACT IV PROLOGUE
Enter CHORUS
CHORUS Now entertain conjecture of a time
When creeping murmur and the poring dark
Fills the wide vessel of the universe
From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
The hum of either army stilly sounds
Fire answers fire and through their paly flames
Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs
The armourers accomplishing the knights
With busy hammers closing rivets up
Give dreadful note of preparation
The country cocks do crow the clocks do ton
And the third hour of drowsy morning name
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul
Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
So tediously away The poor condemned English
Like sacrifices by their watchful fires
Sit patiently and inly ruminate
Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold
Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent
For forth he goes and visits all his host
Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
And calls them brothers friends and countrymen
Upon his royal face there is no note
How dread an army hath enrounded him
Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty
That every wretch pining and pale before
Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks
A largess universal like the sun
His liberal eye doth give to every one
Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all
Behold as may unworthiness define
A little touch of Harry in the night
And so our scene must to the battle fly
With four or five most vile and ragged foils
The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see
SCENE I
France The English camp at Agincourt
Enter the KING BEDFORD and GLOUCESTER
The greater therefore should our courage be
Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty
There is some soul of goodness in things evil
Would men observingly distil it out
For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers
Which is both healthful and good husbandry
Besides they are our outward consciences
And preachers to us all admonishing
That we should dress us fairly for our end
Thus may we gather honey from the weed
And make a moral of the devil himself
Enter ERPINGHAM
Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham
A good soft pillow for that good white head
Were better than a churlish turf of France
ERPINGHAM Not so my liege this lodging likes me better
Upon example so the spirit is eased
The organs though defunct and dead before
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move
With casted slough and fresh legerity
Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both
Commend me to the princes in our camp
Do my good morrow to them and anon
Desire them all to my pavilion
GLOUCESTER We shall my liege
ERPINGHAM Shall I attend your Grace
KING HENRY No my good knight
Go with my brothers to my lords of England
I and my bosom must debate awhile
And then I would no other company
ERPINGHAM The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry
Exeunt all but the KING
Enter PISTOL
PISTOL Qui va la
KING HENRY A friend
PISTOL Discuss unto me art thou officer
Or art thou base common and popular
KING HENRY I am a gentleman of a company
KING HENRY Even so What are you
PISTOL As good a gentleman as the Emperor
KING HENRY Then you are a better than the King
A lad of life an imp of fame
Of parents good of fist most valiant
I love the lovely bully What is thy name
KING HENRY Harry le Roy
PISTOL Le Roy a Cornish name art thou of Cornish crew
KING HENRY No I am a Welshman
KING HENRY Yes
KING HENRY Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest
he knock that about yours
PISTOL Art thou his friend
KING HENRY And his kinsman too
PISTOL The figo for thee then
KING HENRY I thank you God be with you
KING HENRY It sorts well with your fierceness
Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER
GOWER Captain Fluellen
FLUELLEN So in the name of Jesu Christ speak fewer It is the
greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and
aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you
would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great
ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it
and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise
GOWER Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night
FLUELLEN If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be
an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own
conscience now
GOWER I will speak lower
FLUELLEN I pray you and beseech you that you will
Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN
KING HENRY Though it appear a little out of fashion
There is much care and valour in this Welshman
Enter three soldiers JOHN BATES ALEXANDER COURT
and MICHAEL WILLIAMS
COURT Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks
yonder
BATES I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the
approach of day
WILLIAMS We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we
shall never see the end of it Who goes there
KING HENRY A friend
WILLIAMS Under what captain serve you
KING HENRY Under Sir Thomas Erpingham
WILLIAMS A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray
you what thinks he of our estate
off the next tide
BATES He hath not told his thought to the King
KING HENRY No nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it
to you I think the King is but a man as I am the violet smells
to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to
me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid
by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his
affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop
they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of
fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish
as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any
appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his
army
BATES He may show what outward courage he will but I believe as
neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so
we were quit here
KING HENRY By my troth I will speak my conscience of the King I
think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is
BATES Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be
KING HENRY I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here
company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable
BATES Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if
obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us
WILLIAMS But if the cause be not good the King himself hath a
heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads
for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some
upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I
am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how
can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their
argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black
matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were
against all proportion of subjection
KING HENRY So if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of
his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father
transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in
the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant
for they purpose not their death when they purpose their
services Besides there is no king be his cause never so
spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out
with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the
guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling
virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars
their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace
with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law
and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they
have no wings to fly from God war is His beadle war is His
death they have borne life away and where they would be safe
they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King
guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those
Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man
death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly
lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes
it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer He
let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare
BATES I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine
to fight lustily for him
WILLIAMS Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our
KING HENRY If I live to see it I will never trust his word after
monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with
KING HENRY Your reproof is something too round I should be angry
with you if the time were convenient
WILLIAMS Let it be a quarrel between us if you live
KING HENRY I embrace it
WILLIAMS How shall I know thee again
KING HENRY Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my
my quarrel
KING HENRY There
WILLIAMS This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me
take thee a box on the ear
KING HENRY If ever I live to see it I will challenge it
company
WILLIAMS Keep thy word Fare thee well
BATES Be friends you English fools be friends we have
French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon
KING HENRY Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one
they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it
King himself will be a clipper
Exeunt soldiers
Upon the King Let us our lives our souls
Our debts our careful wives
Our children and our sins lay on the King
We must bear all O hard condition
Of every fool whose sense no more can feel
Must kings neglect that private men enjoy
And what have kings that privates have not too
And what art thou thou idol Ceremony
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers
O Ceremony show me but thy worth
What is thy soul of adoration
Art thou aught else but place degree and form
Creating awe and fear in other men
Than they in fearing
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure
Thinks thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation
Will it give place to flexure and low bending
Command the health of it No thou proud dream
I am a king that find thee and I know
The sword the mace the crown imperial
The intertissued robe of gold and pearl
The farced tide running fore the king
The throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp
No not all these thrice gorgeous ceremony
Not all these laid in bed majestical
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave
Never sees horrid night the child of hell
But like a lackey from the rise to set
Sweats in the eye of Pheebus and all night
Sleeps in Elysium next day after dawn
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse
With profitable labour to his grave
And but for ceremony such a wretch
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep
Enjoys it but in gross brain little wots
What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace
Whose hours the peasant best advantages
Enter ERPINGHAM
ERPINGHAM My lord your nobles jealous of your absence
Seek through your camp to find you
KING Good old knight
Collect them all together at my tent
Possess them not with fear Take from them now
My father made in compassing the crown
And on it have bestowed more contrite tears
Than from it issued forced drops of blood
Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay
Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built
Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests
Though all that I can do is nothing worth
Since that my penitence comes after all
Imploring pardon
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER My liege
I know thy errand I will go with thee
The day my friends and all things stay for me     Exeunt

DAUPHIN Montez a cheval My horse Varlet laquais Ha
ORLEANS O brave spirit
DAUPHIN Ciel cousin Orleans
Enter CONSTABLE
Now my Lord Constable
CONSTABLE Hark how our steeds for present service neigh
DAUPHIN Mount them and make incision in their hides
That their hot blood may spin in English eyes
And dout them with superfluous courage ha
How shall we then behold their natural tears
Enter a MESSENGER
CONSTABLE To horse you gallant Princes straight to horse
Do but behold yon poor and starved band
And your fair show shall suck away their souls
Leaving them but the shales and husks of men
There is not work enough for all our hands
Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them
Who in unnecessary action swarm
To purge this field of such a hilding foe
A very little little let us do
And all is done Then let the trumpets sound
The tucket sonance and the note to mount
For our approach shall so much dare the field
That England shall couch down in fear and yield
Enter GRANDPRE
GRANDPRE Why do you stay so long my lords of France
Yond island carrions desperate of their bones
Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose
And our air shakes them passing scornfully
And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps
The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks
Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips
And their executors the knavish crows
Description cannot suit itself in words
To demonstrate the life of such a battle
In life so lifeless as it shows itself
CONSTABLE They have said their prayers and they stay for death
DAUPHIN Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
And give their fasting horses provender
And after fight with them
CONSTABLE I stay but for my guidon To the field
I will the banner from a trumpet take
And use it for my haste Come come away
The sun is high and we outwear the day              Exeunt
SCENE III
The English camp
Enter GLOUCESTER BEDFORD EXETER ERPINGHAM with all his host
SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND
GLOUCESTER Where is the King
BEDFORD The King himself is rode to view their battle
If we no more meet till we meet in heaven
Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford
My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter
BEDFORD Farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee
And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it
Exit SALISBURY
BEDFORD He is as full of valour as of kindness
Princely in both
Enter the KING
WESTMORELAND O that we now had here
But one ten thousand of those men in England
My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin
To do our country loss and if to live
The fewer men the greater share of honour
By Jove I am not covetous for gold
Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost
It yearns me not if men my garments wear
Such outward things dwell not in my desires
But if it be a sin to covet honour
I am the most offending soul alive
No faith my coz wish not a man from England
As one man more methinks would share from me
For the best hope I have O do not wish one more
Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host
That he which hath no stomach to this fight
Let him depart his passport shall be made
And crowns for convoy put into his purse
That fears his fellowship to die with us
He that outlives this day and comes safe home
And rouse him at the name of Crispian
He that shall live this day and see old age
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars
Old men forget yet all shall be forgot
What feats he did that day Then shall our names
Harry the King Bedford and Exeter
This story shall the good man teach his son
From this day to the ending of the world
We few we happy few we band of brothers
This day shall gentle his condition
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
SALISBURY My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed
The French are bravely in their battles set
And will with all expedience charge on us
KING HENRY All things are ready if our minds be so
WESTMORELAND Perish the man whose mind is backward now
KING HENRY Thou dost not wish more help from England coz
Without more help could fight this royal battle
Which likes me better than to wish us one
You know your places God be with you all
Tucket Enter MONTJOY
MONTJOY Once more I come to know of thee King Harry
If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound
Before thy most assured overthrow
For certainly thou art so near the gulf
Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy
The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
Thy followers of repentance that their souls
May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies
Must lie and fester
KING HENRY Who hath sent thee now
MONTJOY The Constable of France
KING HENRY I pray thee bear my former answer back
Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones
Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus
A many of our bodies shall no doubt
Find native graves upon the which I trust
And those that leave their valiant bones in France
Dying like men though buried in your dunghills
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France
Mark then abounding valour in our English

That I may prompt them and of such as have
Of time of numbers and due course of things
Which cannot in their huge and proper life
Be here presented Now we bear the King
Toward Calais Grant him there There seen
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
Athwart the sea Behold the English beach
Pales in the flood with men with wives and boys
Which like a mighty whiffler fore the King
Seems to prepare his way So let him land
And solemnly see him set on to London
So swift a pace hath thought that even now
You may imagine him upon Blackheath
Where that his lords desire him to have borne
His bruised helmet and his bended sword
Before him through the city He forbids it
Giving full trophy signal and ostent
Quite from himself to God But now behold
How London doth pour out her citizens
As by a lower but loving likelihood
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword
How many would the peaceful city quit
To welcome him Much more and much more cause
As yet the lamentation of the French
To order peace between them and omit
Then brook abridgment and your eyes advance
After your thoughts straight back again to France     Exit

SCENE II
Enter at one door KING HENRY EXETER BEDFORD GLOUCESTER WARWICK
WESTMORELAND and other LORDS at another the FRENCH KING QUEEN ISABEL
the PRINCESS KATHERINE ALICE and other LADIES the DUKE OF BURGUNDY
and his train
KING HENRY Peace to this meeting wherefore we are met
Unto our brother France and to our sister
Health and fair time of day joy and good wishes
To our most fair and princely cousin Katherine
And as a branch and member of this royalty
We do salute you Duke of Burgundy
And princes French and peers health to you all
FRENCH KING Right joyous are we to behold your face
Most worthy brother England fairly met
So are you princes English every one
QUEEN ISABEL So happy be the issue brother England
Of this good day and of this gracious meeting
Your eyes which hitherto have home in them
Against the French that met them in their bent
The fatal balls of murdering basilisks
The venom of such looks we fairly hope
Have lost their quality and that this day
Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love
KING HENRY To cry amen to that thus we appear
QUEEN ISABEL You English princes an I do salute you
BURGUNDY My duty to you both on equal love
With all my wits my pains and strong endeavours
To bring your most imperial Majesties
Unto this bar and royal interview
Your mightiness on both parts best can witness
That face to face and royal eye to eye
You have congreeted let it not disgrace me
If I demand before this royal view
What rub or what impediment there is
Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace
Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births
Should not in this best garden of the world
Our fertile France put up her lovely visage
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps
Corrupting in it own fertility
Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart
Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair
The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory
Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts
That should deracinate such savagery
The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth
The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover
Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank
Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs
Losing both beauty and utility
And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges
Defective in their natures grow to wildness
Even so our houses and ourselves and children
Have lost or do not learn for want of time
The sciences that should become our country
And everything that seems unnatural
Which to reduce into our former favout
You are assembled and my speech entreats
That I may know the let why gentle Peace
Should not expel these inconveniences
And bless us with her former qualities
KING HENRY If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace
Which you have cited you must buy that peace
With full accord to all our just demands
Whose tenours and particular effects
BURGUNDY The King hath heard them to the which as yet
There is no answer made
KING HENRY Well then the peace
FRENCH KING I have but with a cursorary eye
To appoint some of your council presently
To sit with us once more with better heed
Pass our accept and peremptory answer
KING HENRY Brother we shall Go uncle Exeter
And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester
Warwick and Huntington go with the King
And take with you free power to ratify
Augment or alter as your wisdoms best
Shall see advantageable for our dignity
Any thing in or out of our demands
Go with the princes or stay here with us
QUEEN ISABEL Our gracious brother I will go with them
KING HENRY Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us
QUEEN ISABEL She hath good leave
Exeunt all but the KING KATHERINE and ALICE
KING HENRY Fair Katherine and most fair
Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
KATHERINE Your Majesty shall mock me I cannot speak your England
KING HENRY O fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with your
French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with
your English tongue Do you like me Kate
KING HENRY An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel
KING HENRY I said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to
affirm it
KATHERINE O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de
tromperies
KING HENRY What says she fair one that the tongues of men are
full of deceits
de Princess
Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou
canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst
find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my
farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but
you lady
KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur me understand well
KING HENRY Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for
your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither
words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in
measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a
on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I
should quickly leap into wife Or if I might buffet for my love
or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher
cannot look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor I have no
cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use
fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning
that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there
let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou
canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I
plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right
because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these
fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into
What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good
leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will
wither a full eye will wax hollow But a good heart Kate is
it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly
If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a
to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee
KATHERINE Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France
KING HENRY No it is not possible you should love the enemy of
France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of
France for I love France so well that I will not part with a
village of it I will have it all mine And Kate when France is
mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine
KATHERINE I cannot tell vat is dat
KING HENRY No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure
France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to
conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall
never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me
KATHERINE Sauf votre honneur le Francais que vous parlez il est
tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to
be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much
KATHERINE I cannot tell
Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into
know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you
love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the
rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever
thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells
me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore
Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half
English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the
KATHERINE I do not know dat
now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of
such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and
a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon
tres cher et divin deesse
KATHERINE Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
most sage damoiselle dat is en France
KING HENRY Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true
English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou
lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost
notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now
he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with
an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them
But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear
no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the
worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and
better And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you have
me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your
heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say
thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet
fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good
music and thy English broken therefore Queen of all Katherine
break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me
KATHERINE Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere
him Kate
KATHERINE Den it sall also content me
KING HENRY Upon that I kiss your hand and I can you my queen
KATHERINE Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foi je ne
veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main
supplie mon tres puissant seigneur
KING HENRY Then I will kiss your lips Kate
KATHERINE Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur
KING HENRY Madame my interpreter what says she

French council and they should sooner persuade Henry of England
than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father
Enter the FRENCH POWER and the ENGLISH LORDS
BURGUNDY God save your Majesty My royal cousin
Teach you our princess English
KING HENRY I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I
love her and that is good English
BURGUNDY Is she not apt
KING HENRY Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not
smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of
flattery about me I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in
her that he will appear in his true likeness
BURGUNDY Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for
that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if
conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked
with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of
a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a
hard condition for a maid to consign to
KING HENRY Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and
enforces
they do
KING HENRY Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent
winking
BURGUNDY I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach
eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not
abide looking on
KING HENRY This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and
so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she
must be blind too
BURGUNDY As love is my lord before it loves
KING HENRY It is so and you may some of you thank love for my
blindness who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair
French maid that stands in my way
FRENCH KING Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities
turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls
KING HENRY Shall Kate be my wife
FRENCH KING So please you
KING HENRY I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait
on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show
me the way to my will
FRENCH KING We have consented to all terms of reason
WESTMORELAND The king hath granted every article
His daughter first and then in sequel all
According to their firm proposed natures
EXETER Only he hath not yet subscribed this
Where your Majesty demands that the King of France having any
occasion to write for matter of grant shall name your Highness
in this form and with this addition in French Notre tres cher
Latin Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus Rex Angliae et
Haeres Franciae
FRENCH KING Nor this I have not brother so denied
But our request shall make me let it pass
KING HENRY I pray you then in love and dear alliance
Let that one article rank with the rest
And thereupon give me your daughter
FRENCH KING Take her fair son and from her blood raise up
Issue to me that the contending kingdoms
Of France and England whose very shores look pale
May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction
In their sweet bosoms that never war advance
LORDS Amen
KING HENRY Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all
QUEEN ISABEL God the best maker of all marriages
Combine your hearts in one your realms in one
As man and wife being two are one in love
That never may ill office or fell jealousy
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms
To make divorce of their incorporate league
That English may as French French Englishmen
Receive each other God speak this Amen
ALL Amen
KING HENRY Prepare we for our marriage on which day
Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me
Sennet Exeunt
EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
Enter CHORUS
In little room confining mighty men
Mangling by starts the full course of their glory
Small time but in that small most greatly lived
This star of England Fortune made his sword
And of it left his son imperial lord
Of France and England did this king succeed
Whose state so many had the managing
That they lost France and made his England bleed
Which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake
In your fair minds let this acceptance take            Exit

SCENE
England and France
The First Part of King Henry the Sixth
ACT I SCENE 1
Westminster Abbey
Dead March Enter the funeral of KING HENRY THE FIFTH
attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD Regent of France
the DUKE OF GLOUCESTER Protector the DUKE OF EXETER
the EARL OF WARWICK the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER
BEDFORD Hung be the heavens with black yield day to
night Comets importing change of times and states
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long
Virtue he had deserving to command
His sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire
More dazzled and drove back his enemies
What should I say His deeds exceed all speech
EXETER We mourn in black why mourn we not in blood
Henry is dead and never shall revive
Upon a wooden coffin we attend
We with our stately presence glorify
Like captives bound to a triumphant car
What shall we curse the planets of mishap
Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him
So dreadful will not be as was his sight
The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought
GLOUCESTER The Church Where is it Had not churchmen
None do you like but an effeminate prince
Protector
And lookest to command the Prince and realm
Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe
More than God or religious churchmen may
Except it be to pray against thy foes
BEDFORD Cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace
Posterity await for wretched years
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears
And none but women left to wail the dead
HENRY the Fifth thy ghost I invocate
Prosper this realm keep it from civil broils
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens
A far more glorious star thy soul will make
Than Julius Caesar or bright
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER My honourable lords health to you all
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France
Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture
Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans
Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost
Speak softly or the loss of those great towns
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death
GLOUCESTER Is Paris lost Is Rouen yielded up
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost
MESSENGER No treachery but want of men and money
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered
That here you maintain several factions
You are disputing of your generals
Another would fly swift but wanteth wings
A third thinks without expense at all
Awake awake English nobility
EXETER Were our tears wanting to this funeral
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides
BEDFORD Me they concern Regent I am of France
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes
To weep their intermissive miseries
Enter a second MESSENGER
SECOND MESSENGER Lords view these letters full of bad
mischance
France is revolted from the English quite
Except some petty towns of no import
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims
Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side
EXETER The Dauphin crowned king all fly to him
O whither shall we fly from this reproach
Wherewith already France is overrun
Enter a third MESSENGER
THIRD MESSENGER My gracious lords to add to your
laments
I must inform you of a dismal fight
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French
THIRD MESSENGER O no wherein Lord Talbot was
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord
Retiring from the siege of Orleans
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop
By three and twenty thousand of the French
Was round encompassed and set upon
No leisure had he to enrank his men
He wanted pikes to set before his archers
They pitched in the ground confusedly
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in
More than three hours the fight continued
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance
Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre
Enclosed were they with their enemies
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
Durst not presume to look once in the face
BEDFORD Is Talbot slain Then I will slay myself
For living idly here in pomp and ease
Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid
THIRD MESSENGER O no he lives but is took prisoner
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford
BEDFORD His ransom there is none but I shall pay
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend
Farewell my masters to my task will I
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take
Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake
The English army is grown weak and faint
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny
Since they so few watch such a multitude
EXETER Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke
BEDFORD I do remember it and here take my leave
To go about my preparation                             Exit
And then I will proclaim young Henry king              Exit
EXETER To Eltham will I where the young King is
attend
I am left out for me nothing remains
But long I will not be Jack out of office
The King from Eltham I intend to steal
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal             Exeunt
SCENE 2
France Before Orleans
Sound a flourish Enter CHARLES THE DAUPHIN ALENCON
and REIGNIER marching with drum and soldiers
CHARLES Mars his true moving even as in the heavens
So in the earth to this day is not known
Late did he shine upon the English side
Now we are victors upon us he smiles
What towns of any moment but we have
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month
ALENCON They want their porridge and their fat bull
beeves
Either they must be dieted like mules
And have their provender tied to their mouths
Or piteous they will look like drowned mice
Talbot is taken whom we wont to fear
And he may well in fretting spend his gall
Nor men nor money hath he to make war
CHARLES Sound sound alarum we will rush on them
Now for the honour of the forlorn French
Him I forgive my death that killeth me
When he sees me go back one foot or flee             Exeunt
Here alarum They are beaten hack by the English with
CHARLES Who ever saw the like What men have I
But that they left me midst my enemies
REIGNIER Salisbury is a desperate homicide
He fighteth as one weary of his life
The other lords like lions wanting food
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey
ALENCON Froissart a countryman of ours records
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred
During the time Edward the Third did reign
More truly now may this be verified
For none but Samsons and Goliases
It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten
They had such courage and audacity
slaves
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager
Of old I know them rather with their teeth
REIGNIER I think by some odd gimmers or device
Their arms are set like clocks still to strike on
ALENCON Be it so
Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS
CHARLES Bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence
A holy maid hither with me I bring
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
And drive the English forth the bounds of France
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome
Speak shall I call her in Believe my words
For they are certain and unfallible
But first to try her skill
Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place
Question her proudly let thy looks be stern
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath
JOAN LA PUCELLE
Where is the Dauphin Come come from behind
I know thee well though never seen before
In private will I talk with thee apart
Stand back you lords and give us leave awhile
REIGNIER She takes upon her bravely at first dash
To shine on my contemptible estate
Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs
And in a vision full of majesty
And free my country from calamity
And whereas I was black and swart before
Ask me what question thou canst possible
And I will answer unpremeditated
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex
Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me
And if thou vanquishest thy words are true
Otherwise I renounce all confidence
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth
CHARLES Stay stay thy hands thou art an Amazon
And fightest with the sword of Deborah
Impatiently I burn with thy desire
Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be
PUCELLE I must not yield to any rites of love
When I have chased all thy foes from hence
Then will I think upon a recompense
CHARLES Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall
REIGNIER My lord methinks is very long in talk
ALENCON Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock
REIGNIER Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean
ALENCON He may mean more than we poor men do know
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues
REIGNIER My lord where are you What devise you on
PUCELLE Why no I say distrustful recreants
Fight till the last gasp I will be your guard
Since I have entered into these wars
Glory is like a circle in the water
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought
Dispersed are the glories it included
Now am I like that proud insulting ship
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once
CHARLES Was Mahomet inspired with a dove
Thou with an eagle art inspired then
Helen the mother of great Constantine
How may I reverently worship thee enough
ALENCON Leave off delays and let us raise the siege
REIGNIER Woman do what thou canst to save our honours
No prophet will I trust if she prove false           Exeunt
SCENE 3
London Before the Tower gates
in blue coats
GLOUCESTER I am come to survey the Tower this day
Where be these warders that they wait not here
imperiously
let in
Protector
answer him
GLOUCESTER Who willed you or whose will stands but
mine
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms
have we here
GLOUCESTER Lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear
not open
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids
From him I have express commandment
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in
Arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate
Thou art no friend to God or to the King
Enter to the PROTECTOR at the Tower gates WINCHESTER
and his men in tawny coats
WINCHESTER How now ambitious Humphry What means
this
shut out
WINCHESTER I do thou most usurping proditor
And not Protector of the King or realm
GLOUCESTER Stand back thou manifest conspirator
If thou proceed in this thy insolence
WINCHESTER Nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot
This be Damascus be thou cursed Cain
To slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt
Draw men for all this privileged place
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly
In spite of Pope or dignities of church
WINCHESTER Gloucester thou wilt answer this before the
Pope
Now beat them hence why do you let them stay
men and enter in the hurly burly the MAYOR OF
LONDON and his OFFICERS
MAYOR Fie lords that you being supreme magistrates
Thus contumeliously should break the peace
One that still motions war and never peace
That seeks to overthrow religion
Because he is Protector of the realm
And would have armour here out of the Tower
To crown himself King and suppress the Prince
GLOUCESTER I Will not answer thee with words but blows
MAYOR Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife
But to make open proclamation
Cry
use any sword weapon or dagger henceforward upon
pain of death
But we shall meet and break our minds at large
GLOUCESTER Mayor farewell thou dost but what thou
mayst
WINCHESTER Abominable Gloucester guard thy head
For I intend to have it ere long
Exeunt severally GLOUCESTER and WINCHESTER
with their servants
Good God these nobles should such stomachs bear
I myself fight not once in forty year                Exeunt
SCENE 4
France Before Orleans
OF ORLEANS and his BOY
And how the English have the suburbs won
BOY Father I know and oft have shot at them
by me
Something I must do to procure me grace
Wont through a secret grate of iron bars
In yonder tower to overpeer the city
And thence discover how with most advantage
They may vex us with shot or with assault
To intercept this inconvenience
If I could see them Now do thou watch
For I can stay no longer
BOY Father I warrant you take you no care
Enter SALISBURY and TALBOT on the turrets with
SIR WILLIAM GLANSDALE SIR THOMAS GARGRAVE
and others
How wert thou handled being prisoner
TALBOT The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner
But with a baser man of arms by far
But O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart
Whom with my bare fists I would execute
If I now had him brought into my power
TALBOT With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts
To be a public spectacle to all
Here said they is the terror of the French
The scarecrow that affrights our children so
Then broke I from the officers that led me
To hurl at the beholders of my shame
My grisly countenance made others fly
None durst come near for fear of sudden death
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
And if I did but stir out of my bed
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart
Enter the BOY with a linstock
Here through this grate I count each one
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify
Let us look in the sight will much delight thee
Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale
Let me have your express opinions
GARGRAVE I think at the North Gate for there stand lords
GLANSDALE And I here at the bulwark of the bridge
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled
SALISBURY O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners
GARGRAVE O Lord have mercy on me woeful man
Speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak
Accursed tower accursed fatal hand
Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up
One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world
Heaven be thou gracious to none alive
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands
Bear hence his body I will help to bury it
Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life
Speak unto Talbot nay look up to him
Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort
Thou shalt not die whiles
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me
Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero
Play on the lute beholding the towns burn
Wretched shall France be only in my name
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise
Enter a MESSENGER
head
A holy prophetess new risen up
Is come with a great power to raise the siege
TALBOT Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan
Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains
Convey me Salisbury into his tent
Alarum Exeunt
SCENE 5
Before Orleans
Here an alarum again and TALBOT pursueth the
DAUPHIN and driveth him Then enter JOAN LA PUCELLE
driving Englishmen before her Then enter TALBOT
TALBOT Where is my strength my valour and my force
Our English troops retire I cannot stay them
A woman clad in armour chaseth them
Enter LA PUCELLE
TALBOT Heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder
But I will chastise this high minded strumpet
PUCELLE Talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come
I must go victual Orleans forthwith
Go go cheer up thy hungry starved men
Help Salisbury to make his testament
This day is ours as many more shall be                Exit
I know not where I am nor what I do
A witch by fear not force like Hannibal
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
Are from their hives and houses driven away
Now like to whelps we crying run away
Hark countrymen Either renew the fight
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf
Or horse or oxen from the leopard
As you fly from your oft subdued slaves
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge
In spite of us or aught that we could do
O would I were to die with Salisbury
The shame hereof will make me hide my head
Exit TALBOT Alarum retreat
SCENE 6
ORLEANS
Flourish Enter on the walls LA PUCELLE CHARLES
REIGNIER ALENCON and soldiers
PUCELLE Advance our waving colours on the walls
How shall I honour thee for this success
France triumph in thy glorious prophetess
REIGNIER Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the
town
Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires
And feast and banquet in the open streets
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us
ALENCON All France will be replete with mirth and joy
For which I will divide my crown with her
And all the priests and friars in my realm
Shall in procession sing her endless praise
In memory of her when she is dead
Her ashes in an urn more precious
Transported shall be at high festivals
Before the kings and queens of France
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry
Come in and let us banquet royally
After this golden day of victory Flourish           Exeunt

ACT II SCENE 1
Before Orleans
Enter a FRENCH SERGEANT and two SENTINELS
SERGEANT Sirs take your places and be vigilant
If any noise or soldier you perceive
Near to the walls by some apparent sign
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard
Thus are poor servitors
When others sleep upon their quiet beds
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY and forces
march
TALBOT Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy
By whose approach the regions of Artois
Wallon and Picardy are friends to us
This happy night the Frenchmen are secure
Embrace we then this opportunity
As fitting best to quittance their deceit
BEDFORD Coward of France how much he wrongs his fame
To join with witches and the help of hell
BURGUNDY Traitors have never other company
TALBOT A maid they say
BEDFORD A maid and be so martial
BURGUNDY Pray God she prove not masculine ere long
If underneath the standard of the French
She carry armour as she hath begun
TALBOT Well let them practise and converse with spirits
God is our fortress in whose conquering name
Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks
BEDFORD Ascend brave Talbot we will follow thee
TALBOT Not all together better far I guess
That we do make our entrance several ways
That if it chance the one of us do fail
The other yet may rise against their force
BURGUNDY And I to this
TALBOT And here will Talbot mount or make his grave
Now Salisbury for thee and for the right
Of English Henry shall this night appear
How much in duty I am bound to both
SENTINEL Arm arm The enemy doth make assault
Enter several ways BASTARD ALENCON REIGNIER
half ready and half unready
ALENCON How now my lords What all unready so
Hearing alarums at our chamber doors
More venturous or desperate than this
BASTARD I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell
REIGNIER If not of hell the heavens sure favour him
ALENCON Here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped
Enter CHARLES and LA PUCELLE
BASTARD Tut holy Joan was his defensive guard
CHARLES Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame
Didst thou at first to flatter us withal
Make us partakers of a little gain
That now our loss might be ten times so much
PUCELLE Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend
At all times will you have my power alike
Sleeping or waking must I still prevail
Or will you blame and lay the fault on me
Improvident soldiers Had your watch been good
CHARLES Duke of Alencon this was your default
Did look no better to that weighty charge
ALENCON Had all your quarters been as safely kept
As that whereof I had the government
BASTARD Mine was secure
REIGNIER And so was mine my lord
CHARLES And for myself most part of all this night
Within her quarter and mine own precinct
About relieving of the sentinels
Then how or which way should they first break in
PUCELLE Question my lords no further of the case
But weakly guarded where the breach was made
And now there rests no other shift but this
And lay new platforms to endamage them
Alarum Enter an ENGLISH SOLDIER crying
clothes behind
The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword
For I have loaden me with many spoils
Using no other weapon but his name                     Exit
SCENE 2
ORLEANS Within the town
Enter TALBOT BEDFORD BURGUNDY a CAPTAIN
and others
BEDFORD The day begins to break and night is fled
Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit
TALBOT Bring forth the body of old Salisbury
The middle centre of this cursed town
Now have I paid my vow unto his soul
For every drop of blood was drawn from him
And that hereafter ages may behold
What ruin happened in revenge of him
Upon the which that every one may read
The treacherous manner of his mournful death
And what a terror he had been to France
But lords in all our bloody massacre
Nor any of his false confederates
They did amongst the troops of armed men
BURGUNDY Myself as far as I could well discern
For smoke and dusky vapours of the night
When arm in arm they both came swiftly running
That could not live asunder day or night
After that things are set in order here
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER All hail my lords Which of this princely train
Call ye the warlike Talbot for his acts
So much applauded through the realm of France
TALBOT Here is the Talbot who would speak with him
MESSENGER The virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne
With modesty admiring thy renown
By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe
To visit her poor castle where she lies
That she may boast she hath beheld the man
Whose glory fills the world with loud report
BURGUNDY Is it even so Nay then I see our wars
Will turn into a peaceful comic sport
You may not my lord despise her gentle suit
Could not prevail with all their oratory
And therefore tell her I return great thanks
And in submission will attend on her
Will not your honours bear me company
And I have heard it said unbidden guests
Are often welcomest when they are gone
CAPTAIN I do my lord and mean accordingly           Exeunt
SCENE 3
AUVERGNE The Castle
Enter the COUNTESS and her PORTER
COUNTESS Porter remember what I gave in charge
And when you have done so bring the keys to me
PORTER Madam I will
COUNTESS The plot is laid if all things fall out right
I shall as famous be by this exploit
Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight
And his achievements of no less account
Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
To give their censure of these rare reports
Enter MESSENGER and TALBOT
COUNTESS And he is welcome What is this the man
MESSENGER Madam it is
COUNTESS Is this the scourge of France
That with his name the mothers still their babes
I see report is fabulous and false
I thought I should have seen some Hercules
A second Hector for his grim aspect
Alas this is a child a silly dwarf
It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
Should strike such terror to his enemies
TALBOT Madam I have been bold to trouble you
But since your ladyship is not at leisure
COUNTESS What means he now Go ask him whither he
goes
MESSENGER Stay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves
To know the cause of your abrupt departure
COUNTESS If thou be he then art thou prisoner
TALBOT Prisoner To whom
Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me
For in my gallery thy picture hangs
But now the substance shall endure the like
And I will chain these legs and arms of thine
That hast by tyranny these many years
Wasted our country slain our citizens
And sent our sons and husbands captivate
TALBOT Ha ha ha
COUNTESS Laughest thou wretch Thy mirth shall turn to
moan
TALBOT I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
Whereon to practise your severity
COUNTESS Why art not thou the man
TALBOT I am indeed
COUNTESS Then have I substance too
TALBOT No no I am but shadow of myself
For what you see is but the smallest part
And least proportion of humanity
I tell you madam were the whole frame here
It is of such a spacious lofty pitch
COUNTESS This is a riddling merchant for the nonce
He will be here and yet he is not here
How can these contrarieties agree
TALBOT That will I show you presently
Winds his horn drums strike up
a peal of ordnance Enter soldiers
How say you madam Are you now persuaded
That Talbot is but shadow of himself
These are his substance sinews arms and strength
With which he yoketh your rebellious necks
Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
And in a moment makes them desolate
COUNTESS Victorious Talbot pardon my abuse
I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
And more than may be gathered by thy shape
Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
For I am sorry that with reverence
I did not entertain thee as thou art
The mind of Talbot as you did mistake
The outward composition of his body
What you have done hath not offended me
Nor other satisfaction do I crave
But only with your patience that we may
Taste of your wine and see what cates you have
COUNTESS With all my heart and think me honoured
To feast so great a warrior in my house              Exeunt
SCENE 4
London The Temple garden
Enter the EARLS OF SOMERSET SUFFOLK and WARWICK
RICHARD PLANTAGENET VERNON and another LAWYER
PLANTAGENET Great lords and gentlemen what means this
silence
Dare no man answer in a case of truth
SUFFOLK Within the Temple Hall we were too loud
The garden here is more convenient
SUFFOLK Faith I have been a truant in the law
And never yet could frame my will to it
And therefore frame the law unto my will
SOMERSET Judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us
WARWICK Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch
Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth
Between two blades which bears the better temper
Between two horses which doth bear him best
Between two girls which hath the merriest eye
I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment
But in these nice sharp quillets of the law
Good faith I am no wiser than a daw
PLANTAGENET Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance
The truth appears so naked on my side
That any purblind eye may find it out
So clear so shining and so evident
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts
And stands upon the honour of his birth
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me
SOMERSET Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer
But dare maintain the party of the truth
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me
WARWICK I love no colours and without all colour
Of base insinuating flattery
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet
SUFFOLK I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
And say withal I think he held the right
VERNON Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more
Till you conclude that he upon whose side
Shall yield the other in the right opinion
SOMERSET Good Master Vernon it is well objected
If I have fewest I subscribe in silence
PLANTAGENET And I
VERNON Then for the truth and plainness of the case
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here
Giving my verdict on the white rose side
SOMERSET Prick not your finger as you pluck it off
Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
And fall on my side so against your will
VERNON If I my lord for my opinion bleed
Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
And keep me on the side where still I am
SOMERSET Well well come on who else
false
The argument you held was wrong in you
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too
PLANTAGENET Now Somerset where is your argument
SOMERSET Here in my scabbard meditating that
Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red
PLANTAGENET Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our
roses
For pale they look with fear as witnessing
The truth on our side
SOMERSET No Plantagenet
Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses
And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error
PLANTAGENET Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset
SOMERSET Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet
PLANTAGENET Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth
Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood
That shall maintain what I have said is true
Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen
PLANTAGENET Now by this maiden blossom in my hand
I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy
SUFFOLK Turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet
PLANTAGENET Proud Pole I will and scorn both him and
thee
SOMERSET Away away good William de la Pole
We grace the yeoman by conversing with him
His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence
Third son to the third Edward King of England
Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root
Or durst not for his craven heart say thus
On any plot of ground in Christendom
Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge
Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry
His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood
PLANTAGENET My father was attached not attainted
Were growing time once ripened to my will
For your partaker Pole and you yourself
To scourge you for this apprehension
SOMERSET Ay thou shalt find us ready for thee still
And know us by these colours for thy foes
For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear
PLANTAGENET And by my soul this pale and angry rose
Will I for ever and my faction wear
Until it wither with me to my grave
Or flourish to the height of my degree
And so farewell until I meet thee next                 Exit
SOMERSET Have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious
Richard                                                Exit
WARWICK This blot that they object against your house
And if thou be not then created York
I will not live to be accounted Warwick
Meantime in signal of my love to thee
Against proud Somerset and William Pole
Will I upon thy party wear this rose
Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden
Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
A thousand souls to death and deadly night
PLANTAGENET Good Master Vernon I am bound to you
That you on my behalf would pluck a flower
VERNON In your behalf still will I wear the same
LAWYER And so will I
PLANTAGENET Thanks gentle sir
Come let us four to dinner I dare say
This quarrel will drink blood another day            Exeunt
SCENE 5
The Tower of London
Enter MORTIMER brought in a chair and GAOLERS
MORTIMER Kind keepers of my weak decaying age
Let dying Mortimer here rest himself
Even like a man new haled from the rack
So fare my limbs with long imprisonment
And these grey locks the pursuivants of death
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer
These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent
Wax dim as drawing to their exigent
Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief
And pithless arms like to a withered vine
That droops his sapless branches to the ground
Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb
Unable to support this lump of clay
As witting I no other comfort have
But tell me keeper will my nephew come
FIRST KEEPER Richard Plantagenet my lord will come
We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber
MORTIMER Enough my soul shall then be satisfied
Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign
Before whose glory I was great in arms
This loathsome sequestration have I had
But now the arbitrator of despairs
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence
That so he might recover what was lost
Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET
FIRST KEEPER My lord your loving nephew now is come
MORTIMER Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come
Your nephew late despised Richard comes
MORTIMER Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp
O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks
That I may kindly give one fainting kiss
PLANTAGENET First lean thine aged back against mine arm
This day in argument upon a case
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue
Else with the like I had requited him
In honour of a true Plantagenet
And for alliance sake declare the cause
My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head
Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine
Was cursed instrument of his decease
PLANTAGENET Discover more at large what cause that was
For I am ignorant and cannot guess
MORTIMER I will if that my fading breath permit
And death approach not ere my tale be done
Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king
Of Edward king the third of that descent
During whose reign the Percies of the north
Finding his usurpation most unjust
I was the next by birth and parentage
For by my mother I derived am
From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son
To King Edward the Third whereas he
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree
Being but fourth of that heroic line
But mark as in this haughty great attempt
They laboured to plant the rightful heir
I lost my liberty and they their lives
Long after this when Henry the Fifth
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign
From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York
Marrying my sister that thy mother was
Again in pity of my hard distress
Levied an army weening to redeem
But as the rest so fell that noble earl
And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers
PLANTAGENET Of Which my lord your honour is the last
MORTIMER True and thou seest that I no issue have
And that my fainting words do warrant death
Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather
But yet be wary in thy studious care
PLANTAGENET Thy grave admonishments prevail with me
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny
MORTIMER With silence nephew be thou politic
Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster
But now thy uncle is removing hence
With long continuance in a settled place
PLANTAGENET O uncle would some part of my young years
Might but redeem the passage of your age
MORTIMER Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer
doth
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill
Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good
Only give order for my funeral
And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes
PLANTAGENET And peace no war befall thy parting soul
In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
Well I will lock his counsel in my breast
And what I do imagine let that rest
Keepers convey him hence and I myself
Will see his burial better than his life
Exeunt GAOLERS hearing out the body of MORTIMER
Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer
And for those wrongs those bitter injuries
I doubt not but with honour to redress
And therefore haste I to the Parliament
Either to be restored to my blood

ACT III SCENE 1
London The Parliament House
Flourish Enter the KING EXETER GLOUCESTER WARWICK SOMERSET and SUFFOLK
the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER RICHARD PLANTAGENET and others
GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill WINCHESTER snatches it and tears it
Humphrey of Gloucester if thou canst accuse
Do it without invention suddenly
I with sudden and extemporal speech
Purpose to answer what thou canst object
GLOUCESTER Presumptuous priest this place commands my
patience
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen
No prelate such is thy audacious wickedness
Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks
As very infants prattle of thy pride
Thou art a most pernicious usurer
Froward by nature enemy to peace
Lascivious wanton more than well beseems
A man of thy profession and degree
As well at London Bridge as at the Tower
Beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted
The King thy sovereign is not quite exempt
From envious malice of thy swelling heart
WINCHESTER Gloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe
To give me hearing what I shall reply
If I were covetous ambitious or perverse
As he will have me how am I so poor
Or how haps it I seek not to advance
Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling
And for dissension who preferreth peace
No my good lords it is not that offends
It is because no one should sway but he
No one but he should be about the King
And that engenders thunder in his breast
And makes him roar these accusations forth
But he shall know I am as good
GLOUCESTER As good
Thou bastard of my grandfather
WINCHESTER Ay lordly sir for what are you I pray
GLOUCESTER Am I not Protector saucy priest
WINCHESTER And am not I a prelate of the church
GLOUCESTER Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps
And useth it to patronage his theft
WINCHESTER Unreverent Gloucester
GLOUCESTER Thou art reverend
Touching thy spiritual function not thy life
WINCHESTER Rome shall remedy this
WARWICK Roam thither then
SOMERSET My lord it were your duty to forbear
WARWICK Ay see the bishop be not overborne
SOMERSET Methinks my lord should be religious
And know the office that belongs to such
WARWICK Methinks his lordship should be humbler
It fitteth not a prelate so to plead
Is not his Grace Protector to the King
tongue
Else would I have a fling at Winchester
KING HENRY Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester
The special watchmen of our English weal
I would prevail if prayers might prevail
To join your hearts in love and amity
O what a scandal is it to our crown
That two such noble peers as ye should jar
Believe me lords my tender years can tell
Civil dissension is a viperous worm
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth
WARWICK An uproar I dare warrant
Enter the MAYOR OF LONDON attended
MAYOR O my good lords and virtuous Henry
Pity the city of London pity us
Forbidden late to carry any weapon
And banding themselves in contrary parts
Our windows are broke down in every street
Enter in skirmish the retainers of GLOUCESTER and
WINCHESTER with bloody pates
KING HENRY We charge you on allegiance to ourself
Pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife
fall to it with our teeth
GLOUCESTER You of my household leave this peevish broil
Just and upright and for your royal birth
Inferior to none but to his Majesty
And ere that we will suffer such a prince
So kind a father of the commonweal
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate
We and our wives and children all will fight
GLOUCESTER Stay stay I say
And if you love me as you say you do
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile
KING HENRY O how this discord doth afflict my soul
Can you my Lord of Winchester behold
My sighs and tears and will not once relent
Who should be pitiful if you be not
Or who should study to prefer a peace
If holy churchmen take delight in broils
WARWICK Yield my Lord Protector yield Winchester
Except you mean with obstinate repulse
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm
You see what mischief and what murder too
Hath been enacted through your enmity
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood
WINCHESTER He shall submit or I will never yield
GLOUCESTER Compassion on the King commands me stoop
Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
Should ever get that privilege of me
WARWICK Behold my Lord of Winchester the Duke
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear
Why look you still so stem and tragical
GLOUCESTER Here Winchester I offer thee my hand
KING HENRY Fie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach
That malice was a great and grievous sin
And will not you maintain the thing you teach
But prove a chief offender in the same
WARWICK Sweet King The Bishop hath a kindly gird
For shame my Lord of Winchester relent
What shall a child instruct you what to do
WINCHESTER Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give
heart
See here my friends and loving countrymen
This token serveth for a flag of truce
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers
So help me God as I dissemble not
KING HENRY O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester
How joyful am I made by this contract
Away my masters trouble us no more
But join in friendship as your lords have done
affords                         Exeunt servants MAYOR &C
WARWICK Accept this scroll most gracious sovereign
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
We do exhibit to your Majesty
prince
An if your Grace mark every circumstance
You have great reason to do Richard right
Especially for those occasions
At Eltham Place I told your Majesty
KING HENRY And those occasions uncle were of force
Therefore my loving lords our pleasure is
That Richard be restored to his blood
WARWICK Let Richard be restored to his blood
WINCHESTER As will the rest so willeth Winchester
KING HENRY If Richard will be true not that alone
But all the whole inheritance I give
That doth belong unto the house of York
From whence you spring by lineal descent
PLANTAGENET Thy humble servant vows obedience
And humble service till the point of death
KING HENRY Stoop then and set your knee against my foot
And in reguerdon of that duty done
I girt thee with the valiant sword of York
Rise Richard like a true Plantagenet
And rise created princely Duke of York
PLANTAGENET And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall
And as my duty springs so perish they
That grudge one thought against your Majesty
ALL Welcome high Prince the mighty Duke of York
York
GLOUCESTER Now will it best avail your Majesty
The presence of a king engenders love
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends
As it disanimates his enemies
KING HENRY When Gloucester says the word King Henry
goes
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes
GLOUCESTER Your ships already are in readiness
Sennet Flourish Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER Ay we may march in England or in France
Not seeing what is likely to ensue
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
And will at last break out into a flame
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away
So will this base and envious discord breed
And now I fear that fatal prophecy
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
And Henry born at Windsor should lose all
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
His days may finish ere that hapless time              Exit
SCENE 2
France Before Rouen
like countrymen with sacks upon their backs
PUCELLE These are the city gates the gates of Rouen
Through which our policy must make a breach
Take heed be wary how you place your words
That come to gather money for their corn
If we have entrance as I hope we shall
And that we find the slothful watch but weak
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them
FIRST SOLDIER Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen
PUCELLE Paysans pauvres gens de France

Enter CHARLES BASTARD ALENCON REIGNIER and forces
CHARLES Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem
Now she is there how will she specify
Here is the best and safest passage in
ALENCON By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower
Enter LA PUCELLE on the top thrusting out
a torch burning
PUCELLE Behold this is the happy wedding torch
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen
But burning fatal to the Talbotites                    Exit
BASTARD See noble Charles the beacon of our friend
The burning torch in yonder turret stands
CHARLES Now shine it like a comet of revenge
A prophet to the fall of all our foes
ALENCON Defer no time delays have dangerous ends
And then do execution on the watch Alarum           Exeunt
An alarum Enter TALBOT in an excursion
TALBOT France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears
If Talbot but survive thy treachery
PUCELLE that witch that damned sorceress
Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares
An alarum excursions BEDFORD brought in sick in
a chair Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without
within LA PUCELLE CHARLES BASTARD ALENCON
and REIGNIER on the walls
PUCELLE Good morrow gallants Want ye corn for bread
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
BURGUNDY Scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan
I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn
CHARLES Your Grace may starve perhaps before that time
BEDFORD O let no words but deeds revenge this treason
PUCELLE What you do good grey beard Break a
lance
And run a tilt at death within a chair
TALBOT Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
And twit with cowardice a man half dead
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame
PUCELLE Are ye so hot sir Yet Pucelle hold thy peace
If Talbot do but thunder rain will follow
God speed the parliament Who shall be the Speaker
TALBOT Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field
PUCELLE Belike your lordship takes us then for fools
To try if that our own be ours or no
TALBOT I speak not to that railing Hecate
But unto thee Alencon and the rest
Will ye like soldiers come and fight it out
ALENCON Signior no
TALBOT Signior hang Base muleteers of France
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen
For Talbot means no goodness by his looks
That we are here                      Exeunt from the walls
TALBOT And there will we be too ere it be long
Vow Burgundy by honour of thy house
Either to get the town again or die
And I as sure as English Henry lives
And as his father here was conqueror
As sure as in this late betrayed town
So sure I swear to get the town or die
BURGUNDY My vows are equal partners with thy vows
TALBOT But ere we go regard this dying prince
The valiant Duke of Bedford Come my lord
We will bestow you in some better place
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age
BEDFORD Lord Talbot do not so dishonour me
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
And will be partner of your weal or woe
BURGUNDY Courageous Bedford let us now persuade you
BEDFORD Not to be gone from hence for once I read
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
Came to the field and vanquished his foes
Because I ever found them as myself
TALBOT Undaunted spirit in a dying breast
Then be it so Heavens keep old Bedford safe
And now no more ado brave Burgundy
But gather we our forces out of hand
And set upon our boasting enemy
Exeunt against the town all but BEDFORD and attendants
An alarum excursions Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE
and a CAPTAIN
CAPTAIN Whither away Sir John Fastolfe in such haste
FASTOLFE Whither away To save myself by flight
We are like to have the overthrow again
CAPTAIN What Will you and leave Lord Talbot
FASTOLFE Ay
All the Talbots in the world to save my life          Exit
CAPTAIN Cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee
Exit into the town
Retreat excursions LA PUCELLE ALENCON
and CHARLES fly
BEDFORD Now quiet soul depart when heaven please
What is the trust or strength of foolish man
They that of late were daring with their scoffs
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves
TALBOT Lost and recovered in a day again
This is a double honour Burgundy
Yet heavens have glory for this victory
BURGUNDY Warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
TALBOT Thanks gentle Duke But where is Pucelle now
I think her old familiar is asleep
What all amort Rouen hangs her head for grief
That such a valiant company are fled
Now will we take some order in the town
Placing therein some expert officers
And then depart to Paris to the King
For there young Henry with his nobles lie
BURGUNDY What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy
A braver soldier never couched lance
A gentler heart did never sway in court
But kings and mightiest potentates must die
SCENE 3
The plains near Rouen
Enter CHARLES the BASTARD ALENCON LA PUCELLE
and forces
PUCELLE Dismay not Princes at this accident
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered
Care is no cure but rather corrosive
For things that are not to be remedied
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
And like a peacock sweep along his tail
CHARLES We have guided by thee hitherto
And of thy cunning had no diffidence
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust
BASTARD Search out thy wit for secret policies
And we will make thee famous through the world
Employ thee then sweet virgin for our good
PUCELLE Then thus it must be this doth Joan devise
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
To leave the Talbot and to follow us
CHARLES Ay marry sweeting if we could do that
Nor should that nation boast it so with us
But be extirped from our provinces
And not have tide of an earldom here
PUCELLE Your honours shall perceive how I will work
To bring this matter to the wished end
Hark by the sound of drum you may perceive
Here sound an English march Enter and pass over
at a distance TALBOT and his forces
There goes the Talbot with his colours spread
And all the troops of English after him
French march Enter the DUKE OF BURGUNDY and
his forces
Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind
Summon a parley we will talk with him
CHARLES A parley with the Duke of Burgundy
BURGUNDY Who craves a parley with the Burgundy
PUCELLE The princely Charles of France thy countryman
hence
CHARLES Speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words
PUCELLE Brave Burgundy undoubted hope of France
Stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee
PUCELLE Look on thy country look on fertile France
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe
As looks the mother on her lowly babe
When death doth close his tender dying eyes
See see the pining malady of France
Behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds
Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast
O turn thy edged sword another way
Strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears
Or nature makes me suddenly relent
PUCELLE Besides all French and France exclaims on thee
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny
When Talbot hath set footing once in France
Who then but English Henry will be lord
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe
And was he not in England prisoner
But when they heard he was thine enemy
They set him free without his ransom paid
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends
Come come return return thou wandering lord
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms
BURGUNDY I am vanquished these haughty words of hers
And made me almost yield upon my knees
Forgive me country and sweet countrymen
And lords accept this hearty kind embrace
My forces and my power of men are yours
again
CHARLES Welcome brave Duke Thy friendship makes us
fresh
BASTARD And doth beget new courage in our breasts
And doth deserve a coronet of gold
CHARLES Now let us on my lords and join our powers
And seek how we may prejudice the foe                Exeunt

Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem
And with submissive loyalty of heart
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
KING HENRY Is this the Lord Talbot uncle Gloucester
That hath so long been resident in France
GLOUCESTER Yes if it please your Majesty my liege
KING HENRY Welcome brave captain and victorious lord
When I was young as yet I am not old
I do remember how my father said
A stouter champion never handled sword
Long since we were resolved of your truth
Your faithful service and your toil in war
Yet never have you tasted our reward
Because till now we never saw your face
Therefore stand up and for these good deserts
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury

ACT IV SCENE 1
Park The palace
Enter the KING GLOUCESTER WINCHESTER YORK SUFFOLK SOMERSET WARWICK
TALBOT EXETER the GOVERNOR OF PARIS and others
GLOUCESTER Lord Bishop set the crown upon his head
WINCHESTER God save King Henry of that name the Sixth
GLOUCESTER Now Governor of Paris take your oath
That you elect no other king but him
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends
And none your foes but such as shall pretend
Malicious practices against his state
This shall ye do so help you righteous God
Exeunt GOVERNOR and his train
Enter SIR JOHN FASTOLFE
FASTOLFE My gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais
To haste unto your coronation
TALBOT Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee
Which I have done because unworthily
Thou wast installed in that high degree
Pardon me princely Henry and the rest
This dastard at the battle of Patay
When but in all I was six thousand strong
And that the French were almost ten to one
Before we met or that a stroke was given
Like to a trusty squire did run away
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men
Myself and divers gentlemen beside
Then judge great lords if I have done amiss
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
GLOUCESTER To say the truth this fact was infamous
And ill beseeming any common man
Much more a knight a captain and a leader
Knights of the Garter were of noble birth
Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage
Such as were grown to credit by the wars
Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress
But always resolute in most extremes
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight
Profaning this most honourable order
And should if I were worthy to be judge
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood
doom
Be packing therefore thou that wast a knight
Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death
Exit FASTOLFE
And now my Lord Protector view the letter
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign
Or doth this churlish superscription
Together with the pitiful complaints
Of such as your oppression feeds upon
Forsaken your pernicious faction
O monstrous treachery Can this be so
That in alliance amity and oaths
There should be found such false dissembling guile
KING HENRY What Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt
GLOUCESTER He doth my lord and is become your foe
KING HENRY Is that the worst this letter doth contain
GLOUCESTER It is the worst and all my lord he writes
KING HENRY Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with
And give him chastisement for this abuse
How say you my lord are you not content
TALBOT Content my liege Yes but that I am prevented
KING HENRY Then gather strength and march unto him
straight
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
And what offence it is to flout his friends
TALBOT I go my lord in heart desiring still
You may behold confusion of your foes                  Exit
Enter VERNON and BASSET
VERNON Grant me the combat gracious sovereign
BASSET And me my lord grant me the combat too
YORK This is my servant hear him noble Prince
SOMERSET And this is mine sweet Henry favour him
KING HENRY Be patient lords and give them leave to speak
Say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim
And wherefore crave you combat or with whom
VERNON With him my lord for he hath done me wrong
BASSET And I with him for he hath done me wrong
KING HENRY What is that wrong whereof you both
BASSET Crossing the sea from England into France
This fellow here with envious carping tongue
Upbraided me about the rose I wear
Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
About a certain question in the law
With other vile and ignominious terms
In confutation of which rude reproach
I crave the benefit of law of arms
VERNON And that is my petition noble lord
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
To set a gloss upon his bold intent
And he first took exceptions at this badge
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
YORK Will not this malice Somerset be left
SOMERSET Your private grudge my Lord of York will out
KING HENRY Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick
men When for so slight and frivolous a cause
Such factious emulations shall arise
Good cousins both of York and Somerset
Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace
YORK Let this dissension first be tried by fight
And then your Highness shall command a peace
SOMERSET The quarrel toucheth none but us alone
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then
YORK There is my pledge accept it Somerset
VERNON Nay let it rest where it began at first
BASSET Confirm it so mine honourable lord
GLOUCESTER Confirm it so Confounded be your strife
And perish ye with your audacious prate
With this immodest clamorous outrage
To trouble and disturb the King and us
To bear with their perverse objections
Much less to take occasion from their mouths
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves
Let me persuade you take a better course
EXETER It grieves his Highness Good my lords be friends
KING HENRY Come hither you that would be combatants
Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause
And you my lords remember where we are
In France amongst a fickle wavering nation
If they perceive dissension in our looks
And that within ourselves we disagree
To wilful disobedience and rebel
Beside what infamy will there arise
When foreign princes shall be certified
That for a toy a thing of no regard
O think upon the conquest of my father
My tender years and let us not forgo
That for a trifle that was bought with blood
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife
I see no reason if I wear this rose
That any one should therefore be suspicious
I more incline to Somerset than York
Both are my kinsmen and I love them both
As well they may upbraid me with my crown
But your discretions better can persuade
Than I am able to instruct or teach
And therefore as we hither came in peace
So let us still continue peace and love
Cousin of York we institute your Grace
To be our Regent in these parts of France
And good my Lord of Somerset unite
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot
And like true subjects sons of your progenitors
Go cheerfully together and digest
Your angry choler on your enemies
Ourself my Lord Protector and the rest
After some respite will return to Calais
From thence to England where I hope ere long
To be presented by your victories
With Charles Alencon and that traitorous rout
Flourish Exeunt all but YORK WARWICK
EXETER VERNON
WARWICK My Lord of York I promise you the King
Prettily methought did play the orator
YORK And so he did but yet I like it not
In that he wears the badge of Somerset
WARWICK Tush that was but his fancy blame him not
I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm
Other affairs must now be managed
Exeunt all but EXETER
EXETER Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice
For had the passions of thy heart burst out
More rancorous spite more furious raging broils
This jarring discord of nobility
This shouldering of each other in the court
This factious bandying of their favourites
But that it doth presage some ill event
But more when envy breeds unkind division
There comes the ruin there begins confusion           Exit
SCENE 2
France Before Bordeaux
Enter TALBOT with trump and drum
TALBOT Go to the gates of Bordeaux trumpeter
Summon their general unto the wall
Trumpet sounds a parley Enter aloft the
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH and others
English John Talbot Captains calls you forth
Servant in arms to Harry King of England
And thus he would open your city gates
Be humble to us call my sovereignvours
And do him homage as obedient subjects
You tempt the fury of my three attendants
Lean famine quartering steel and climbing fire
Who in a moment even with the earth
Shall lay your stately and air braving towers
If you forsake the offer of their love
GENERAL OF THE FRENCH Thou ominous and fearful owl of
death
The period of thy tyranny approacheth
On us thou canst not enter but by death
For I protest we are well fortified
And strong enough to issue out and fight
If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee
To wall thee from the liberty of flight
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
And pale destruction meets thee in the face
To rive their dangerous artillery
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot
This is the latest glory of thy praise
That I thy enemy due thee withal
For ere the glass that now begins to run
Finish the process of his sandy hour
These eyes that see thee now well coloured
Shall see thee withered bloody pale and dead
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out             Exit
TALBOT He fables not I hear the enemy
Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings
O negligent and heedless discipline
If we be English deer be then in blood
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay
Sell every man his life as dear as mine
And they shall find dear deer of us my friends
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight          Exeunt
SCENE 3
Plains in Gascony
Enter YORK with trumpet and many soldiers A
MESSENGER meets him
By your espials were discovered
Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led
Bordeaux
YORK A plague upon that villain Somerset
That thus delays my promised supply
Of horsemen that were levied for this siege
Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid
And I am louted by a traitor villain
And cannot help the noble chevalier
God comfort him in this necessity
If he miscarry farewell wars in France
Enter SIR WILLIAM LUCY
LUCY Thou princely leader of our English strength
Never so needful on the earth of France
Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot
Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
To Bordeaux warlike Duke to Bordeaux York
YORK O God that Somerset who in proud heart
So should we save a valiant gentleman
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep
That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep
YORK He dies we lose I break my warlike word
All long of this vile traitor Somerset
And on his son young John who two hours since
I met in travel toward his warlike father
This seven years did not Talbot see his son
And now they meet where both their lives are done
YORK Alas what joy shall noble Talbot have
To bid his young son welcome to his grave
Away vexation almost stops my breath
Lucy farewell no more my fortune can
But curse the cause I cannot aid the man
Maine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won away
Long all of Somerset and his delay         Exit with forces
LUCY Thus while the vulture of sedition
Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders
Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror
Henry the Fifth Whiles they each other cross
Lives honours lands and all hurry to loss          Exit
SCENE 4
Other plains of Gascony
Enter SOMERSET With his forces an OFFICER of
SOMERSET It is too late I cannot send them now
This expedition was by York and Talbot
Too rashly plotted all our general force
Might with a sally of the very town
Be buckled with The over daring Talbot
Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
By this unheedful desperate wild adventure
York set him on to fight and die in shame
That Talbot dead great York might bear the name
OFFICER Here is Sir William Lucy who with me
Enter SIR WILLIAM LUCY
SOMERSET How now Sir William Whither were you sent
LUCY Whither my lord From bought and sold Lord
Talbot
Cries out for noble York and Somerset
To beat assailing death from his weak legions
And whiles the honourable captain there
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation
Let not your private discord keep away
The levied succours that should lend him aid
While he renowned noble gentleman
Yield up his life unto a world of odds
Orleans the Bastard Charles Burgundy
Alencon Reignier compass him about
And Talbot perisheth by your default
SOMERSET York set him on York should have sent him aid
LUCY And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims
Swearing that you withhold his levied host
Collected for this expedition
SOMERSET York lies he might have sent and had the horse
I owe him little duty and less love
And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending
LUCY The fraud of England not the force of France
Never to England shall he bear his life
SOMERSET Come go I will dispatch the horsemen straight
Within six hours they will be at his aid
For fly he could not if he would have fled
And fly would Talbot never though he might
SOMERSET If he be dead brave Talbot then adieu
LUCY His fame lives in the world his shame in you       Exeunt
SCENE 5
The English camp near Bordeaux
Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son
TALBOT O young John Talbot I did send for thee
To tutor thee in stratagems of war
When sapless age and weak unable limbs
Should bring thy father to his drooping chair
Now thou art come unto a feast of death
A terrible and unavoided danger
Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse
By sudden flight Come dally not be gone
JOHN Is my name Talbot and am I your son
And shall I fly O if you love my mother
Dishonour not her honourable name
To make a bastard and a slave of me
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood
TALBOT Fly to revenge my death if I be slain
TALBOT If we both stay we both are sure to die
JOHN Then let me stay and father do you fly
Your loss is great so your regard should be
My worth unknown no loss is known in me
Upon my death the French can little boast
In yours they will in you all hopes are lost
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won
But mine it will that no exploit have done
You fled for vantage every one will swear
There is no hope that ever I will stay
If the first hour I shrink and run away
Here on my knee I beg mortality
TALBOT Upon my blessing I command thee go
JOHN To fight I will but not to fly the foe
JOHN No part of him but will be shame in me
TALBOT Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it
JOHN Yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it
JOHN You cannot witness for me being slain
If death be so apparent then both fly
TALBOT And leave my followers here to fight and die
My age was never tainted with such shame
JOHN And shall my youth be guilty of such blame
No more can I be severed from your side
Than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide
Stay go do what you will the like do I
For live I will not if my father die
TALBOT Then here I take my leave of thee fair son
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon
Come side by side together live and die
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly         Exeunt
SCENE 6
A field of battle
about and TALBOT rescues him
TALBOT Saint George and victory Fight soldiers fight
The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word
And left us to the rage of France his sword
Where is John Talbot Pause and take thy breath
JOHN O twice my father twice am I thy son
Till with thy warlike sword despite of fate
fire
Beat down Alencon Orleans Burgundy
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee
The ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood
From thee my boy and had the maidenhood
Of thy first fight I soon encountered
And interchanging blows I quickly shed
Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine
Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine
Here purposing the Bastard to destroy
Art thou not weary John How dost thou fare
Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly
Fly to revenge my death when I am dead
The help of one stands me in little stead
O too much folly is it well I wot
To hazard all our lives in one small boat
By me they nothing gain an if I stay
All these and more we hazard by thy stay
JOHN The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart
On that advantage bought with such a shame
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly
The coward horse that bears me fall and die
And like me to the peasant boys of France
Surely by all the glory you have won
Then talk no more of flight it is no boot
Thou Icarus thy life to me is sweet
SCENE 7
Another part of the field
Alarum excursions Enter old TALBOT led by a SERVANT
TALBOT Where is my other life Mine own is gone
And like a hungry lion did commence
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience
But when my angry guardant stood alone
Suddenly made him from my side to start
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
His overmounting spirit and there died
My Icarus my blossom in his pride
Enter soldiers bearing the body of JOHN TALBOT
SERVANT O my dear lord lo where your son is borne
Anon from thy insulting tyranny
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity
Two Talbots winged through the lither sky
In thy despite shall scape mortality
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath
Brave Death by speaking whether he will or no
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe
Poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say
My spirit can no longer bear these harms
Soldiers adieu I have what I would have
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BURGUNDY BASTARD
LA PUCELLE and forces
CHARLES Had York and Somerset brought rescue in
We should have found a bloody day of this
But with a proud majestical high scorn
So rushing in the bowels of the French
He left me proudly as unworthy fight
BURGUNDY Doubtless he would have made a noble knight
See where he lies inhearsed in the arms
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms
BASTARD Hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder
CHARLES O no forbear For that which we have fled
During the life let us not wrong it dead
Enter SIR WILLIAM Lucy attended a FRENCH
HERALD preceding
CHARLES On what submissive message art thou sent
We English warriors wot not what it means
And to survey the bodies of the dead
Valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury
Created for his rare success in arms
Great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield
Lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Verdun of Alton
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield
The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge
Knight of the noble order of Saint George
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece
Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth
Of all his wars within the realm of France
The Turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath
Writes not so tedious a style as this
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces
O that I could but can these dead to life
It were enough to fright the realm of France
Were but his picture left amongst you here
It would amaze the proudest of you all
Give me their bodies that I may bear them hence
And give them burial as beseems their worth
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit
They would but stink and putrefy the air
CHARLES Go take their bodies hence
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard
CHARLES So we be rid of them do with them what thou
wilt
And now to Paris in this conquering vein

The Emperor and the Earl of Armagnac
GLOUCESTER I have my lord and their intent is this
They humbly sue unto your Excellence
To have a godly peace concluded of
Between the realms of England and of France
KING HENRY How doth your Grace affect their motion
GLOUCESTER Well my good lord and as the only means
To stop effusion of our Christian blood
And stablish quietness on every side
KING HENRY Ay marry uncle for I always thought
It was both impious and unnatural
That such immanity and bloody strife
Should reign among professors of one faith
GLOUCESTER Beside my lord the sooner to effect
And surer bind this knot of amity
The Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles
A man of great authority in France
Proffers his only daughter to your Grace
In marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry
KING HENRY Marriage uncle Alas my years are young
And fitter is my study and my books
Than wanton dalliance with a paramour
So let them have their answers every one
I shall be well content with any choice
BEAUFORT the PAPAL LEGATE and two AMBASSADORS
Then I perceive that will be verified
Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy
KING HENRY My Lords Ambassadors your several suits
Your purpose is both good and reasonable
To draw conditions of a friendly peace
Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
Shall be transported presently to France
GLOUCESTER And for the proffer of my lord your master
Her beauty and the value of her dower

Bear her this jewel pledge of my affection
And so my Lord Protector see them guarded
Commit them to the fortune of the sea
Exeunt all but WINCHESTER and the LEGATE
WINCHESTER Stay my Lord Legate you shall first receive
The sum of money which I promised
Should be delivered to his Holiness
For clothing me in these grave ornaments
trow
Or be inferior to the proudest peer
Humphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive
That neither in birth or for authority
The Bishop will be overborne by thee
Or sack this country with a mutiny                   Exeunt

CHARLES Somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is
But we will presently provide for them
BURGUNDY I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there
Now he is gone my lord you need not fear
Command the conquest Charles it shall be thine
Let Henry fret and all the world repine
CHARLES Then on my lords and France be fortunate
Exeunt
SCENE 3
Before Angiers
Alarum excursions Enter LA PUCELLE
PUCELLE The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly
Now help ye charming spells and periapts
And ye choice spirits that admonish me
You speedy helpers that are substitutes
Under the lordly monarch of the north
Appear and aid me in this enterprise
Enter FIENDS
This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
Out of the powerful regions under earth
Help me this once that France may get the field
Where I was wont to feed you with my blood
In earnest of a further benefit
So you do condescend to help me now
No hope to have redress My body shall
Pay recompense if you will grant my suit
Cannot my body nor blood sacrifice
Entreat you to your wonted furtherance
Before that England give the French the foil
See they forsake me Now the time is come
My ancient incantations are too weak
And hell too strong for me to buckle with
Now France thy glory droopeth to the dust            Exit
Excursions Enter French and English fighting
LA PUCELLE and YORK fight hand to hand LA PUCELLE

As if with Circe she would change my shape
YORK O Charles the Dauphin is a proper man
No shape but his can please your dainty eye
PUCELLE A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and thee
By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds
YORK Fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue

YORK Curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake
Exeunt
Alarum Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand
SUFFOLK Be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner
O fairest beauty do not fear nor fly
For I will touch thee but with reverent hands
I kiss these fingers for eternal peace
And lay them gently on thy tender side
Who art thou Say that I may honour thee
MARGARET Margaret my name and daughter to a king
So doth the swan her downy cygnets save
Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings
Yet if this servile usage once offend
My hand would free her but my heart says no
As plays the sun upon the glassy streams
Twinkling another counterfeited beam
So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes
Fain would I woo her yet I dare not speak
Fie de la Pole disable not thyself
Hast not a tongue Is she not here thy prisoner
Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough
MARGARET Say Earl of Suffolk if thy name be so
What ransom must I pay before I pass
For I perceive I am thy prisoner
suit
Before thou make a trial of her love
pay
She is a woman therefore to be won
wife
Then how can Margaret be thy paramour
MARGARET I were best leave him for he will not hear
card
MARGARET He talks at random sure the man is mad
MARGARET And yet I would that you would answer me
MARGARET He talks of wood It is some carpenter
And peace established between these realms
But there remains a scruple in that too
For though her father be the King of Naples
Duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor
And our nobility will scorn the match
Henry is youthful and will quickly yield
Madam I have a secret to reveal
a knight
And will not any way dishonour me
SUFFOLK Lady vouchsafe to listen what I say
And then I need not crave his courtesy
SUFFOLK Sweet madam give me hearing in a cause
now
SUFFOLK Lady wherefore talk you so
SUFFOLK Say gentle Princess would you not suppose
Your bondage happy to be made a queen
MARGARET To be a queen in bondage is more vile
Than is a slave in base servility
For princes should be free
SUFFOLK And so shall you
MARGARET Why what concerns his freedom unto me
To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
And set a precious crown upon thy head
MARGARET What
SUFFOLK His love
SUFFOLK No gentle madam I unworthy am
To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
And have no portion in the choice myself
How say you madam Are ye so content
MARGARET An if my father please I am content
SUFFOLK Then call our captains and our colours forth
Sound a parley Enter REIGNIER on the walls
See Reignier see thy daughter prisoner
REIGNIER To whom
SUFFOLK To me
REIGNIER Suffolk what remedy
I am a soldier and unapt to weep
SUFFOLK Yes there is remedy enough my lord
Consent and for thy honour give consent
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king
REIGNIER Speaks Suffolk as he thinks
SUFFOLK Fair Margaret knows
That Suffolk doth not flatter face or feign
REIGNIER Upon thy princely warrant I descend
To give thee answer of thy just demand
Exit REIGNIER from the walls
SUFFOLK And here I will expect thy coming
Trumpets sound Enter REIGNIER below
REIGNIER Welcome brave Earl into our territories
Command in Anjou what your Honour pleases
SUFFOLK Thanks Reignier happy for so sweet a child
Fit to be made companion with a king
What answer makes your Grace unto my suit
REIGNIER Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
To be the princely bride of such a lord
Upon condition I may quietly
Enjoy mine own the country Maine and Anjou
Free from oppression or the stroke of war
SUFFOLK That is her ransom I deliver her
And those two counties I will undertake
Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy
As deputy unto that gracious king
Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith
SUFFOLK Reignier of France I give thee kingly thanks
Because this is in traffic of a king
To be mine own attorney in this case
So farewell Reignier Set this diamond safe
In golden palaces as it becomes
REIGNIER I do embrace thee as I would embrace
The Christian prince King Henry were he here
MARGARET Farewell my lord Good wishes praise and
prayers
SUFFOLK Farewell sweet madam But hark you Margaret
No princely commendations to my king
MARGARET Such commendations as becomes a maid
A virgin and his servant say to him
But madam I must trouble you again
No loving token to his Majesty
MARGARET Yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart
Never yet taint with love I send the King
MARGARET That for thyself I will not so presume
To send such peevish tokens to a king
Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET
SUFFOLK O wert thou for myself But Suffolk stay
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount
And natural graces that extinguish art
Repeat their semblance often on the seas
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder         Exit
SCENE 4
Camp of the DUKE OF YORK in Anjou
Enter YORK WARWICK and others
Enter LA PUCELLE guarded and a SHEPHERD
Have I sought every country far and near
And now it is my chance to find thee out
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death
PUCELLE Decrepit miser base ignoble wretch
I am descended of a gentler blood
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine
I did beget her all the parish knows
Her mother liveth yet can testify
WARWICK Graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage
Wicked and vile and so her death concludes
SHEPHERD Fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear
Deny me not I prithee gentle Joan
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth
The morn that I was wedded to her mother
Kneel down and take my blessing good my girl
Wilt thou not stoop Now cursed be the time
Of thy nativity I would the milk
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake
Or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee
Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab
O burn her burn her Hanging is too good             Exit
To fill the world with vicious qualities
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain
But issued from the progeny of kings
Virtuous and holy chosen from above
By inspiration of celestial grace
To work exceeding miracles on earth
I never had to do with wicked spirits
But you that are polluted with your lusts
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices
Because you want the grace that others have
You judge it straight a thing impossible
To compass wonders but by help of devils
No misconceived Joan of Arc hath been
A virgin from her tender infancy
Chaste and immaculate in very thought
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven
YORK Ay ay Away with her to execution
WARWICK And hark ye sirs because she is a maid
Spare for no fagots let there be enow
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake
That so her torture may be shortened
PUCELLE Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts
Then Joan discover thine infirmity
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege
I am with child ye bloody homicides
Murder not then the fruit within my womb
Although ye hale me to a violent death
YORK Now heaven forfend The holy maid with child
Is all your strict preciseness come to this
YORK She and the Dauphin have been juggling
I did imagine what would be her refuge
Especially since Charles must father it
YORK Alencon that notorious Machiavel
It dies an if it had a thousand lives
PUCELLE O give me leave I have deluded you
YORK And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure
Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee
Use no entreaty for it is in vain
curse
May never glorious sun reflex his beams
Upon the country where you make abode
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
Environ you till mischief and despair
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves
Exit guarded
YORK Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes
Thou foul accursed minister of hell
Enter CARDINAL BEAUFORT attended
CARDINAL Lord Regent I do greet your Excellence
With letters of commission from the King
For know my lords the states of Christendom
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
Approacheth to confer about some matter
After the slaughter of so many peers
So many captains gentlemen and soldiers
That in this quarrel have been overthrown
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace
Have we not lost most part of all the towns
By treason falsehood and by treachery
Our great progenitors had conquered
O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief
The utter loss of all the realm of France
WARWICK Be patient York If we conclude a peace
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby
Enter CHARLES ALENCON BASTARD REIGNIER and others
CHARLES Since lords of England it is thus agreed
We come to be informed by yourselves
What the conditions of that league must be
YORK Speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes
By sight of these our baleful enemies
CARDINAL Charles and the rest it is enacted thus
That in regard King Henry gives consent
Of mere compassion and of lenity
To ease your country of distressful war
An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace
You shall become true liegemen to his crown
And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear
To pay him tribute and submit thyself
And still enjoy thy regal dignity
ALENCON Must he be then as shadow of himself
Adorn his temples with a coronet
And yet in substance and authority
Retain but privilege of a private man
This proffer is absurd and reasonless
With more than half the Gallian territories
Detract so much from that prerogative
That which I have than coveting for more
Be cast from possibility of all
YORK Insulting Charles Hast thou by secret means
And now the matter grows to compromise
Of benefit proceeding from our king
And not of any challenge of desert
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars
obstinacy
To cavil in the course of this contract
If once it be neglected ten to one
We shall not find like opportunity
To save your subjects from such massacre
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
By our proceeding in hostility
And therefore take this compact of a truce
Although you break it when your pleasure serves
stand
CHARLES It shall
In any of our towns of garrison
YORK Then swear allegiance to his Majesty
As thou art knight never to disobey
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England
Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England
So now dismiss your army when ye please
Hang up your ensigns let your drums be still
For here we entertain a solemn peace                 Exeunt
SCENE 5
London The palace
Enter SUFFOLK in conference with the KING
GLOUCESTER and EXETER
KING HENRY Your wondrous rare description noble Earl
Her virtues graced with external gifts
And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide
So am I driven by breath of her renown
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
Where I may have fruition of her love
SUFFOLK Tush my good lord This superficial tale
Is but a preface of her worthy praise
The chief perfections of that lovely dame
Had I sufficient skill to utter them
Would make a volume of enticing lines
Able to ravish any dull conceit
And which is more she is not so divine
But with as humble lowliness of mind
She is content to be at your command
Command I mean of virtuous intents
To love and honour Henry as her lord
Therefore my Lord Protector give consent
GLOUCESTER So should I give consent to flatter sin
Unto another lady of esteem
How shall we then dispense with that contract
And not deface your honour with reproach
SUFFOLK As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths
To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists
And therefore may be broke without offence
GLOUCESTER Why what I pray is Margaret more than
that
Her father is no better than an earl
Although in glorious titles he excel
SUFFOLK Yes my lord her father is a king
The King of Naples and Jerusalem
And of such great authority in France
As his alliance will confirm our peace
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance
GLOUCESTER And so the Earl of Armagnac may do
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles
EXETER Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give
That he should be so abject base and poor
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love
Henry is able to enrich his queen
And not to seek a queen to make him rich
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives
Marriage is a matter of more worth
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship
Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects
Must be companion of his nuptial bed
And therefore lords since he affects her most
It most of all these reasons bindeth us
For what is wedlock forced but a hell
An age of discord and continual strife
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss
And is a pattern of celestial peace
Whom should we match with Henry being a king
But Margaret that is daughter to a king
Her peerless feature joined with her birth
Approves her fit for none but for a king
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
More than in women commonly is seen
Will answer our hope in issue of a king
For Henry son unto a conqueror
Is likely to beget more conquerors
If with a lady of so high resolve
Then yield my lords and here conclude with me
That Margaret shall be Queen and none but she
KING HENRY Whether it be through force of your report
My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that
My tender youth was never yet attaint
With any passion of inflaming love
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear
As I am sick with working of my thoughts
Take therefore shipping post my lord to France
Agree to any covenants and procure
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
For your expenses and sufficient charge
Among the people gather up a tenth
Be gone I say for till you do return
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares
And you good uncle banish all offence
If you do censure me by what you were
Not what you are I know it will excuse
This sudden execution of my will
And so conduct me where from company
I may revolve and ruminate my grief                    Exit
GLOUCESTER Ay grief I fear me both at first and last
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece
With hope to find the like event in love
But prosper better than the Troyan did
Margaret shall now be Queen and rule the King
But I will rule both her the King and realm          Exit

SCENE
England
ACT I SCENE I
London The palace
Flourish of trumpets then hautboys Enter the KING DUKE HUMPHREY
OF GLOUCESTER SALISBURY WARWICK and CARDINAL BEAUFORT on the one side
the QUEEN SUFFOLK YORK SOMERSET and BUCKINGHAM on the other
SUFFOLK As by your high imperial Majesty
I had in charge at my depart for France
As procurator to your Excellence
To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace
So in the famous ancient city Tours
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil
The Dukes of Orleans Calaber Bretagne and Alencon
Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops
And humbly now upon my bended knee
In sight of England and her lordly peers
Deliver up my title in the Queen
To your most gracious hands that are the substance
Of that great shadow I did represent
The happiest gift that ever marquis gave
KING HENRY Suffolk arise Welcome Queen Margaret
I can express no kinder sign of love
Than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
A world of earthly blessings to my soul
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts
QUEEN Great King of England and my gracious lord
The mutual conference that my mind hath had
By day by night waking and in my dreams
In courtly company or at my beads
Makes me the bolder to salute my king
With ruder terms such as my wit affords
KING HENRY Her sight did ravish but her grace in speech
Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love
SUFFOLK My Lord Protector so it please your Grace
Here are the articles of contracted peace
Between our sovereign and the French King Charles
For eighteen months concluded by consent
Charles and William de la Pole Marquess of Suffolk ambassador
for Henry King of England that the said Henry shall espouse the
Lady Margaret daughter unto Reignier King of Naples Sicilia
and Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth
of May next ensuing
Item That the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be
KING HENRY Uncle how now
GLOUCESTER Pardon me gracious lord
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
KING HENRY Uncle of Winchester I pray read on
duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over
to the King her father and she sent over of the King of
KING HENRY They please us well Lord Marquess kneel down
We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk
And girt thee with the sword Cousin of York
We here discharge your Grace from being Regent
Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset
Salisbury and Warwick
We thank you all for this great favour done
In entertainment to my princely queen
Come let us in and with all speed provide
Exeunt KING QUEEN and SUFFOLK
GLOUCESTER Brave peers of England pillars of the state
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief
Your grief the common grief of all the land
What did my brother Henry spend his youth
His valour coin and people in the wars
Did he so often lodge in open field
To conquer France his true inheritance
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits
To keep by policy what Henry got
Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham
Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself
With all the learned Council of the realm
Studied so long sat in the Council House
Early and late debating to and fro
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe
And had his Highness in his infancy
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes
And shall these labours and these honours die
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die
O peers of England shameful is this league
Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame
Blotting your names from books of memory
Razing the characters of your renown
Undoing all as all had never been
CARDINAL Nephew what means this passionate discourse
This peroration with such circumstance
GLOUCESTER Ay uncle we will keep it if we can
But now it is impossible we should
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse
SALISBURY Now by the death of Him that died for all
These counties were the keys of Normandy
But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son
WARWICK For grief that they are past recovery
For were there hope to conquer them again
My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears
Anjou and Maine myself did win them both
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer
And are the cities that I got with wounds
Mort Dieu
That dims the honour of this warlike isle
France should have torn and rent my very heart
Before I would have yielded to this league
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives
And our King Henry gives away his own
To match with her that brings no vantages
GLOUCESTER A proper jest and never heard before
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
For costs and charges in transporting her
CARDINAL My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot
It was the pleasure of my lord the King
GLOUCESTER My Lord of Winchester I know your mind
Rancour will out proud prelate in thy face
I see thy fury if I longer stay
We shall begin our ancient bickerings
Lordings farewell and say when I am gone
I prophesied France will be lost ere long              Exit
CARDINAL So there goes our Protector in a rage
Nay more an enemy unto you all
And no great friend I fear me to the King
Consider lords he is the next of blood
And heir apparent to the English crown
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west
Look to it lords let not his smoothing words
Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect
What though the common people favour him
Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice
I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss
He will be found a dangerous Protector
BUCKINGHAM Why should he then protect our sovereign
He being of age to govern of himself
Cousin of Somerset join you with me
And all together with the Duke of Suffolk
CARDINAL This weighty business will not brook delay
And greatness of his place be grief to us
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal
His insolence is more intolerable
Than all the princes in the land beside
BUCKINGHAM Or thou or I Somerset will be Protector
Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET
SALISBURY Pride went before ambition follows him
While these do labour for their own preferment
Behoves it us to labour for the realm
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
Did bear him like a noble gentleman
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal
Warwick my son the comfort of my age
Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey
And brother York thy acts in Ireland
In bringing them to civil discipline
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France
When thou wert Regent for our sovereign
Join we together for the public good
In what we can to bridle and suppress
The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal
While they do tend the profit of the land
WARWICK So God help Warwick as he loves the land
And common profit of his country
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win
And would have kept so long as breath did last
Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine
Which I will win from France or else be slain
Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY
YORK Anjou and Maine are given to the French
Paris is lost the state of Normandy
Stands on a tickle point now they are gone
Suffolk concluded on the articles
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
And purchase friends and give to courtezans
Still revelling like lords till all be gone
While as the silly owner of the goods
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue
Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French
Cold news for me for I had hope of France
A day will come when York shall claim his own
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey
And when I spy advantage claim the crown
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist
Nor wear the diadem upon his head
Then York be still awhile till time do serve
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep
To pry into the secrets of the state
Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love
And in my standard bear the arms of York
To grapple with the house of Lancaster
SCENE II
Enter DUKE and his wife ELEANOR
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows
As frowning at the favours of the world
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight
If so gaze on and grovel on thy face
Until thy head be circled with the same
Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold
And never more abase our sight so low
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground
GLOUCESTER O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts
And may that thought when I imagine ill
Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry
Be my last breathing in this mortal world
My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad
Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot
And on the pieces of the broken wand
And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk
This was my dream what it doth bode God knows
DUCHESS Tut this was nothing but an argument
Shall lose his head for his presumption
But list to me my Humphrey my sweet Duke
Methought I sat in seat of majesty
In the cathedral church of Westminster
And on my head did set the diadem
GLOUCESTER Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright
Art thou not second woman in the realm
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
Above the reach or compass of thy thought
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery
To tumble down thy husband and thyself
Away from me and let me hear no more
DUCHESS What what my lord Are you so choleric
With Eleanor for telling but her dream
Enter a MESSENGER
You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans
Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk
GLOUCESTER I go Come Nell thou wilt ride with us
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and MESSENGER
Follow I must I cannot go before
While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind
Were I a man a duke and next of blood
And smooth my way upon their headless necks
And being a woman I will not be slack
Where are you there Sir John Nay fear not man
Enter HUME
HUME Jesus preserve your royal Majesty
With Margery Jourdain the cunning witch of Eie
With Roger Bolingbroke the conjurer
And will they undertake to do me good
HUME This they have promised to show your Highness
That shall make answer to such questions
As by your Grace shall be propounded him
When from Saint Albans we do make return
Here Hume take this reward make merry man
With thy confederates in this weighty cause            Exit
Marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume
Seal up your lips and give no words but mum
The business asketh silent secrecy
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch
Gold cannot come amiss were she a devil
I dare not say from the rich Cardinal
Yet I do find it so for to be plain
Have hired me to undermine the Duchess
And buzz these conjurations in her brain
Hume if you take not heed you shall go near
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves
Well so its stands and thus I fear at last
Sort how it will I shall have gold for all            Exit
SCENE III
London The palace
will come this way by and by and then we may deliver our
supplications in the quill
man Jesu bless him
Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN
SECOND PETITIONER Come back fool this is the Duke of Suffolk and
not my Lord Protector
SUFFOLK How now fellow Wouldst anything with me
FIRST PETITIONER I pray my lord pardon me I took ye for my Lord
Protector
his lordship Let me see them What is thine
and wife and all from me
SECOND PETITIONER Alas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our
whole township
for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown
heir to the crown
PETER That my master was No forsooth My master said that he
was and that the King was an usurper
of your matter before the King
Exit servant with PETER
QUEEN And as for you that love to be protected
Begin your suits anew and sue to him
Away base cullions Suffolk let them go
QUEEN My Lord of Suffolk say is this the guise
Is this the fashions in the court of England
What shall King Henry be a pupil still
Am I a queen in title and in style
And must be made a subject to a duke
I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours
I thought King Henry had resembled thee
In courage courtship and proportion
But all his mind is bent to holiness
His champions are the prophets and apostles
His weapons holy saws of sacred writ
Are brazen images of canonized saints
I would the college of the Cardinals
Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome
And set the triple crown upon his head
That were a state fit for his holiness
SUFFOLK Madam be patient As I was cause
Your Highness came to England so will I
QUEEN Beside the haughty Protector have we Beaufort
The imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham
And grumbling York and not the least of these
But can do more in England than the King
SUFFOLK And he of these that can do most of all
Cannot do more in England than the Nevils
Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers
QUEEN Not all these lords do vex me half so much
She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies
Strangers in court do take her for the Queen
And in her heart she scorns our poverty
The very train of her worst wearing gown
Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter
That she will light to listen to the lays
And never mount to trouble you again
So let her rest And madam list to me
For I am bold to counsel you in this
Although we fancy not the Cardinal
Yet must we join with him and with the lords
Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace
As for the Duke of York this late complaint
Will make but little for his benefit
And you yourself shall steer the happy helm
Sound a sennet Enter the KING DUKE HUMPHREY
CARDINAL BEAUFORT BUCKINGHAM YORK SOMERSET SALISBURY
WARWICK and the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
KING HENRY For my part noble lords I care not which
SOMERSET If Somerset be unworthy of the place
Let York be Regent I will yield to him
WARWICK Whether your Grace be worthy yea or no
Dispute not that York is the worthier
CARDINAL Ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak
BUCKINGHAM All in this presence are thy betters Warwick
WARWICK Warwick may live to be the best of all
SALISBURY Peace son And show some reason Buckingham
QUEEN Because the King forsooth will have it so
GLOUCESTER Madam the King is old enough himself
QUEEN If he be old enough what needs your Grace
To be Protector of his Excellence
GLOUCESTER Madam I am Protector of the realm
And at his pleasure will resign my place
SUFFOLK Resign it then and leave thine insolence
The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty
Are lank and lean with thy extortions
Have cost a mass of public treasury
BUCKINGHAM Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders hath exceeded law
And left thee to the mercy of the law
QUEEN Thy sale of offices and towns in France
If they were known as the suspect is great
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head
Exit GLOUCESTER The QUEEN drops QUEEN her fan
Give me my fan What minion can ye not
I cry your mercy madam was it you
Could I come near your beauty with my nails
I could set my ten commandments in your face
Though in this place most master wear no breeches
BUCKINGHAM Lord Cardinal I will follow Eleanor
And listen after Humphrey how he proceeds
GLOUCESTER Now lords my choler being overblown
With walking once about the quadrangle
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs
As for your spiteful false objections
Prove them and I lie open to the law
But God in mercy so deal with my soul
As I in duty love my king and country
But to the matter that we have in hand
I say my sovereign York is meetest man
To be your Regent in the realm of France
SUFFOLK Before we make election give me leave
To show some reason of no little force
That York is most unmeet of any man
First for I cannot flatter thee in pride
Next if I be appointed for the place
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here
Without discharge money or furniture
WARWICK That can I witness and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit
SUFFOLK Peace headstrong Warwick
WARWICK Image of pride why should I hold my peace
Enter HORNER the Armourer and his man PETER guarded
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself
YORK Doth any one accuse York for a traitor
SUFFOLK Please it your Majesty this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason
His words were these that Richard Duke of York
Was rightful heir unto the English crown
And that your Majesty was an usurper
KING HENRY Say man were these thy words
villain
speak them to me in the garret one night as we were scouring my
YORK Base dunghill villain and mechanical
I do beseech your royal Majesty
Let him have all the rigour of the law
HORNER` Alas my lord hang me if ever I spake the words My
accuser is my prentice and when I did correct him for his fault
the other day he did vow upon his knees he would be even with
me I have good witness of this therefore I beseech your
accusation
KING HENRY Uncle what shall we say to this in law
GLOUCESTER This doom my lord if I may judge
Because in York this breeds suspicion
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place
SOMERSET I humbly thank your royal Majesty
HORNER And I accept the combat willingly
The spite of man prevaileth against me O Lord have mercy upon
me I shall never be able to fight a blow O Lord my heart
KING HENRY Away with them to prison and the day of combat shall
be the last of the next month

ACT II SCENE I
Saint Albans
Enter the KING QUEEN GLOUCESTER CARDINAL and SUFFOLK
with Falconers halloing
QUEEN Believe me lords for flying at the brook
Yet by your leave the wind was very high
And ten to one old Joan had not gone out
KING HENRY But what a point my lord your falcon made
And what a pitch she flew above the rest
To see how God in all His creatures works
Yea man and birds are fain of climbing high
SUFFOLK No marvel an it like your Majesty
They know their master loves to be aloft
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar
CARDINAL I thought as much he would be above the clouds
GLOUCESTER Ay my lord Cardinal how think you by that
Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven
KING HENRY The treasury of everlasting joy
CARDINAL Thy heaven is on earth thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown the treasure of thy heart
Pernicious Protector dangerous peer
GLOUCESTER What Cardinal is your priesthood grown peremptory
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae
Churchmen so hot Good uncle hide such malice
With such holiness can you do it
SUFFOLK No malice sir no more than well becomes
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer
GLOUCESTER As who my lord

GLOUCESTER Why Suffolk England knows thine insolence
QUEEN And thy ambition Gloucester

Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly
GLOUCESTER True uncle

KING HENRY Why how now uncle Gloucester
GLOUCESTER Talking of hawking nothing else my lord
Or all my fence shall fail
KING HENRY The winds grow high so do your stomachs lords
How irksome is this music to my heart
When such strings jar what hope of harmony
I pray my lords let me compound this strife
GLOUCESTER What means this noise
Fellow what miracle dost thou proclaim
TOWNSMAN A miracle A miracle

GLOUCESTER What and wouldst climb a tree
SIMPCOX But that in all my life when I was a youth
WIFE Too true and bought his climbing very dear

GLOUCESTER Nor his
SIMPCOX No indeed master
SIMPCOX Saunder Simpcox an if it please you master
Christendom If thou hadst been born blind thou mightst as well
have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we
do wear Sight may distinguish of colours but suddenly to
nominate them all it is impossible My lords Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle and would ye not think his cunning to be
great that could restore this cripple to his legs again
SIMPCOX O master that you could

KING HENRY O God seest Thou this and bearest so long
QUEEN It made me laugh to see the villain run
GLOUCESTER Follow the knave and take this drab away

GLOUCESTER But you have done more miracles than I
You made in a day my lord whole towns to fly
Enter BUCKINGHAM
KING HENRY What tidings with our cousin Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold
A sort of naughty persons lewdly bent
Under the countenance and confederacy
The ringleader and head of all this rout
Dealing with witches and with conjurers
Whom we have apprehended in the fact
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground
As more at large your Grace shall understand
CARDINAL And so my Lord Protector by this means
Your lady is forthcoming yet at London
GLOUCESTER Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart
Or to the meanest groom
KING HENRY O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby
QUEEN Gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest
And look thyself be faultless thou wert best
GLOUCESTER Madam for myself to heaven I do appeal
And for my wife I know not how it stands
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard
Noble she is but if she have forgot
As like to pitch defile nobility
I banish her my bed and company
And give her as a prey to law and shame
KING HENRY Well for this night we will repose us here
To look into this business thoroughly
And call these foul offenders to their answers
Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails
Flourish Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter YORK SALISBURY and WARWICK
YORK Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
Our simple supper ended give me leave
In this close walk to satisfy myself
In craving your opinion of my tide
SALISBURY My lord I long to hear it at full
WARWICK Sweet York begin and if thy claim be good
The Nevils are thy subjects to command
YORK Then thus
Edward the Third my lords had seven sons
The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales
The second William of Hatfield and the third
Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom
Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster
The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester
William of Windsor was the seventh and last
Edward the Black Prince died before his father
And left behind him Richard his only son
Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt
Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came
And him to Pomfret where as all you know
Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously
WARWICK Father the Duke hath told the truth
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown
YORK Which now they hold by force and not by right
SALISBURY But William of Hatfield died without an heir
YORK The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line
I claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughter
Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March
Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March
Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor
SALISBURY This Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke
As I have read laid claim unto the crown
And but for Owen Glendower had been king
Who kept him in captivity till he died
But to the rest
YORK His eldest sister Anne
My mother being heir unto the crown
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was
By her I claim the kingdom she was heir
To Roger Earl of March who was the son
Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence
So if the issue of the elder son
Succeed before the younger I am King
WARWICK What plain proceedings is more plain than this
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt
The fourth son York claims it from the third
It fails not yet but flourishes in thee
And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock
Then father Salisbury kneel we together
And in this private plot be we the first
That shall salute our rightful sovereign
With honour of his birthright to the crown
YORK We thank you lords But I am not your king
But with advice and silent secrecy
Do you as I do in these dangerous days
At Buckingham and all the crew of them
That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey
Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy
SALISBURY My lord break we off we know your mind at full
WARWICK My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king
YORK And Nevil this I do assure myself
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
The greatest man in England but the King             Exeunt
SCENE III
London A hall of justice
Sound trumpets Enter the KING and State the QUEEN GLOUCESTER YORK
SUFFOLK and SALISBURY with guard to banish the DUCHESS Enter guarded
the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER MARGERY JOURDAIN HUME SOUTHWELL and BOLINGBROKE
In sight of God and us your guilt is great
Receive the sentence of the law for sins
You four from hence to prison back again
From thence unto the place of execution
The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows
You madam for you are more nobly born
Despoiled of your honour in your life
Live in your country here in banishment
With Sir John Stanley in the Isle of Man
DUCHESS Welcome is banishment welcome were my death
GLOUCESTER Eleanor the law thou seest hath judged thee
I cannot justify whom the law condemns
Exeunt the DUCHESS and the other prisoners guarded
Mine eyes are full of tears my heart of grief
Ah Humphrey this dishonour in thine age
Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground
I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease
KING HENRY Stay Humphrey Duke of Gloucester ere thou go
Give up thy staff Henry will to himself
Protector be and God shall be my hope
My stay my guide and lantern to my feet
Than when thou wert Protector to thy King
QUEEN I see no reason why a king of years
Should be to be protected like a child
Give up your staff sir and the King his realm
GLOUCESTER My staff Here noble Henry is my staff
As willingly do I the same resign
As ere thy father Henry made it mine
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
As others would ambitiously receive it
Farewell good King when I am dead and gone
May honourable peace attend thy throne                 Exit
QUEEN Why now is Henry King and Margaret Queen
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself
This staff of honour raught there let it stand
SUFFOLK Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays
YORK Lords let him go Please it your Majesty
This is the day appointed for the combat
And ready are the appellant and defendant
The armourer and his man to enter the lists
So please your Highness to behold the fight
QUEEN Ay good my lord for purposely therefore
Left I the court to see this quarrel tried
Here let them end it and God defend the right
YORK I never saw a fellow worse bested
Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant
The servant of his armourer my lords
Enter at one door HORNER the Armourer and his
NEIGHBOURS drinking to him so much that he is
drunk and he enters with a drum before him and
other door PETER his man with a drum and sandbag
and PRENTICES drinking to him
FIRST NEIGHBOUR Here neighbour Horner I drink to you in a cup of
sack and fear not neighbour you shall do well enough

FIRST PRENTICE Here Peter I drink to thee and be not afraid
SECOND PRENTICE Be merry Peter and fear not thy master fight

if I die I give thee my apron and Will thou shalt have my
hammer and here Tom take all the money that I have O Lord

SALISBURY Come leave your drinking and fall to blows
PETER Peter forsooth

PETER Thump
SALISBURY Thump Then see thou thump thy master well

HORNER Hold Peter hold I confess I confess treason
YORK Take away his weapon Fellow thank God and the good wine in

KING HENRY Go take hence that traitor from our sight
For by his death we do perceive his guilt
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow
Come fellow follow us for thy reward
Sound a flourish Exeunt
SCENE IV
London A street
Enter DUKE HUMPHREY and his men in mourning cloaks
GLOUCESTER Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud
And after summer evermore succeeds
Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold
So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet
GLOUCESTER Ten is the hour that was appointed me
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets
Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook
The abject people gazing on thy face
With envious looks laughing at thy shame
That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets
Enter the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER in a white sheet
and a taper burning in her hand with SIR JOHN
STANLEY the SHERIFF and OFFICERS
GLOUCESTER No stir not for your lives let her pass by
DUCHESS Come you my lord to see my open shame
Now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze
See how the giddy multitude do point
And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee
Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks
And in thy closet pent up rue my shame
And ban thine enemies both mine and thine
GLOUCESTER Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief
DUCHESS Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself
For whilst I think I am thy married wife
And thou a prince Protector of this land
Methinks I should not thus be led along
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet
And when I start the envious people laugh
And bid me be advised how I tread
Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun
No dark shall be my light and night my day
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell
And he a prince and ruler of the land
As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess
To every idle rascal follower
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
Hang over thee as sure it shortly will
And York and impious Beaufort that false priest
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes
GLOUCESTER Ah Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry
I must offend before I be attainted
And had I twenty times so many foes
And each of them had twenty times their power
All these could not procure me any scathe
So long as I am loyal true and crimeless
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach
But I in danger for the breach of law
Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell
I pray thee sort thy heart to patience
Enter a HERALD
Holden at Bury the first of this next month
This is close dealing Well I will be there    Exit HERALD
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
To take her with him to the Isle of Man
GLOUCESTER Must you Sir John protect my lady here
GLOUCESTER Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
You use her well the world may laugh again
And I may live to do you kindness if
You do it her And so Sir John farewell
DUCHESS What gone my lord and bid me not farewell
GLOUCESTER Witness my tears I cannot stay to speak
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and servants
DUCHESS Art thou gone too All comfort go with thee
Death at whose name I oft have been afeard
Stanley I prithee go and take me hence
I care not whither for I beg no favour
Only convey me where thou art commanded
STANLEY Why madam that is to the Isle of Man
DUCHESS Sheriff farewell and better than I fare
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame
SHERIFF It is my office and madam pardon me
Come Stanley shall we go
STANLEY Madam your penance done throw off this sheet
And go we to attire you for our journey
DUCHESS My shame will not be shifted with my sheet
No it will hang upon my richest robes
And show itself attire me how I can
Go lead the way I long to see my prison            Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
The Abbey at Bury St Edmunds
Sound a sennet Enter the KING the QUEEN CARDINAL SUFFOLK YORK
BUCKINGHAM SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament
KING HENRY I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come
QUEEN Can you not see or will ye not observe
With what a majesty he bears himself
How insolent of late he is become
How proud how peremptory and unlike himself
We know the time since he was mild and affable
Immediately he was upon his knee
But meet him now and be it in the morn
When every one will give the time of day
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee
Disdaining duty that to us belongs
Small curs are not regarded when they grin
But great men tremble when the lion roars
And Humphrey is no little man in England
First note that he is near you in descent
And should you fall he is the next will mount
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
That he should come about your royal person
And when he please to make commotion
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry
The reverent care I bear unto my lord
Made me collect these dangers in the Duke
Which fear if better reasons can supplant
My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York
Reprove my allegation if you can
Or else conclude my words effectual
SUFFOLK Well hath your Highness seen into this duke
And had I first been put to speak my mind
The Duchess by his subornation
Upon my life began her devilish practices
Or if he were not privy to those faults
And such high vaunts of his nobility
Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
And in his simple show he harbours treason
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb
No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit
CARDINAL Did he not contrary to form of law
Devise strange deaths for small offences done
YORK And did he not in his protectorship
Levy great sums of money through the realm
By means whereof the towns each day revolted
BUCKINGHAM Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown
Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey
KING HENRY My lords at once the care you have of us
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
From meaning treason to our royal person
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove
The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given
To dream on evil or to work my downfall
Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit
Take heed my lord the welfare of us all
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man
Enter SOMERSET
SOMERSET All health unto my gracious sovereign
KING HENRY Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France
SOMERSET That all your interest in those territories
Is utterly bereft you all is lost
As firmly as I hope for fertile England
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
And caterpillars eat my leaves away
But I will remedy this gear ere long
Or sell my title for a glorious grave
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER All happiness unto my lord the King
SUFFOLK Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art
I do arrest thee of high treason here
GLOUCESTER Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush
Nor change my countenance for this arrest
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted
The purest spring is not so free from mud
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign
Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty
By means whereof his Highness hath lost France
GLOUCESTER Is it but thought so What are they that think it
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France
Or any groat I hoarded to my use
No many a pound of mine own proper store
Because I would not tax the needy commons
Have I dispursed to the garrisons
CARDINAL It serves you well my lord to say so much
GLOUCESTER I say no more than truth so help me God
YORK In your protectorship you did devise
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of
Pity was all the fault that was in me
And lowly words were ransom for their fault
Unless it were a bloody murderer
I never gave them condign punishment
Above the felon or what trespass else
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself
And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
To keep until your further time of trial
That you will clear yourself from all suspense
My conscience tells me you are innocent
GLOUCESTER Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous
Foul subornation is predominant
I know their complot is to have my life
And if my death might make this island happy
And prove the period of their tyranny
I would expend it with all willingness
But mine is made the prologue to their play
For thousands more that yet suspect no peril
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy
Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
The envious load that lies upon his heart
And dogged York that reaches at the moon
By false accuse doth level at my life
And you my sovereign lady with the rest
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head
My liefest liege to be mine enemy
And all to make away my guiltless life
I shall not want false witness to condemn me
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt
The ancient proverb will be well effected
CARDINAL My liege his railing is intolerable
If those that care to keep your royal person
Be thus upbraided chid and rated at
And the offender granted scope of speech
SUFFOLK Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
As if she had suborned some to swear
QUEEN But I can give the loser leave to chide
GLOUCESTER Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed
And well such losers may have leave to speak
Lord Cardinal he is your prisoner
CARDINAL Sirs take away the Duke and guard him sure
GLOUCESTER Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch
Before his legs be firm to bear his body
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first
Ah that my fear were false ah that it were
For good King Henry thy decay I fear        Exit guarded
KING HENRY My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best
Do or undo as if ourself were here
QUEEN What will your Highness leave the Parliament
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes
Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see
The map of honour truth and loyalty
And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come
What louring star now envies thy estate
That these great lords and Margaret our Queen
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life
Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong
And as the butcher takes away the calf
And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence
And as the dam runs lowing up and down
Looking the way her harmless young one went
Look after him and cannot do him good
So mighty are his vowed enemies
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers
That for the beauty thinks it excellent
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world
To rid us from the fear we have of him
CARDINAL That he should die is worthy policy
But yet we want a colour for his death
SUFFOLK But in my mind that were no policy
The King will labour still to save his life
The commons haply rise to save his life
And yet we have but trivial argument
More than mistrust that shows him worthy death
YORK So that by this you would not have him die
SUFFOLK Ah York no man alive so fain as I
But my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk
Say as you think and speak it from your souls
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite
QUEEN So the poor chicken should be sure of death
To make the fox surveyor of the fold
His guilt should be but idly posted over
Because his purpose is not executed
No let him die in that he is a fox
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him
Be it by gins by snares by subtlety
So he be dead for that is good deceit
Which mates him first that first intends deceit
SUFFOLK Not resolute except so much were done
For things are often spoke and seldom meant
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue
Seeing the deed is meritorious
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe
Say but the word and I will be his priest
CARDINAL But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk
Ere you can take due orders for a priest
Say you consent and censure well the deed
I tender so the safety of my liege
SUFFOLK Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing
QUEEN And so say I
YORK And I And now we three have spoke it
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom
Enter a POST
POST Great lords from Ireland am I come amain
To signify that rebels there are up
And put the Englishmen unto the sword
Send succours lords and stop the rage betime
Before the wound do grow uncurable
For being green there is great hope of help
CARDINAL A breach that craves a quick expedient stop
What counsel give you in this weighty cause
YORK That Somerset be sent as Regent thither
Witness the fortune he hath had in France
Had been the Regent there instead of me
YORK No not to lose it all as thou hast done
I rather would have lost my life betimes
Than bring a burden of dishonour home
By staying there so long till all were lost
QUEEN Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with
No more good York sweet Somerset be still
Thy fortune York hadst thou been Regent there
YORK What worse than nought Nay then a shame take all
SOMERSET And in the number thee that wishest shame
CARDINAL My Lord of York try what your fortune is
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen
To Ireland will you lead a band of men
Collected choicely from each county some
And try your hap against the Irishmen
YORK I will my lord so please his Majesty
SUFFOLK Why our authority is his consent
And what we do establish he confirms
Then noble York take thou this task in hand
YORK I am content provide me soldiers lords
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey
CARDINAL No more of him for I will deal with him
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more
And so break off the day is almost spent
Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event
YORK My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days
At Bristol I expect my soldiers
Exeunt all but YORK
YORK Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts
And change misdoubt to resolution
And find no harbour in a royal heart
And not a thought but thinks on dignity
My brain more busy than the labouring spider
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies
To send me packing with an host of men
I fear me you but warm the starved snake
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band
I will stir up in England some black storm
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
Until the golden circuit on my head
And for a minister of my intent
John Cade of Ashford
To make commotion as full well he can
Under the tide of John Mortimer
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns
And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells
Hath he conversed with the enemy
And given me notice of their villainies
This devil here shall be my substitute
For that John Mortimer which now is dead
In face in gait in speech he doth resemble
How they affect the house and claim of York
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Why then from Ireland come I with my strength
For Humphrey being dead as he shall be
And Henry put apart the next for me                   Exit
SCENE II
Bury St Edmunds A room of state
Enter two or three MURDERERS running over the stage
from the murder of DUKE HUMPHREY
FIRST MURDERER Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know
SECOND MURDERER O that it were to do What have we done
Didst ever hear a man so penitent
Enter SUFFOLK
FIRST MURDERER Here comes my lord
I will reward you for this venturous deed
The King and all the peers are here at hand
Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well
According as I gave directions
SUFFOLK Away be gone                       Exeunt MURDERERS
Sound trumpets Enter the KING the QUEEN
CARDINAL SOMERSET with attendants
KING HENRY Go call our uncle to our presence straight
KING HENRY Lords take your places and I pray you all
Than from true evidence of good esteem
QUEEN God forbid any malice should prevail
That faultless may condemn a nobleman
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion
KING HENRY I thank thee Meg these words content me much
SUFFOLK Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead
QUEEN Marry God forfend
The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word
QUEEN How fares my lord Help lords The King is dead
SOMERSET Rear up his body wring him by the nose
QUEEN Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes
SUFFOLK He doth revive again madam be patient
KING O heavenly God
QUEEN How fares my gracious lord
SUFFOLK Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort
KING HENRY What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren
By crying comfort from a hollow breast
Can chase away the first conceived sound
Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say
Thou baleful messenger out of my sight
Sits in grim majesty to fright the world
Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding
Yet do not go away come basilisk
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight
QUEEN Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus
Although the Duke was enemy to him
I would be blind with weeping sick with groans
And all to have the noble Duke alive
What know I how the world may deem of me
For it is known we were but hollow friends
This get I by his death Ay me unhappy
KING HENRY Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man
QUEEN Be woe for me more wretched than he is
What dost thou turn away and hide thy face
What art thou like the adder waxen deaf
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen
Erect his statue and worship it
And make my image but an alehouse sign
Drove back again unto my native clime
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer
But left that hateful office unto thee
With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness
And would not dash me with their ragged sides
Because thy flinty heart more hard than they
Might in thy palace perish Margaret
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back
I stood upon the hatches in the storm
And when the dusky sky began to rob
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
To sit and witch me as Ascanius did
When he to madding Dido would unfold
Ay me I can no more Die Margaret
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long
Noise within Enter WARWICK SALISBURY
and many commons
WARWICK It is reported mighty sovereign
The commons like an angry hive of bees
That want their leader scatter up and down
And care not who they sting in his revenge
Until they hear the order of his death
But how he died God knows not Henry
Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse
And comment then upon his sudden death
WARWICK That shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury
With the rude multitude till I return                  Exit
Exit SALISBURY with the commons
My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul
If my suspect be false forgive me God
For judgment only doth belong to Thee
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
With twenty thousand kisses and to drain
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk
But all in vain are these mean obsequies
And to survey his dead and earthy image
What were it but to make my sorrow greater
Bed put forth with the body Enter WARWICK
WARWICK Come hither gracious sovereign view this body
KING HENRY That is to see how deep my grave is made
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace
For seeing him I see my life in death
WARWICK As surely as my soul intends to live
With that dread King that took our state upon Him
I do believe that violent hands were laid
SUFFOLK A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow
WARWICK See how the blood is settled in his face
Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless
Being all descended to the labouring heart
Who in the conflict that it holds with death
To blush and beautify the cheek again
But see his face is black and full of blood
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man
Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking
The least of all these signs were probable
SUFFOLK Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection
And we I hope sir are no murderers
And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep
QUEEN Then you belike suspect these noblemen
WARWICK Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe
But may imagine how the bird was dead
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak
Even so suspicious is this tragedy
SUFFOLK I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
Exeunt CARDINAL SOMERSET and others
WARWICK What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him
QUEEN He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times
For every word you speak in his behalf
Is slander to your royal dignity
Thy mother took into her blameful bed
WARWICK But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech
That thou thyself was born in bastardy
And after all this fearful homage done
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell
SUFFOLK Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood
WARWICK Away even now or I will drag thee hence
Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK
KING HENRY What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted
QUEEN What noise is this
KING Why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn
Here in our presence Dare you be so bold
Why what tumultuous clamour have we here
Set all upon me mighty sovereign
shall know your mind
Dread lord the commons send you word by me
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death
They will by violence tear him from your palace
They say by him the good Duke Humphrey died
And mere instinct of love and loyalty
Free from a stubborn opposite intent
As being thought to contradict your liking
Makes them thus forward in his banishment
They say in care of your most royal person
That if your Highness should intend to sleep
And charge that no man should disturb your rest
In pain of your dislike or pain of death
Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict
Were there a serpent seen with forked tongue
That slily glided towards your Majesty
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal
And therefore do they cry though you forbid
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is
With whose envenomed and fatal sting
Your loving uncle twenty times his worth
They say is shamefully bereft of life
Could send such message to their sovereign
To show how quaint an orator you are
But all the honour Salisbury hath won
Is that he was the lord ambassador
Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King
KING HENRY Go Salisbury and tell them all from me
I thank them for their tender loving care
And had I not been cited so by them
Yet did I purpose as they do entreat
For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy
And therefore by His Majesty I swear
Whose far unworthy deputy I am
He shall not breathe infection in this air
But three days longer on the pain of death
Exit SALISBURY
QUEEN O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk
KING HENRY Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk
No more I say if thou dost plead for him
Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath
Had I but said I would have kept my word
But when I swear it is irrevocable
On any ground that I am ruler of
The world shall not be ransom for thy life
Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me
I have great matters to impart to thee
Exeunt all but QUEEN and SUFFOLK
QUEEN Mischance and sorrow go along with you
Be playfellows to keep you company
And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps
SUFFOLK Cease gentle Queen these execrations
And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave
Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy
SUFFOLK A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them
I would invent as bitter searching terms
As curst as harsh and horrible to hear
With full as many signs of deadly hate
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint
Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban
Should I not curse them Poison be their drink
Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees
Or like an overcharged gun recoil
And turns the force of them upon thyself
SUFFOLK You bade me ban and will you bid me leave
Though standing naked on a mountain top
Where biting cold would never let grass grow
And think it but a minute spent in sport
QUEEN O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand
That I may dew it with my mournful tears
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
To wash away my woeful monuments
O could this kiss be printed in thy hand
So get thee gone that I may know my grief
As one that surfeits thinking on a want
Adventure to be banished myself
And banished I am if but from thee
Go speak not to me even now be gone
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves
Loather a hundred times to part than die
Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee
SUFFOLK Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished
Once by the King and three times thrice by thee
A wilderness is populous enough
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company
For where thou art there is the world itself
With every several pleasure in the world
And where thou art not desolation
I can no more Live thou to joy thy life
Enter VAUX
QUEEN Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee
VAUX To signify unto his Majesty
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth
Were by his side sometime he calls the King
And whispers to his pillow as to him
The secrets of his overcharged soul
And I am sent to tell his Majesty
That even now he cries aloud for him
QUEEN Go tell this heavy message to the King       Exit VAUX
Ay me What is this world What news are these
Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee
If thou be found by me thou art but dead
SUFFOLK If I depart from thee I cannot live
And in thy sight to die what were it else
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap
Here could I breathe my soul into the air
Where from thy sight I should be raging mad
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul
Or I should breathe it so into thy body
To die by thee were but to die in jest
From thee to die were torture more than death
O let me stay befall what may befall
QUEEN Away Though parting be a fretful corrosive
It is applied to a deathful wound
To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee
SUFFOLK I go
That ever did contain a thing of worth
Even as a splitted bark so sunder we
This way fall I to death
QUEEN This way for me                       Exeunt severally
SCENE III
Enter the KING SALISBURY and WARWICK to the CARDINAL in bed
KING HENRY How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign
Enough to purchase such another island
So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain
KING HENRY Ah what a sign it is of evil life
WARWICK Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee
CARDINAL Bring me unto my trial when you will
Died he not in his bed Where should he die
O torture me no more I will confess
Alive again Then show me where he is
He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them
Comb down his hair look look it stands upright
Give me some drink and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him
KING HENRY O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch
O beat away the busy meddling fiend
And from his bosom purge this black despair
WARWICK See how the pangs of death do make him grin
SALISBURY Disturb him not let him pass peaceably
Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope
He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him
WARWICK So bad a death argues a monstrous life
KING HENRY Forbear to judge for we are sinners all
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close
And let us all to meditation                         Exeunt

SUFFOLK and other GENTLEMEN as prisoners
LIEUTENANT The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day
Is crept into the bosom of the sea
That drag the tragic melancholy night
Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings
Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air
Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize
For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs
Here shall they make their ransom on the sand
Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore
Master this prisoner freely give I thee
And thou that art his mate make boot of this
The other Walter Whitmore is thy share
FIRST GENTLEMAN What is my ransom master let me know
MASTER A thousand crowns or else lay down your head
MATE And so much shall you give or off goes yours
LIEUTENANT What think you much to pay two thousand crowns
And bear the name and port of gentlemen
The lives of those which we have lost in fight
SECOND GENTLEMAN And so will I and write home for it straight
WHITMORE I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard
And so should these if I might have my will
LIEUTENANT Be not so rash take ransom let him live
SUFFOLK Look on my George I am a gentleman
Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid
WHITMORE And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore
SUFFOLK Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death
A cunning man did calculate my birth
And told me that by water I should die
Thy name is Gualtier being rightly sounded
WHITMORE Gualtier or Walter which it is I care not
Never yet did base dishonour blur our name
SUFFOLK Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince
The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole
WHITMORE The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags
SUFFOLK Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke
LIEUTENANT But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be
The honourable blood of Lancaster
Must not be shed by such a jaded groom
And thought thee happy when I shook my head
How often hast thou waited at my cup
When I have feasted with Queen Margaret
Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride
And duly waited for my coming forth
This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf
And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue
WHITMORE Speak Captain shall I stab the forlorn swain
LIEUTENANT First let my words stab him as he hath me
SUFFOLK Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou
Strike off his head
LIEUTENANT Poole
SUFFOLK Poole
LIEUTENANT Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt
Troubles the silver spring where England drinks
Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
For swallowing the treasure of the realm
Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain
Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again
And wedded be thou to the hags of hell
For daring to affy a mighty lord
Unto the daughter of a worthless king
Having neither subject wealth nor diadem
By devilish policy art thou grown great
By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France
The false revolting Normans thorough thee
Disdain to call us lord and Picardy
And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home
The princely Warwick and the Nevils all
Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain
As hating thee are rising up in arms
By shameful murder of a guiltless king
Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours
The commons here in Kent are up in arms
And to conclude reproach and beggary
Is crept into the palace of our King
And all by thee Away convey him hence
SUFFOLK O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder
Upon these paltry servile abject drudges
Small things make base men proud this villain here
Being captain of a pinnace threatens more
Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate
It is impossible that I should die
By such a lowly vassal as thyself
Thy words move rage and not remorse in me
I go of message from the Queen to France
I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel
WHITMORE Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death
SUFFOLK Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear
WHITMORE Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee
What are ye daunted now Now will ye stoop
FIRST GENTLEMAN My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair
Far be it we should honour such as these
With humble suit no rather let my head
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
Save to the God of heaven and to my king
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
True nobility is exempt from fear
More can I bear than you dare execute
LIEUTENANT Hale him away and let him talk no more
SUFFOLK Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can
Great men oft die by vile bezonians
A Roman sworder and banditto slave
Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates
Exit WALTER with SUFFOLK
LIEUTENANT And as for these whose ransom we have set
It is our pleasure one of them depart
Therefore come you with us and let him go
Exeunt all but the FIRST GENTLEMAN
WHITMORE There let his head and lifeless body lie
Until the Queen his mistress bury it                   Exit
FIRST GENTLEMAN O barbarous and bloody spectacle
His body will I bear unto the King
If he revenge it not yet will his friends
So will the Queen that living held him dear
Exit with the body

SAY Hear me but speak and bear me where you will
Kent in the Commentaries Caesar writ
Sweet is the country because full of riches
The people liberal valiant active wealthy
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity
I sold not Maine I lost not Normandy
Yet to recover them would lose my life
Justice with favour have I always done
When have I aught exacted at your hands
But to maintain the King the realm and you
And seeing ignorance is the curse of God
Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven
You cannot but forbear to murder me
For your behoof

till you had recovered your ancient freedom But you are all
recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the
nobility Let them break your backs with burdens take your
houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before
light upon you all
CLIFFORD Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth
Will he conduct you through the heart of France
And make the meanest of you earls and dukes
Alas he hath no home no place to fly to
Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil
Unless by robbing of your friends and us
The fearful French whom you late vanquished
Methinks already in this civil broil
I see them lording it in London streets
To France to France and get what you have lost
Spare England for it is your native coast
Henry hath money you are strong and manly
God on our side doubt not of victory
CADE Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this
multitude The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred
mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate I see them lay their
heads together to surprise me My sword make way for me for here
is no staying In despite of the devils and hell have through

thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore on a brick

must serve me to feed on
Enter IDEN
IDEN Lord who would live turmoiled in the court
And may enjoy such quiet walks as these
This small inheritance my father left me
Contenteth me and worth a monarchy
Or gather wealth I care not with what envy
Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
And sends the poor well pleased from my gate
betray me and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my
swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part
I know thee not why then should I betray thee
And like a thief to come to rob my grounds
Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner
But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms
beard thee too Look on me well I have eat no meat these five
days yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you
more
That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent
See if thou canst outface me with thy looks
Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser
Thy hand is but a finger to my fist
Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon
My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast
And if mine arm be heaved in the air
As for words whose greatness answers words
Let this my sword report what speech forbears
CADE By my valour the most complete champion that ever I heard
clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath I beseech
me Let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the
be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house
because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled
Sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed
To emblaze the honour that thy master got
CADE Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell Kent from
me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be
cowards for I that never feared any am vanquished by famine
Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee
And as I thrust thy body in with my sword
So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell
Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave
And there cut off thy most ungracious head
Which I will bear in triumph to the King
Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon               Exit

ACT V SCENE I
Fields between Dartford and Blackheath
Enter YORK and his army of Irish with drum and colours
YORK From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right
Ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright
Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear
Let them obey that knows not how to rule
This hand was made to handle nought but gold
I cannot give due action to my words
Except a sword or sceptre balance it
A sceptre shall it have have I a soul
Enter BUCKINGHAM
The King hath sent him sure I must dissemble
BUCKINGHAM York if thou meanest well I greet thee well
YORK Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting
Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure
BUCKINGHAM A messenger from Henry our dread liege
To know the reason of these arms in peace
Or why thou being a subject as I am
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn
Should raise so great a power without his leave
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court
O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint
I am so angry at these abject terms
And now like Ajax Telamonius
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury
I am far better born than is the King
More like a king more kingly in my thoughts
But I must make fair weather yet awhile
Buckingham I prithee pardon me
That I have given no answer all this while
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy
The cause why I have brought this army hither
Is to remove proud Somerset from the King
Seditious to his Grace and to the state
BUCKINGHAM That is too much presumption on thy part
But if thy arms be to no other end
The King hath yielded unto thy demand
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower
YORK Upon thine honour is he prisoner
BUCKINGHAM Upon mine honour he is prisoner
Soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves
You shall have pay and everything you wish
And let my sovereign virtuous Henry
Command my eldest son nay all my sons
As pledges of my fealty and love
Lands goods horse armour anything I have
Is his to use so Somerset may die
BUCKINGHAM York I commend this kind submission
Enter the KING and attendants
KING HENRY Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm
YORK In all submission and humility
York doth present himself unto your Highness
KING HENRY Then what intends these forces thou dost bring
YORK To heave the traitor Somerset from hence
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade
Who since I heard to be discomfited
IDEN If one so rude and of so mean condition
May pass into the presence of a king
The head of Cade whom I in combat slew
KING HENRY The head of Cade Great God how just art Thou
O let me view his visage being dead
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble
Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him
A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king
He were created knight for his good service
We give thee for reward a thousand marks
And will that thou thenceforth attend on us
IDEN May Iden live to merit such a bounty
And never live but true unto his liege
Enter the QUEEN and SOMERSET
Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke
QUEEN For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head
But boldly stand and front him to his face
YORK How now Is Somerset at liberty
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset
False king why hast thou broken faith with me
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse
King did I call thee No thou art not king
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes
That head of thine doth not become a crown
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine
Is able with the change to kill and cure
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
And with the same to act controlling laws
Give place By heaven thou shalt rule no more
SOMERSET O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York
Obey audacious traitor kneel for grace
YORK Wouldst have me kneel First let me ask of these
If they can brook I bow a knee to man
Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail        Exit attendant
I know ere thy will have me go to ward
QUEEN Call hither Clifford bid him come amain
To say if that the bastard boys of York
Shall be the surety for their traitor father
Exit BUCKINGHAM
The sons of York thy betters in their birth
That for my surety will refuse the boys
Enter EDWARD and RICHARD PLANTAGENET
Enter CLIFFORD and his SON
QUEEN And here comes Clifford to deny their bail
CLIFFORD Health and all happiness to my lord the King
YORK I thank thee Clifford Say what news with thee
Nay do not fright us with an angry look
We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again
For thy mistaking so we pardon thee
CLIFFORD This is my King York I do not mistake
But thou mistakes me much to think I do
To Bedlam with him Is the man grown mad
KING HENRY Ay Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour
Makes him oppose himself against his king
CLIFFORD He is a traitor let him to the Tower
And chop away that factious pate of his
QUEEN He is arrested but will not obey
His sons he says shall give their words for him
YORK Will you not sons
EDWARD Ay noble father if our words will serve
RICHARD And if words will not then our weapons shall
CLIFFORD Why what a brood of traitors have we here
YORK Look in a glass and call thy image so
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears
That with the very shaking of their chains
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me
Enter the EARLS OF WARWICK and SALISBURY
And manacle the berard in their chains
Run back and bite because he was withheld
And such a piece of service will you do
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick
CLIFFORD Hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape
YORK Nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon
CLIFFORD Take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves
KING HENRY Why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow
Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair
Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles
O where is faith O where is loyalty
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war
And shame thine honourable age with blood
Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it
For shame In duty bend thy knee to me
That bows unto the grave with mickle age
SALISBURY My lord I have considered with myself
The tide of this most renowned duke
And in my conscience do repute his Grace
KING HENRY Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me
SALISBURY I have
KING HENRY Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath
SALISBURY It is great sin to swear unto a sin
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath
Who can be bound by any solemn vow
To reave the orphan of his patrimony
And have no other reason for this wrong
But that he was bound by a solemn oath
QUEEN A subtle traitor needs no sophister
KING HENRY Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself
YORK Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast
CLIFFORD The first I warrant thee if dreams prove true
WARWICK You were best to go to bed and dream again
To keep thee from the tempest of the field
Might I but know thee by thy household badge
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm
Even to affright thee with the view thereof
And tread it under foot with all contempt
Despite the berard that protects the bear
YOUNG CLIFFORD And so to arms victorious father
To quell the rebels and their complices
RICHARD Fie charity for shame Speak not in spite
Exeunt severally
SCENE II
Saint Albans
Alarums to the battle Enter WARWICK
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear
Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
Clifford I say come forth and fight with me
Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland
WARWICK is hoarse with calling thee to arms
Enter YORK
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
Enter OLD CLIFFORD
WARWICK Of one or both of us the time is come
YORK Hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase
For I myself must hunt this deer to death
CLIFFORD What seest thou in me York Why dost thou pause
YORK With thy brave bearing should I be in love
But that thou art so fast mine enemy
CLIFFORD Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem
YORK So let it help me now against thy sword
As I in justice and true right express it
CLIFFORD My soul and body on the action both
YORK A dreadful lay Address thee instantly
YORK Thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still
Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will         Exit
Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD
YOUNG CLIFFORD Shame and confusion All is on the rout
Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds
Where it should guard O war thou son of hell
Whom angry heavens do make their minister
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly
He that is truly dedicate to war
Hath not essentially but by circumstance
O let the vile world end
And the premised flames of the last day
Knit earth and heaven together
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast
Particularities and petty sounds
To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve
The silver livery of advised age
To die in ruffian battle Even at this sight
It shall be stony York not our old men spares
No more will I their babes Tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity
Meet I an infant of the house of York
Into as many gobbets will I cut it
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did
In cruelty will I seek out my fame
As did Aeneas old Anchises bear
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders
But then Aeneas bare a living load
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine
Exit with the body
Enter RICHARD and SOMERSET to fight SOMERSET is killed
RICHARD So lie thou there
The Castle in Saint Albans Somerset
Hath made the wizard famous in his death
Sword hold thy temper heart be wrathful still
Priests pray for enemies but princes kill             Exit
Fight Excursions Enter KING QUEEN and others
QUEEN Away my lord You are slow for shame away
KING HENRY Can we outrun the heavens Good Margaret stay
Now is it manhood wisdom and defence
To give the enemy way and to secure us
By what we can which can no more but fly
And where this breach now in our fortunes made
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly
But fly you must uncurable discomfit
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts
Away for your relief and we will live
To see their day and them our fortune give
Away my lord away                                  Exeunt
SCENE III
Fields near Saint Albans
Alarum Retreat Enter YORK RICHARD WARWICK and soldiers
with drum and colours
YORK Of Salisbury who can report of him
That winter lion who in rage forgets
Aged contusions and all brush of time
And like a gallant in the brow of youth
Repairs him with occasion This happy day
Is not itself nor have we won one foot
If Salisbury be lost
RICHARD My noble father
Three times bestrid him thrice I led him off
Persuaded him from any further act
But still where danger was still there I met him
And like rich hangings in a homely house
So was his will in his old feeble body
But noble as he is look where he comes
Enter SALISBURY
God knows how long it is I have to live
You have defended me from imminent death
Well lords we have not got that which we have
Being opposites of such repairing nature
YORK I know our safety is to follow them
For as I hear the King is fled to London
To call a present court of Parliament
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth
What says Lord Warwick Shall we after them
WARWICK After them Nay before them if we can
Sound drum and trumpets and to London all
And more such days as these to us befall             Exeunt

SCENE
England and France
ACT I SCENE I
London The Parliament House
Alarum Enter DUKE OF YORK EDWARD RICHARD NORFOLK MONTAGUE WARWICK
and soldiers with white roses in their hats
He slily stole away and left his men
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain
Is either slain or wounded dangerous
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow
That this is true father behold his blood
RICHARD Speak thou for me and tell them what I did
But is your Grace dead my Lord of Somerset
NORFOLK Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt
WARWICK And so do I Victorious Prince of York
Before I see thee seated in that throne
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
This is the palace of the fearful King
And this the regal seat Possess it York
YORK Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will
For hither we have broken in by force
YORK Thanks gentle Norfolk Stay by me my lords
And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
WARWICK And when the King comes offer him no violence
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
YORK The Queen this day here holds her parliament
But little thinks we shall be of her council
By words or blows here let us win our right
Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be King
YORK Then leave me not my lords be resolute
I mean to take possession of my right
WARWICK Neither the King nor he that loves him best
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster
Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells
Resolve thee Richard claim the English crown
Flourish Enter KING HENRY CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND
WESTMORELAND EXETER and others with red roses in
their hats
KING HENRY My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
Even in the chair of state Belike he means
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king
Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father
On him his sons his favourites and his friends
CLIFFORD The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel
My heart for anger burns I cannot brook it
KING HENRY Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland
CLIFFORD Patience is for poltroons such as he
My gracious lord here in the parliament
Let us assail the family of York
NORTHUMBERLAND Well hast thou spoken cousin be it so
KING HENRY Ah know you not the city favours them
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck
To make a shambles of the parliament house
Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use
Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
I am thy sovereign
YORK I am thine
EXETER For shame come down he made thee Duke of York
EXETER Thy father was a traitor to the crown
WARWICK Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry
CLIFFORD Whom should he follow but his natural king
KING HENRY And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne
YORK It must and shall be so content thyself
WARWICK Be Duke of Lancaster let him be King
WESTMORELAND He is both King and Duke of Lancaster
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain
WARWICK And Warwick shall disprove it You forget
And slew your fathers and with colours spread
NORTHUMBERLAND Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief
And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
WESTMORELAND Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
CLIFFORD Urge it no more lest that instead of words
I send thee Warwick such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir
WARWICK Poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats
YORK Will you we show our title to the crown
If not our swords shall plead it in the field
KING HENRY What title hast thou traitor to the crown
Thy father was as thou art Duke of York
Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March
I am the son of Henry the Fifth
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
WARWICK Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all
KING HENRY The Lord Protector lost it and not I
RICHARD You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
EDWARD Sweet father do so set it on your head
RICHARD Sound drums and trumpets and the King will fly
YORK Sons peace
KING HENRY Peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak
WARWICK Plantagenet shall speak first Hear him lords
And be you silent and attentive too
For he that interrupts him shall not live
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat
No first shall war unpeople this my realm
Ay and their colours often borne in France
WARWICK Prove it Henry and thou shalt be King
KING HENRY Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown
Tell me may not a king adopt an heir
YORK What then
KING HENRY An if he may then am I lawful King
For Richard in the view of many lords
Whose heir my father was and I am his
YORK He rose against him being his sovereign
And made him to resign his crown perforce
EXETER No for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign
KING HENRY Art thou against us Duke of Exeter
EXETER His is the right and therefore pardon me
YORK Why whisper you my lords and answer not
EXETER My conscience tells me he is lawful King
Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
Can set the Duke up in despite of me
CLIFFORD King Henry be thy title right or wrong
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence
May that ground gape and swallow me alive
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father
KING HENRY O Clifford how thy words revive my heart
YORK Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown
What mutter you or what conspire you lords
WARWICK Do right unto this princely Duke of York
Or I will fill the house with armed men
And over the chair of state where now he sits
Write up his title with usurping blood
KING HENRY My Lord of Warwick hear but one word
YORK Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
KING HENRY I am content Richard Plantagenet
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease
CLIFFORD What wrong is this unto the Prince your son
WARWICK What good is this to England and himself
WESTMORELAND Base fearful and despairing Henry
WESTMORELAND I cannot stay to hear these articles
NORTHUMBERLAND Nor I
CLIFFORD Come cousin let us tell the Queen these news
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides
NORTHUMBERLAND Be thou a prey unto the house of York
And die in bands for this unmanly deed
CLIFFORD In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND CLIFFORD
and WESTMORELAND
WARWICK Turn this way Henry and regard them not
EXETER They seek revenge and therefore will not yield
KING HENRY Ah Exeter
WARWICK Why should you sigh my lord
KING HENRY Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
Conditionally that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war and whilst I live
To honour me as thy king and sovereign
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself
YORK This oath I willingly take and will perform
WARWICK Long live King Henry Plantagenet embrace him
KING HENRY And long live thou and these thy forward sons
NORFOLK And I to Norfolk with my followers
MONTAGUE And I unto the sea from whence I came
Exeunt the YORKISTS
KING HENRY And I with grief and sorrow to the court
Enter QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE OF WALES
EXETER Here comes the Queen whose looks bewray her anger
KING HENRY Exeter so will I
QUEEN MARGARET Nay go not from me I will follow thee
KING HENRY Be patient gentle queen and I will stay
QUEEN MARGARET Who can be patient in such extremes
Ah wretched man Would I had died a maid
And never seen thee never borne thee son
Or felt that pain which I did for him once
Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son
PRINCE OF WALES Father you cannot disinherit me
If you be King why should not I succeed
KING HENRY Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son
I shame to hear thee speak Ah timorous wretch
Thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown
What is it but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time
Warwick is Chancellor and the lord of Calais
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas
The Duke is made Protector of the realm
And yet shalt thou be safe Such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves
Had I been there which am a silly woman
Before I would have granted to that act
And seeing thou dost I here divorce myself
Both from thy table Henry and thy bed
Whereby my son is disinherited
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine if once they see them spread
And spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York
KING HENRY Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak
QUEEN MARGARET Thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone
KING HENRY Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me
PRINCE OF WALES When I return with victory from the field
QUEEN MARGARET Come son away we may not linger thus
Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and the PRINCE
KING HENRY Poor queen How love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage
Whose haughty spirit winged with desire
Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son
The loss of those three lords torments my heart
Come cousin you shall be the messenger
EXETER And I I hope shall reconcile them all        Exeunt
SCENE II
Sandal Castle near Wakefield in Yorkshire
Flourish Enter EDWARD RICHARD and MONTAGUE
RICHARD Brother though I be youngest give me leave
EDWARD No I can better play the orator
MONTAGUE But I have reasons strong and forcible
Enter the DUKE OF YORK
YORK Why how now sons and brother at a strife
What is your quarrel How began it first
EDWARD No quarrel but a slight contention
YORK About what
The crown of England father which is yours
YORK Mine boy Not till King Henry be dead
RICHARD Your right depends not on his life or death
EDWARD Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now
By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe
It will outrun you father in the end
YORK I took an oath that he should quietly reign
EDWARD But for a kingdom any oath may be broken
I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
RICHARD No God forbid your Grace should be forsworn
YORK I shall be if I claim by open war
YORK Thou canst not son it is impossible
RICHARD An oath is of no moment being not took
Before a true and lawful magistrate
That hath authority over him that swears
Henry had none but did usurp the place
Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
Therefore to arms And father do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy
Why do we linger thus I cannot rest
YORK Richard enough I will be King or die
Brother thou shalt to London presently
And whet on Warwick to this enterprise
Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk
And tell him privily of our intent
You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise
In them I trust for they are soldiers
Witty courteous liberal full of spirit
But that I seek occasion how to rise
And yet the King not privy to my drift
Nor any of the house of Lancaster
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
Intend here to besiege you in your castle
She is hard by with twenty thousand men
And therefore fortify your hold my lord
Edward and Richard you shall stay with me
My brother Montague shall post to London
Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest
Whom we have left protectors of the King
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths
And thus most humbly I do take my leave                Exit
Enter SIR JOHN and SIR HUGH MORTIMER
YORK Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles
You are come to Sandal in a happy hour
The army of the Queen mean to besiege us
YORK What with five thousand men
RICHARD Ay with five hundred father for a need
And issue forth and bid them battle straight
YORK Five men to twenty Though the odds be great
I doubt not uncle of our victory
Many a battle have I won in France
When as the enemy hath been ten to one
Why should I not now have the like success           Exeunt
SCENE III
Field of battle between Sandal Castle and Wakefield
Alarum Enter RUTLAND and his TUTOR
RUTLAND Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands
Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes
Enter CLIFFORD and soldiers
CLIFFORD Chaplain away Thy priesthood saves thy life
As for the brat of this accursed duke
Whose father slew my father he shall die
TUTOR And I my lord will bear him company
CLIFFORD Soldiers away with him
TUTOR Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child
Lest thou be hated both of God and man
Exit forced off by soldiers
CLIFFORD How now is he dead already Or is it fear
That trembles under his devouring paws
And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword
Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath
He is a man and Clifford cope with him
CLIFFORD Had I thy brethren here their lives and thine
Were not revenge sufficient for me
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains
It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
The sight of any of the house of York
Is as a fury to torment my soul
And till I root out their accursed line
And leave not one alive I live in hell
RUTLAND O let me pray before I take my death
To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me
RUTLAND I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me
CLIFFORD Thy father hath
Thou hast one son for his sake pity me
Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just
He be as miserably slain as I
Ah let me live in prison all my days
And when I give occasion of offence
Then let me die for now thou hast no cause
CLIFFORD No cause
CLIFFORD Plantagenet I come Plantagenet
Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
SCENE IV
Another part of the field
Alarum Enter the DUKE OF YORK
YORK The army of the Queen hath got the field
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly like ships before the wind
Like men born to renown by life or death
Three times did Richard make a lane to me
And full as oft came Edward to my side
With purple falchion painted to the hilt
And when the hardiest warriors did retire
With bootless labour swim against the tide
Ah hark The fatal followers do pursue
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury
And were I strong I would not shun their fury
Here must I stay and here my life must end
Enter QUEEN MARGARET CLIFFORD NORTHUMBERLAND
the PRINCE OF WALES and soldiers
Come bloody Clifford rough Northumberland
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage
I am your butt and I abide your shot
NORTHUMBERLAND Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet
CLIFFORD Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car
And made an evening at the noontide prick
YORK My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
A bird that will revenge upon you all
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven
Why come you not What multitudes and fear
CLIFFORD So cowards fight when they can fly no further
So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
YORK O Clifford but bethink thee once again
And if thou canst for blushing view this face
And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
CLIFFORD I will not bandy with thee word for word
But buckler with thee blows twice two for one
QUEEN MARGARET Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes
Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland
NORTHUMBERLAND Hold Clifford do not honour him so much
To prick thy finger though to wound his heart
What valour were it when a cur doth grin
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth
When he might spurn him with his foot away
And ten to one is no impeach of valour
CLIFFORD Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
NORTHUMBERLAND So doth the cony struggle in the net
NORTHUMBERLAND What would your Grace have done unto him now
QUEEN MARGARET Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland
Come make him stand upon this molehill here
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand
And made a preachment of your high descent
Where are your mess of sons to back you now
The wanton Edward and the lusty George
Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland
Made issue from the bosom of the boy
And if thine eyes can water for his death
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly
I should lament thy miserable state
I prithee grieve to make me merry York
Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad
And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus
Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance
York cannot speak unless he wear a crown
Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on
Ay marry sir now looks he like a king
And this is he was his adopted heir
But how is it that great Plantagenet
As I bethink me you should not be King
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death
And rob his temples of the diadem
Now in his life against your holy oath
Off with the crown and with the crown his head
And whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
To triumph like an Amazonian trull
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates
Made impudent with use of evil deeds
I would assay proud queen to make thee blush
Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
Unless the adage must be verified
That beggars mounted run their horse to death
But God He knows thy share thereof is small
The want thereof makes thee abominable
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us
Or as the south to the septentrion
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal
Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will
For raging wind blows up incessant showers
And when the rage allays the rain begins
And every drop cries vengeance for his death
NORTHUMBERLAND Beshrew me but his passions move me so
That hardly can I check my eyes from tears
YORK That face of his the hungry cannibals
And I with tears do wash the blood away
Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this
Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
There take the crown and with the crown my curse
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand
My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
I should not for my life but weep with him
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
Think but upon the wrong he did us all
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears
YORK Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God
My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee
QUEEN MARGARET Off with his head and set it on York gates
So York may overlook the town of York
Flourish Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
A march Enter EDWARD RICHARD and their power
Had he been slain we should have heard the news
The happy tidings of his good escape
How fares my brother Why is he so sad
Where our right valiant father is become
I saw him in the battle range about
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat
The rest stand all aloof and bark at him
So fled his enemies my warlike father
See how the morning opes her golden gates
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun
How well resembles it the prime of youth
EDWARD Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns
RICHARD Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
Not separated with the racking clouds
See see they join embrace and seem to kiss
Now are they but one lamp one light one sun
In this the heaven figures some event
I think it cites us brother to the field
That we the sons of brave Plantagenet
Each one already blazing by our meeds
Should notwithstanding join our lights together
And overshine the earth as this the world
Upon my target three fair shining suns
You love the breeder better than the male
Enter a MESSENGER blowing
But what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
When as the noble Duke of York was slain
Your princely father and my loving lord
EDWARD O speak no more for I have heard too much
RICHARD Say how he died for I will hear it all
MESSENGER Environed he was with many foes
And stood against them as the hope of Troy
But Hercules himself must yield to odds
And many strokes though with a little axe
Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen
The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain
And after many scorns many foul taunts
They took his head and on the gates of York
They set the same and there it doth remain
EDWARD Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon
Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
Ah would she break from hence that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest
For never henceforth shall I joy again
Never O never shall I see more joy
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench
To weep is to make less the depth of grief
Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
Or die renowned by attempting it
EDWARD His name that valiant duke hath left with thee
His dukedom and his chair with me is left
For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
Either that is thine or else thou wert not his
March Enter WARWICK MONTAGUE and their army
WARWICK How now fair lords What fare What news abroad
RICHARD Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount
Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told
The words would add more anguish than the wounds
O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain
EDWARD O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death
And now to add more measure to your woes
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought
Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
Were brought me of your loss and his depart
I then in London keeper of the King
And very well appointed as I thought
Bearing the King in my behalf along
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Who thunders to his captives blood and death
I cannot judge but to conclude with truth
Their weapons like to lightning came and went
Or like an idle thresher with a flail
Fell gently down as if they struck their friends
With promise of high pay and great rewards
But all in vain they had no heart to fight
And we in them no hope to win the day
So that we fled the King unto the Queen
Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself
For in the marches here we heard you were
Making another head to fight again
EDWARD Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick
And when came George from Burgundy to England
WARWICK Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers
And for your brother he was lately sent
From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy
With aid of soldiers to this needful war
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit
WARWICK Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist
Were he as famous and as bold in war
RICHARD I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms
WARWICK Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out
And therefore comes my brother Montague
Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland
And of their feather many moe proud birds
He swore consent to your succession
His oath enrolled in the parliament
And now to London all the crew are gone
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster
Their power I think is thirty thousand strong
Now if the help of Norfolk and myself
With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand
Why Via to London will we march amain
And once again bestride our foaming steeds
But never once again turn back and fly
RICHARD Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak
EDWARD Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean
Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend
WARWICK No longer Earl of March but Duke of York
In every borough as we pass along
And he that throws not up his cap for joy
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
King Edward valiant Richard Montague
Stay we no longer dreaming of renown
But sound the trumpets and about our task
RICHARD Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
I come to pierce it or to give thee mine
EDWARD Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us
Enter a MESSENGER
WARWICK How now what news
MESSENGER The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
The Queen is coming with a puissant host
And craves your company for speedy counsel
Exeunt
SCENE II
Before York
Flourish Enter KING HENRY QUEEN MARGARET the PRINCE OF WALES CLIFFORD
NORTHUMBERLAND with drum and trumpets
QUEEN MARGARET Welcome my lord to this brave town of York
Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
To see this sight it irks my very soul
CLIFFORD My gracious liege this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks
Not to the beast that would usurp their den
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
Not his that spoils her young before her face
Not he that sets his foot upon her back
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
Ambitious York did level at thy crown
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows
He but a Duke would have his son a king
And raise his issue like a loving sire
Didst yield consent to disinherit him
Which argued thee a most unloving father
Unreasonable creatures feed their young
Yet in protection of their tender ones
For shame my liege make them your precedent
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
And long hereafter say unto his child
Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy
And let his manly face which promiseth
Successful fortune steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him
Inferring arguments of mighty force
But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear
That things ill got had ever bad success
And happy always was it for that son
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell
And would my father had left me no more
For all the rest is held at such a rate
Than in possession any jot of pleasure
Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here
QUEEN MARGARET My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh
And this soft courage makes your followers faint
Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
Edward kneel down
KING HENRY Edward Plantagenet arise a knight
And learn this lesson Draw thy sword in right
PRINCE OF WALES My gracious father by your kingly leave
And in that quarrel use it to the death
CLIFFORD Why that is spoken like a toward prince
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Royal commanders be in readiness
For with a band of thirty thousand men
Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York
And in the towns as they do march along
Proclaims him king and many fly to him
Darraign your battle for they are at hand
CLIFFORD I would your Highness would depart the field
The Queen hath best success when you are absent
QUEEN MARGARET Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
NORTHUMBERLAND Be it with resolution then to fight
PRINCE OF WALES My royal father cheer these noble lords
And hearten those that fight in your defence
March Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD WARWICK
NORFOLK MONTAGUE and soldiers
And set thy diadem upon my head
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field
QUEEN MARGARET Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
EDWARD I am his king and he should bow his knee
I was adopted heir by his consent
Since when his oath is broke for as I hear
You that are King though he do wear the crown
To blot out me and put his own son in
CLIFFORD And reason too
Who should succeed the father but the son
RICHARD Are you there butcher O I cannot speak
Or any he the proudest of thy sort
CLIFFORD Ay and old York and yet not satisfied
When you and I met at Saint Albans last
Your legs did better service than your hands
CLIFFORD You said so much before and yet you fled
NORTHUMBERLAND No nor your manhood that durst make you stay
RICHARD Northumberland I hold thee reverently
Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain
RICHARD Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland
KING HENRY Have done with words my lords and hear me speak
QUEEN MARGARET Defy them then or else hold close thy lips
KING HENRY I prithee give no limits to my tongue
CLIFFORD My liege the wound that bred this meeting here
RICHARD Then executioner unsheathe thy sword
EDWARD Say Henry shall I have my right or no
WARWICK If thou deny their blood upon thy head
For York in justice puts his armour on
PRINCE OF WALES If that be right which Warwick says is right
There is no wrong but every thing is right
RICHARD Whoever got thee there thy mother stands
QUEEN MARGARET But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
But like a foul misshapen stigmatic
RICHARD Iron of Naples hid with English gilt
EDWARD A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
To make this shameless callet know herself
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou
Although thy husband may be Menelaus
By that false woman as this king by thee
He might have kept that glory to this day
But when he took a beggar to his bed
Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
And we in pity of the gentle King
GEORGE But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
And that thy summer bred us no increase
We set the axe to thy usurping root
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves
Yet know thou since we have begun to strike
EDWARD And in this resolution I defy thee
Not willing any longer conference
Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak
Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
And either victory or else a grave
QUEEN MARGARET Stay Edward
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day
Exeunt
SCENE III
A field of battle between Towton and Saxton in Yorkshire
Alarum excursions Enter WARWICK
WARWICK Forspent with toil as runners with a race
I lay me down a little while to breathe
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile
Enter EDWARD running
EDWARD Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
WARWICK How now my lord What hap What hope of good
Enter GEORGE
GEORGE Our hap is lost our hope but sad despair
Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us
What counsel give you Whither shall we fly
EDWARD Bootless is flight they follow us with wings
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
Enter RICHARD
RICHARD Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
And in the very pangs of death he cried
Like to a dismal clangor heard from far
So underneath the belly of their steeds
The noble gentleman gave up the ghost
WARWICK Then let the earth be drunken with our blood
Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
And look upon as if the tragedy
Here on my knee I vow to God above
Or fortune given me measure of revenge
EDWARD O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine
I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee
Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands
That to my foes this body must be prey
Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul
Now lords take leave until we meet again
RICHARD Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms
I that did never weep now melt with woe
WARWICK Away away Once more sweet lords farewell
GEORGE Yet let us all together to our troops
And give them leave to fly that will not stay
And call them pillars that will stand to us
And if we thrive promise them such rewards
As victors wear at the Olympian games
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts
For yet is hope of life and victory
Forslow no longer make we hence amain               Exeunt
SCENE IV
Another part of the field
Excursions Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD
RICHARD Now Clifford I have singled thee alone
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York
And this for Rutland both bound to revenge
CLIFFORD Now Richard I am with thee here alone
This is the hand that stabbed thy father York
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself
Enter WARWICK CLIFFORD flies
RICHARD Nay Warwick single out some other chase
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death            Exeunt
SCENE V
Another part of the field
Alarum Enter KING HENRY alone
When dying clouds contend with growing light
What time the shepherd blowing of his nails
Can neither call it perfect day nor night
Now sways it this way like a mighty sea
Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
Now one the better then another best
Both tugging to be victors breast to breast
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered
So is the equal poise of this fell war
Here on this molehill will I sit me down
To whom God will there be the victory
For Margaret my queen and Clifford too
Have chid me from the battle swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence
For what is in this world but grief and woe
O God methinks it were a happy life
To be no better than a homely swain
To sit upon a hill as I do now
To carve out dials quaintly point by point
How many makes the hour full complete
How many hours brings about the day
How many days will finish up the year
How many years a mortal man may live
So many hours must I tend my flock
So many hours must I take my rest
So many hours must I contemplate
So many hours must I sport myself
So many days my ewes have been with young
So many weeks ere the poor fools will can
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece
So minutes hours days months and years
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys
His viands sparkling in a golden cup
His body couched in a curious bed
When care mistrust and treason waits on him
another door
SON Ill blows the wind that profits nobody
This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
May be possessed with some store of crowns
And I that haply take them from him now
May yet ere night yield both my life and them
To some man else as this dead man doth me
O heavy times begetting such events
Have by my hands of life bereaved him
Pardon me God I knew not what I did
And pardon father for I knew not thee
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
KING HENRY O piteous spectacle O bloody times
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
And let our hearts and eyes like civil war
Enter FATHER bearing of his SON
FATHER Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me
Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold
For I have bought it with an hundred blows
Ah no no no no it is mine only son
Ah boy if any life be left in thee
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
Upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart
O pity God this miserable age
What stratagems how fell how butcherly
Erroneous mutinous and unnatural
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget
O boy thy father gave thee life too soon
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late
KING HENRY Woe above woe grief more than common grief
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
O pity pity gentle heaven pity
The red rose and the white are on his face
The fatal colours of our striving houses
The one his purple blood right well resembles
The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth
Wither one rose and let the other flourish
If you contend a thousand lives must perish
FATHER How will my wife for slaughter of my son
KING HENRY How will the country for these woeful chances
Misthink the King and not be satisfied
Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
Exit with the body
My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
And so obsequious will thy father be
Even for the loss of thee having no more
As Priam was for all his valiant sons
For I have murdered where I should not kill
Exit with the body
Here sits a king more woeful than you are
Alarums excursions Enter QUEEN MARGARET
PRINCE OF WALES and EXETER
PRINCE OF WALES Fly father fly for all your friends are fled
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull
Away for death doth hold us in pursuit
QUEEN MARGARET Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain
Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds
Having the fearful flying hare in sight
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
Are at our backs and therefore hence amain
EXETER Away for vengeance comes along with them
Nay stay not to expostulate make speed
KING HENRY Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter
Not that I fear to stay but love to go
Whither the Queen intends Forward away             Exeunt
SCENE VI
Another part of the field
A loud alarum Enter CLIFFORD wounded
CLIFFORD Here burns my candle out ay here it dies
Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light
O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow
And now I fall thy tough commixture melts
The common people swarm like summer flies
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun
O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent
That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds
Or as thy father and his father did
Giving no ground unto the house of York
They never then had sprung like summer flies
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight
The foe is merciless and will not pity
The air hath got into my deadly wounds
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint
Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest
Alarum and retreat Enter EDWARD GEORGE RICHARD
MONTAGUE WARWICK and soldiers
EDWARD Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
That led calm Henry though he were a king
Command an argosy to stern the waves
But think you lords that Clifford fled with them
For though before his face I speak the words
RICHARD Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
See who it is
If friend or foe let him be gently used
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth
I mean our princely father Duke of York
WARWICK From off the gates of York fetch down the head
Instead whereof let this supply the room
Measure for measure must be answered
That nothing sung but death to us and ours
WARWICK I think his understanding is bereft
Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say
RICHARD O would he did and so perhaps he doth
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
Which in the time of death he gave our father
RICHARD Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
EDWARD Clifford repent in bootless penitence
WARWICK Clifford devise excuses for thy faults
GEORGE While we devise fell tortures for thy faults
RICHARD Thou didst love York and I am son to York
WARWICK They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wont
RICHARD What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
That I in all despite might rail at him
This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
York and young Rutland could not satisfy
And now to London with triumphant march
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together
And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
First will I see the coronation
To effect this marriage so it please my lord
EDWARD Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat
And never will I undertake the thing
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester
And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
RICHARD Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester
Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London
To see these honours in possession                   Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
A chase in the north of England
For through this laund anon the deer will come
And in this covert will we make our stand
Culling the principal of all the deer
Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
Here stand we both and aim we at the best
And for the time shall not seem tedious
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now
No humble suitors press to speak for right
No not a man comes for redress of thee
For how can I help them and not myself
KING HENRY Let me embrace thee sour adversity
For wise men say it is the wisest course
SECOND KEEPER Why linger we let us lay hands upon him
KING HENRY My Queen and son are gone to France for aid
And as I hear the great commanding Warwick
To wife for Edward If this news be true
Poor queen and son your labour is but lost
For Warwick is a subtle orator
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words
By this account then Margaret may win him
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
And Nero will be tainted with remorse
To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
She on his left side craving aid for Henry
He on his right asking a wife for Edward
That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength
And in conclusion wins the King from her
With promise of his sister and what else
KING HENRY More than I seem and less than I was born to
A man at least for less I should not be
And men may talk of kings and why not I
SECOND KEEPER But if thou be a king where is thy crown
KING HENRY My crown is in my heart not on my head
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us for as we think
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy
KING HENRY But did you never swear and break an oath
SECOND KEEPER No never such an oath nor will not now
KING HENRY Where did you dwell when I was King of England
SECOND KEEPER Here in this country where we now remain
KING HENRY I was anointed king at nine months old
My father and my grandfather were kings
And you were sworn true subjects unto me
And tell me then have you not broke your oaths
FIRST KEEPER No
For we were subjects but while you were king
KING HENRY Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man
Ah simple men you know not what you swear
Look as I blow this feather from my face
And as the air blows it to me again
Obeying with my wind when I do blow
And yielding to another when it blows
Commanded always by the greater gust
Such is the lightness of you common men
But do not break your oaths for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
Go where you will the King shall be commanded
FIRST KEEPER We are true subjects to the King King Edward
KING HENRY So would you be again to Henry
If he were seated as King Edward is
To go with us unto the officers
And what God will that let your King perform
And what he will I humbly yield unto                Exeunt

SCENE II
London The palace
Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and LADY GREY
Her suit is now to repossess those lands
Which we in justice cannot well deny
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life
GLOUCESTER Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit
It were dishonour to deny it her
I see the lady hath a thing to grant
Before the King will grant her humble suit
keeps the wind
KING EDWARD Widow we will consider of your suit
And come some other time to know our mind
LADY GREY Right gracious lord I cannot brook delay
May it please your Highness to resolve me now
And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
lands
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you
to fall
vantages
KING EDWARD How many children hast thou widow tell me
her
give her two
LADY GREY Three my most gracious lord
LADY GREY Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
leave
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch
KING EDWARD Now tell me madam do you love your children
LADY GREY Ay full as dearly as I love myself
KING EDWARD And would you not do much to do them good
LADY GREY To do them good I would sustain some harm
LADY GREY Therefore I came unto your Majesty
KING EDWARD What service wilt thou do me if I give them
LADY GREY What you command that rests in me to do
KING EDWARD But you will take exceptions to my boon
LADY GREY No gracious lord except I cannot do it
KING EDWARD Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask
LADY GREY Why then I will do what your Grace commands
GLOUCESTER He plies her hard and much rain wears the marble
CLARENCE As red as fire Nay then her wax must melt
LADY GREY Why stops my lord Shall I not hear my task
LADY GREY I take my leave with many thousand thanks
GLOUCESTER The match is made she seals it with a curtsy
LADY GREY The fruits of love I mean my loving liege
KING EDWARD Ay but I fear me in another sense
What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get
LADY GREY My love till death my humble thanks my prayers
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants
KING EDWARD No by my troth I did not mean such love
LADY GREY Why then you mean not as I thought you did
KING EDWARD But now you partly may perceive my mind
LADY GREY My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your Highness aims at if I aim aright
KING EDWARD To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee
LADY GREY To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison
LADY GREY Why then mine honesty shall be my dower
For by that loss I will not purchase them
LADY GREY Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me
But mighty lord this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit
Please you dismiss me either with ay or no
KING EDWARD Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
No if thou dost say no to my demand
LADY GREY Then no my lord My suit is at an end
GLOUCESTER The widow likes him not she knits her brows
CLARENCE He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom
Her words doth show her wit incomparable
All her perfections challenge sovereignty
One way or other she is for a king
And she shall be my love or else my queen
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen
I am a subject fit to jest withal
But far unfit to be a sovereign
KING EDWARD Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends
And that is to enjoy thee for my love
LADY GREY And that is more than I will yield unto
I know I am too mean to be your queen
And yet too good to be your concubine
KING EDWARD You cavil widow I did mean my queen
KING EDWARDNo more than when my daughters call thee mother
Thou art a widow and thou hast some children
To be the father unto many sons
Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
GLOUCESTER The ghostly father now hath done his shrift
KING EDWARD Brothers you muse what chat we two have had
GLOUCESTER The widow likes it not for she looks very sad
CLARENCE To who my lord
KING EDWARD Why Clarence to myself
GLOUCESTER By so much is the wonder in extremes
KING EDWARD Well jest on brothers I can tell you both
Enter a NOBLEMAN
NOBLEMAN My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate
And go we brothers to the man that took him
To question of his apprehension
Widow go you along Lords use her honourably
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER Ay Edward will use women honourably
Would he were wasted marrow bones and all
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
To cross me from the golden time I look for
Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward
To take their rooms ere I can place myself
A cold premeditation for my purpose
Why then I do but dream on sovereignty
Like one that stands upon a promontory
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence
So do I wish the crown being so far off
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it
Flattering me with impossibilities
Unless my hand and strength could equal them
Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard
What other pleasure can the world afford
And deck my body in gay ornaments
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
O miserable thought and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
And for I should not deal in her soft laws
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
To make an envious mountain on my back
Where sits deformity to mock my body
To shape my legs of an unequal size
To disproportion me in every part
That carries no impression like the dam
O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
Then since this earth affords no joy to me
As are of better person than myself
Be round impaled with a glorious crown
And yet I know not how to get the crown
For many lives stand between me and home
That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns
Seeking a way and straying from the way
Not knowing how to find the open air
Torment myself to catch the English crown
And from that torment I will free myself
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe
Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears
And frame my face to all occasions
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could
And like a Sinon take another Troy
I can add colours to the chameleon
Change shapes with Protheus for advantages
And set the murderous Machiavel to school
Can I do this and cannot get a crown
SCENE III
Flourish  Enter LEWIS the French King his sister BONA
and the EARL of OXFORD  LEWIS sits and riseth up again
LEWIS Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret
Sit down with us It ill befits thy state
And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit
QUEEN MARGARET No mighty King of France Now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
Where kings command I was I must confess
But now mischance hath trod my title down
And with dishonour laid me on the ground
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune
And to my humble seat conform myself
LEWIS Why say fair Queen whence springs this deep despair
QUEEN MARGARET From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
Still ride in triumph over all mischance
Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief
QUEEN MARGARET Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis
That Henry sole possessor of my love
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
This is the cause that I poor Margaret
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
And if thou fail us all our hope is done
Scotland hath will to help but cannot help
Our people and our peers are both misled
And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
LEWIS Renowned Queen with patience calm the storm
While we bethink a means to break it off
QUEEN MARGARET The more we stay the stronger grows our foe
QUEEN MARGARET O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
Enter WARWICK
LEWIS Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France
QUEEN MARGARET Ay now begins a second storm to rise
For this is he that moves both wind and tide
WARWICK From worthy Edward King of Albion
My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
I come in kindness and unfeigned love
First to do greetings to thy royal person
And then to crave a league of amity
And lastly to confirm that amity
With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister
I am commanded with your leave and favour
Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue
QUEEN MARGARET King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak
Before you answer Warwick His demand
But from deceit bred by necessity
For how can tyrants safely govern home
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
That Henry liveth still but were he dead
Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
For though usurpers sway the rule a while
WARWICK Injurious Margaret
PRINCE OF WALES And why not Queen
WARWICK Because thy father Henry did usurp
And thou no more art prince than she is queen
OXFORD Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain
And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth
Who by his prowess conquered all France
From these our Henry lineally descends
WARWICK Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that
But for the rest you tell a pedigree
OXFORD Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
And not betray thy treason with a blush
WARWICK Can Oxford that did ever fence the right
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king
OXFORD Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere
Was done to death and more than so my father
When nature brought him to the door of death
No Warwick no while life upholds this arm
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster
WARWICK And I the house of York
LEWIS Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford
Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
While I use further conference with Warwick
LEWIS Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
Is Edward your true king for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen
WARWICK Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour
WARWICK The more that Henry was unfortunate
LEWIS Then further all dissembling set aside
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona
WARWICK Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant
Exempt from envy but not from disdain
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain
LEWIS Now sister let us hear your firm resolve
BONA Your grant or your denial shall be mine
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make
Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king
PRINCE OF WALES To Edward but not to the English king
QUEEN MARGARET Deceitful Warwick it was thy device
By this alliance to make void my suit
LEWIS And still is friend to him and Margaret
But if your title to the crown be weak
From giving aid which late I promised
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
That your estate requires and mine can yield
WARWICK Henry now lives in Scotland at his case
Where having nothing nothing can he lose
And as for you yourself our quondam queen
You have a father able to maintain you
QUEEN MARGARET Peace impudent and shameless Warwick
Proud setter up and puller down of kings
I will not hence till with my talk and tears
Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold
LEWIS Warwick this is some post to us or thee
Enter the POST
POST My lord ambassador these letters are for you
Sent from your brother Marquis Montague
These from our King unto your Majesty
And madam these for you from whom I know not
OXFORD I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress
Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his
PRINCE OF WALES Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled
LEWIS Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen
LEWIS What has your king married the Lady Grey
And now to soothe your forgery and his
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
QUEEN MARGARET I told your Majesty as much before
WARWICK King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss
No more my king for he dishonours me
But most himself if he could see his shame
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death
Did I impale him with the regal crown
Did I put Henry from his native right
Shame on himself for my desert is honour
And to repair my honour lost for him
I here renounce him and return to Henry
My noble Queen let former grudges pass
And henceforth I am thy true servitor
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona
And replant Henry in his former state
And I forgive and quite forget old faults
WARWICK So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers
And force the tyrant from his seat by war
And as for Clarence as my letters tell me
For matching more for wanton lust than honour
Or than for strength and safety of our country
But by thy help to this distressed queen
QUEEN MARGARET Renowned Prince how shall poor Henry live
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair
WARWICK And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours
You shall have aid
QUEEN MARGARET Let me give humble thanks for all at once
And tell false Edward thy supposed king
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
To revel it with him and his new bride
QUEEN MARGARET Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
And I am ready to put armour on
WARWICK Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
LEWIS But Warwick
Thou and Oxford with five thousand men
Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle
And as occasion serves this noble Queen
And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply
Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
WARWICK This shall assure my constant loyalty
That if our Queen and this young Prince agree
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
QUEEN MARGARET Yes I agree and thank you for your motion
Son Edward she is fair and virtuous
And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
PRINCE OF WALES Yes I accept her for she well deserves it
And here to pledge my vow I give my hand
LEWIS stay we now These soldiers shall be levied
And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral
Shall waft them over with our royal fleet
For mocking marriage with a dame of France
Exeunt all but WARWICK
WARWICK I came from Edward as ambassador
But I return his sworn and mortal foe
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
But dreadful war shall answer his demand
Had he none else to make a stale but me
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow

ACT IV SCENE I
London The palace
Enter GLOUCESTER CLARENCE SOMERSET and MONTAGUE
GLOUCESTER Now tell me brother Clarence what think you
Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey
Hath not our brother made a worthy choice
How could he stay till Warwick made return
SOMERSET My lords forbear this talk here comes the King
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD attended LADY
GREY as Queen PEMBROKE STAFFORD HASTINGS
and others Four stand on one side and four on the other
CLARENCE I mind to tell him plainly what I think
KING EDWARD Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice
That you stand pensive as half malcontent
CLARENCE As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
KING EDWARD Suppose they take offence without a cause
They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward
GLOUCESTER And shall have your will because our King
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
KING EDWARD Yea brother Richard are you offended too
GLOUCESTER Not I
To sunder them that yoke so well together
KING EDWARD Setting your scorns and your mislike aside
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
And you too Somerset and Montague
Speak freely what you think
CLARENCE Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis
Becomes your enemy for mocking him
About the marriage of the Lady Bona
GLOUCESTER And Warwick doing what you gave in charge
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage
By such invention as I can devise
HASTINGS Why knows not Montague that of itself
England is safe if true within itself
And with their helps only defend ourselves
In them and in ourselves our safety lies
CLARENCE For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford
KING EDWARD Ay what of that it was my will and grant
And for this once my will shall stand for law
GLOUCESTER And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
Unto the brother of your loving bride
She better would have fitted me or Clarence
But in your bride you bury brotherhood
And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
KING EDWARD Alas poor Clarence Is it for a wife
That thou art malcontent I will provide thee
Which being shallow you shall give me leave
To play the broker in mine own behalf
And to that end I shortly mind to leave you
KING EDWARD Leave me or tarry Edward will be King
To raise my state to title of a queen
Do me but right and you must all confess
That I was not ignoble of descent
And meaner than myself have had like fortune
But as this title honours me and mine
So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing
Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
KING EDWARD My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns
What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
So long as Edward is thy constant friend
And their true sovereign whom they must obey
Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
Unless they seek for hatred at my hands
Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe
And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
Enter a POST
KING EDWARD Now messenger what letters or what news
From France
MESSENGER My sovereign liege no letters and few words
But such as I without your special pardon
Dare not relate
KING EDWARD Go to we pardon thee therefore in brief
Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters
MESSENGER At my depart these were his very words
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
KING EDWARD IS Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry
But what said Lady Bona to my marriage
KING EDWARD I blame not her she could say little less
For I have heard that she was there in place
KING EDWARD Belike she minds to play the Amazon
But what said Warwick to these injuries
KING EDWARD Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
They shall have wars and pay for their presumption
But say is Warwick friends with Margaret
CLARENCE Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger
Now brother king farewell and sit you fast
That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage
I may not prove inferior to yourself
You that love me and Warwick follow me
Exit and SOMERSET follows
My thoughts aim at a further matter I
Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown
KING EDWARD Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick
Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf
Go levy men and make prepare for war
They are already or quickly will be landed
Myself in person will straight follow you
Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD
But ere I go Hastings and Montague
Resolve my doubt You twain of all the rest
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me
If it be so then both depart to him
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends
But if you mind to hold your true obedience
Give me assurance with some friendly vow
That I may never have you in suspect
MONTAGUE So God help Montague as he proves true
KING EDWARD Now brother Richard will you stand by us
GLOUCESTER Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
KING EDWARD Why so then am I sure of victory
Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
SCENE II
A plain in Warwickshire
Enter WARWICK and OXFORD with French soldiers
WARWICK Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
The common people by numbers swarm to us
Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET
But see where Somerset and Clarence comes
CLARENCE Fear not that my lord
WARWICK Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick
And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice
To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings
But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine
His soldiers lurking in the towns about
And but attended by a simple guard
We may surprise and take him at our pleasure
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy
That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds
For I intend but only to surprise him
You that will follow me to this attempt
Applaud the name of Henry with your leader
For Warwick and his friends God and Saint George    Exeunt
SCENE III
FIRST WATCHMAN Come on my masters each man take his stand
The King by this is set him down to sleep
SECOND WATCHMAN What will he not to bed
FIRST WATCHMAN Why no for he hath made a solemn vow
Never to lie and take his natural rest
If Warwick be so near as men report
THIRD WATCHMAN But say I pray what nobleman is that
That with the King here resteth in his tent
THIRD WATCHMAN O is it So But why commands the King
That his chief followers lodge in towns about him
While he himself keeps in the cold field
THIRD WATCHMAN Ay but give me worship and quietness
I like it better than dangerous honour
If Warwick knew in what estate he stands
FIRST WATCHMAN Unless our halberds did shut up his passage
SECOND WATCHMAN Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
Enter WARWICK CLARENCE OXFORD SOMERSET
and French soldiers silent all
WARWICK This is his tent and see where stand his guard
Courage my masters Honour now or never
But follow me and Edward shall be ours
FIRST WATCHMAN Who goes there
SECOND WATCHMAN Stay or thou diest
and the rest following them
and the rest bringing the KING out in his gown
sitting in a chair GLOUCESTER and HASTINGS fly over the stage
SOMERSET What are they that fly there
WARWICK Richard and Hastings Let them go here is the Duke
KING EDWARD The Duke Why Warwick when we parted
Then I degraded you from being King
And come now to create you Duke of York
Alas how should you govern any kingdom
That know not how to use ambassadors
Nor how to be contented with one wife
Nor how to use your brothers brotherly
Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
KING EDWARD Yea brother of Clarence art thou here too
Nay then I see that Edward needs must down
Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance
Of thee thyself and all thy complices
Edward will always bear himself as King
My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
But Henry now shall wear the English crown
And be true King indeed thou but the shadow
My Lord of Somerset at my request
Unto my brother Archbishop of York
When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows
Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him
Now for a while farewell good Duke of York
KING EDWARD What fates impose that men must needs abide
It boots not to resist both wind and tide
OXFORD What now remains my lords for us to do
But march to London with our soldiers
To free King Henry from imprisonment
And see him seated in the regal throne               Exeunt
SCENE IV
London The palace
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS
RIVERS Madam what makes you in this sudden change
QUEEN ELIZABETH Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn
QUEEN ELIZABETH No but the loss of his own royal person
RIVERS Then is my sovereign slain
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
And as I further have to understand
Is new committed to the Bishop of York
RIVERS These news I must confess are full of grief
Yet gracious madam bear it as you may
Warwick may lose that now hath won the day
And I the rather wean me from despair
This is it that makes me bridle passion
Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear
Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
RIVERS But madam where is Warwick then become
There shall I rest secure from force and fraud
Come therefore let us fly while we may fly
If Warwick take us we are sure to die               Exeunt
SCENE V
A park near Middleham Castle in Yorkshire
Enter GLOUCESTER LORD HASTINGS SIR WILLIAM STANLEY and others
GLOUCESTER Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley
Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
Into this chiefest thicket of the park
Thus stands the case you know our King my brother
Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands
He hath good usage and great liberty
And often but attended with weak guard
Comes hunting this way to disport himself
That if about this hour he make this way
Under the colour of his usual game
He shall here find his friends with horse and men
To set him free from his captivity
Enter KING EDWARD and a HUNTSMAN with him
HUNTSMAN This way my lord for this way lies the game
KING EDWARD Nay this way man See where the huntsmen stand
Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest
GLOUCESTER Brother the time and case requireth haste
Your horse stands ready at the park corner
KING EDWARD But whither shall we then
HASTINGS To Lynn my lord and shipt from thence to Flanders
KING EDWARD Stanley I will requite thy forwardness
And pray that I may repossess the crown              Exeunt
SCENE VI
London The Tower
Flourish Enter KING HENRY CLARENCE WARWICK SOMERSET young HENRY
EARL OF RICHMOND OXFORD MONTAGUE LIEUTENANT OF THE TOWER and attendants
KING HENRY Master Lieutenant now that God and friends
Have shaken Edward from the regal seat
My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
At our enlargement what are thy due fees
But if an humble prayer may prevail
I then crave pardon of your Majesty
KING HENRY For what Lieutenant For well using me
For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
Conceive when after many moody thoughts
At last by notes of household harmony
They quite forget their loss of liberty
And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee
He was the author thou the instrument
By living low where fortune cannot hurt me
And that the people of this blessed land
Warwick although my head still wear the crown
I here resign my government to thee
For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
And now may seem as wise as virtuous
For few men rightly temper with the stars
Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace
For choosing me when Clarence is in place
CLARENCE No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway
As likely to be blest in peace and war
And therefore I yield thee my free consent
WARWICK And I choose Clarence only for Protector
KING HENRY Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands
Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
That no dissension hinder government
I make you both Protectors of this land
While I myself will lead a private life
And in devotion spend my latter days
CLARENCE That he consents if Warwick yield consent
For on thy fortune I repose myself
WARWICK Why then though loath yet must I be content
I mean in bearing weight of government
While he enjoys the honour and his ease
And Clarence now then it is more than needful
And all his lands and goods confiscated
WARWICK Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part
KING HENRY But with the first of all your chief affairs
That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward
Be sent for to return from France with speed
For till I see them here by doubtful fear
CLARENCE It shall be done my sovereign with all speed
KING HENRY My Lord of Somerset what youth is that
Of whom you seem to have so tender care
SOMERSET My liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond
If secret powers
Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
His looks are full of peaceful majesty
His hand to wield a sceptre and himself
Likely in time to bless a regal throne
Make much of him my lords for this is he
Must help you more than you are hurt by me
Enter a POST
WARWICK What news my friend
POST That Edward is escaped from your brother
And fled as he hears since to Burgundy
WARWICK Unsavoury news But how made he escape
And the Lord Hastings who attended him
In secret ambush on the forest side
For hunting was his daily exercise
WARWICK My brother was too careless of his charge
But let us hence my sovereign to provide
A salve for any sore that may betide
Exeunt all but SOMERSET RICHMOND and OXFORD
For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help
Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond
So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
What may befall him to his harm and ours
Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst
Till storms be past of civil enmity
OXFORD Ay for if Edward repossess the crown
SOMERSET It shall be so he shall to Brittany
SCENE VII
Before York
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and soldiers
KING EDWARD Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest
Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends
And says that once more I shall interchange
And brought desired help from Burgundy
From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York
But that we enter as into our dukedom
GLOUCESTER The gates made fast Brother I like not this
For many men that stumble at the threshold
Are well foretold that danger lurks within
KING EDWARD Tush man abodements must not now affright us
By fair or foul means we must enter in
For hither will our friends repair to us
Enter on the walls the MAYOR OF YORK and
his BRETHREN
MAYOR My lords we were forewarned of your coming
And shut the gates for safety of ourselves
For now we owe allegiance unto Henry
KING EDWARD But Master Mayor if Henry be your King
Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York
MAYOR True my good lord I know you for no less
KING EDWARD Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom
As being well content with that alone
HASTINGS Why Master Mayor why stand you in a doubt
GLOUCESTER A wise stout captain and soon persuaded
HASTINGS The good old man would fain that all were well
I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade
Both him and all his brothers unto reason
Enter below the MAYOR and two ALDERMEN
KING EDWARD So Master Mayor These gates must not be shut
But in the night or in the time of war
What fear not man but yield me up the keys
For Edward will defend the town and thee
And all those friends that deign to follow me
March Enter MONTGOMERY with drum and soldiers
GLOUCESTER Brother this is Sir John Montgomery
KING EDWARD Welcome Sir john But why come you in arms
MONTGOMERY To help King Edward in his time of storm
As every loyal subject ought to do
KING EDWARD Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget
Our title to the crown and only claim
Our dukedom till God please to send the rest
MONTGOMERY Then fare you well for I will hence again
I came to serve a king and not a duke
Drummer strike up and let us march away
MONTGOMERY What talk you of debating In few words
To keep them back that come to succour you
Why shall we fight if you pretend no title
GLOUCESTER Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
HASTINGS Away with scrupulous wit Now arms must rule
GLOUCESTER And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
Brother we will proclaim you out of hand
The bruit thereof will bring you many friends
And Henry but usurps the diadem
MONTGOMERY Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
Come fellow soldier make thou proclamation
By this I challenge him to single fight
ALL Long live Edward the Fourth
KING EDWARD Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all
And when the morning sun shall raise his car
Above the border of this horizon
For well I wot that Henry is no soldier
Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems the
To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother
Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day
And that once gotten doubt not of large pay        Exeunt
SCENE VIII
London The palace
Flourish Enter KING HENRY WARWICK MONTAGUE CLARENCE OXFORD and EXETER
WARWICK What counsel lords Edward from Belgia
With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders
And with his troops doth march amain to London
And many giddy people flock to him
CLARENCE A little fire is quickly trodden out
Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence
Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent
The knights and gentlemen to come with thee
Thou brother Montague in Buckingham
Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find
In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
My sovereign with the loving citizens
Like to his island girt in with the ocean
Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs
Shall rest in London till we come to him
Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
Farewell my sovereign
MONTAGUE Comfort my lord and so I take my leave
adieu
KING HENRY Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague
And all at once once more a happy farewell
Exeunt all but the KING and EXETER
KING HENRY Here at the palace will I rest a while
Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship
Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
Should not be able to encounter mine
EXETER The doubt is that he will seduce the rest
Nor posted off their suits with slow delays
My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
I have not been desirous of their wealth
Then why should they love Edward more than me
No Exeter these graces challenge grace
And when the lion fawns upon the lamb
The lamb will never cease to follow him
EXETER Hark hark my lord What shouts are these
Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER and soldiers
And once again proclaim us King of England
You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow
Now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry
And swell so much the higher by their ebb
Hence with him to the Tower let him not speak
Exeunt some with KING HENRY
And lords towards Coventry bend we our course
Where peremptory Warwick now remains
The sun shines hot and if we use delay
GLOUCESTER Away betimes before his forces join
Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry         Exeunt

WARWICK Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford
How far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow

WARWICK How far off is our brother Montague
Where is the post that came from Montague
SECOND MESSENGER By this at Daintry with a puissant troop
Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE
WARWICK Say Somerville what says my loving son
And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now
SOMERVILLE At Southam I did leave him with his forces
And do expect him here some two hours hence
WARWICK Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum
SOMERVILLE It is not his my lord here Southam lies
The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick
SOMERVILLE They are at hand and you shall quickly know
March Flourish Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER
and soldiers
KING EDWARD Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
GLOUCESTER See how the surly Warwick mans the wall
WARWICK O unbid spite Is sportful Edward come
That we could hear no news of his repair
KING EDWARD Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy
And he shall pardon thee these outrages
WARWICK Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
Call Warwick patron and be penitent
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York
GLOUCESTER I thought at least he would have said the King
Or did he make the jest against his will
WARWICK Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
GLOUCESTER Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give
WARWICK Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight
And weakling Warwick takes his gift again
And Henry is my King Warwick his subject
And gallant Warwick do but answer this
What is the body when the head is off
GLOUCESTER Alas that Warwick had no more forecast
But whiles he thought to steal the single ten
GLOUCESTER Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down
Nay when Strike now or else the iron cools
WARWICK I had rather chop this hand off at a blow
And with the other fling it at thy face
Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
KING EDWARD Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
Enter OXFORD with drum and colours
WARWICK O cheerful colours See where Oxford comes
OXFORD Oxford Oxford for Lancaster
GLOUCESTER The gates are open let us enter too
KING EDWARD So other foes may set upon our backs
Stand we in good array for they no doubt
Will issue out again and bid us battle
If not the city being but of small defence
WARWICK O welcome Oxford for we want thy help
Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours
MONTAGUE Montague Montague for Lancaster
GLOUCESTER Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest
Enter SOMERSET with drum and colours
SOMERSET Somerset Somerset for Lancaster
GLOUCESTER Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset
Have sold their lives unto the house of York
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
Enter CLARENCE with drum and colours
WARWICK And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along
Of force enough to bid his brother battle
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
CLARENCE Clarence Clarence for Lancaster
A parley sirrah to George of Clarence
WARWICK Come Clarence come Thou wilt if Warwick call
Father of Warwick know you what this means
Look here I throw my infamy at thee
Who gave his blood to lime the stones together
And set up Lancaster Why trowest thou Warwick
That Clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful King
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath
To keep that oath were more impiety
I am so sorry for my trespass made
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
Pardon me Edward I will make amends
And Richard do not frown upon my faults
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant
KING EDWARD What Warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
I will away towards Barnet presently
KING EDWARD Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way
Lords to the field Saint George and victory
Exeunt YORKISTS
SCENE II
A field of battle near Barnet
Alarum and excursions Enter KING EDWARD bringing forth WARWICK wounded
KING EDWARD So lie thou there Die thou and die our fear
Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee
WARWICK Ah who is nigh Come to me friend or foe
And tell me who is victor York or Warwick
Why ask I that My mangled body shows
My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
That I must yield my body to the earth
And by my fall the conquest to my foe
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept
To search the secret treasons of the world
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow
My parks my walks my manors that I had
Even now forsake me and of all my lands
what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
And live we how we can yet die we must
Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET
SOMERSET Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are
We might recover all our loss again
The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power
Even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly
WARWICK Why then I would not fly Ah Montague
If thou be there sweet brother take my hand
And with thy lips keep in my soul a while
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
That glues my lips and will not let me speak
Come quickly Montague or I am dead
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick
And more he would have said and more he spoke
Which sounded like a clamour in a vault
I well might hear delivered with a groan
WARWICK Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
SCENE III
Another part of the field
Flourish Enter KING in triumph with GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and the rest
KING EDWARD Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
That will encounter with our glorious sun
I mean my lords those powers that the Queen
And as we hear march on to fight with us
CLARENCE A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
And blow it to the source from whence it came
Thy very beams will dry those vapours up
For every cloud engenders not a storm
GLOUCESTER The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong
And Somerset with Oxford fled to her
Her faction will be full as strong as ours
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury
We having now the best at Barnet field
Will thither straight for willingness rids way
And as we march our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along
SCENE IV

Flourish March Enter QUEEN MARGARET PRINCE EDWARD SOMERSET OXFORD
and SOLDIERS
loss
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms
What though the mast be now blown overboard
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water to the sea
And give more strength to that which hath too much
Whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
Ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
Say Warwick was our anchor what of that
Why is not Oxford here another anchor
And Somerset another goodly mast
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings
And though unskilful why not Ned and I
We will not from the helm to sit and weep
But keep our course though the rough wind say no
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair
And what is Edward but a ruthless sea
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock
All these the enemies to our poor bark
Tread on the sand why there you quickly sink
Bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
This speak I lords to let you understand
If case some one of you would fly from us
More than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
Why courage then What cannot be avoided
PRINCE OF WALES Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
Should if a coward hear her speak these words
Infuse his breast with magnanimity
I speak not this as doubting any here
For did I but suspect a fearful man
He should have leave to go away betimes
Lest in our need he might infect another
And make him of the like spirit to himself
Let him depart before we need his help
OXFORD Women and children of so high a courage
O brave young Prince thy famous grandfather
Doth live again in thee Long mayst thou Eve
To bear his image and renew his glories
SOMERSET And he that will not fight for such a hope
Go home to bed and like the owl by day
QUEEN MARGARET Thanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks
PRINCE OF WALES And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand
Ready to fight therefore be resolute
OXFORD I thought no less It is his policy
To haste thus fast to find us unprovided
QUEEN MARGARET This cheers my heart to see your forwardness
OXFORD Here pitch our battle hence we will not budge
Flourish and march Enter at a distance KING EDWARD
GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and soldiers
KING EDWARD Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
I need not add more fuel to your fire
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
Give signal to the fight and to it lords
QUEEN MARGARET Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say
My tears gainsay for every word I speak
Ye see I drink the water of my eye
Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign
And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
Be valiant and give signal to the fight
Alarum retreat excursions Exeunt
SCENE V
Another part of the field
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD GLOUCESTER CLARENCE and forces
With QUEEN MARGARET OXFORD and SOMERSET prisoners
KING EDWARD Now here a period of tumultuous broils
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight
For Somerset off with his guilty head
Go bear them hence I will not hear them speak
SOMERSET Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune
Exeunt OXFORD and SOMERSET guarded
QUEEN MARGARET So part we sadly in this troublous world
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem
KING EDWARD Is proclamation made that who finds Edward
Shall have a high reward and he his life
GLOUCESTER It is and lo where youthful Edward comes
Enter soldiers with PRINCE EDWARD
KING EDWARD Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
What can so young a man begin to prick
Edward what satisfaction canst thou make
For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects
PRINCE OF WALES Speak like a subject proud ambitious York
Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou
Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to
GLOUCESTER That you might still have worn the petticoat
His currish riddle sorts not with this place
QUEEN MARGARET Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men
PRINCE OF WALES Nay take away this scolding crookback rather
KING EDWARD Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue
PRINCE OF WALES I know my duty you are all undutiful
And thou misshapen Dick I tell ye all
I am your better traitors as ye are
KING EDWARD Take that the likeness of this railer here
QUEEN MARGARET O kill me too
KING EDWARD Hold Richard hold for we have done to much
GLOUCESTER Why should she live to fill the world with words
KING EDWARD What doth she swoon Use means for her recovery
GLOUCESTER Clarence excuse me to the King my brother
Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news
CLARENCE What what
GLOUCESTER The Tower the Tower                         Exit
QUEEN MARGARET O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy
Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers
Did not offend nor were not worthy blame
If this foul deed were by to equal it
He was a man this in respect a child
And I will speak that so my heart may burst
Butchers and villains bloody cannibals
You have no children butchers if you had
But if you ever chance to have a child
Look in his youth to have him so cut off
As deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince
KING EDWARD Away with her go bear her hence perforce
QUEEN MARGARET Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
What wilt thou not Then Clarence do it thou
CLARENCE By heaven I will not do thee so much ease
QUEEN MARGARET Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it
CLARENCE Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it
QUEEN MARGARET Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself
KING EDWARD Away I say I charge ye bear her hence
QUEEN MARGARET So come to you and yours as to this prince
Exit led out forcibly
CLARENCE To London all in post and as I guess
To make a bloody supper in the Tower
Now march we hence Discharge the common sort
And see our gentle queen how well she fares
By this I hope she hath a son for me               Exeunt
SCENE VI
London The Tower
Enter KING HENRY and GLOUCESTER with the LIEUTENANT on the walls
GLOUCESTER Good day my lord What at your book so hard
GLOUCESTER Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer
Exit LIEUTENANT
KING HENRY So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act
GLOUCESTER Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
The thief doth fear each bush an officer
KING HENRY The bird that hath been limed in a bush
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
And I the hapless male to one sweet bird
Have now the fatal object in my eye
GLOUCESTER Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete
That taught his son the office of a fowl
KING HENRY I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus
Thy father Minos that denied our course
Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
Than can my ears that tragic history
KING HENRY A persecutor I am sure thou art
If murdering innocents be executing
Why then thou are an executioner
And thus I prophesy that many a thousand
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
Men for their sons wives for their husbands
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
To wit an indigest deformed lump
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
And if the rest be true which I have heard
KING HENRY Ay and for much more slaughter after this
GLOUCESTER What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted
O may such purple tears be always shed
From those that wish the downfall of our house
If any spark of life be yet remaining
I that have neither pity love nor fear
For I have often heard my mother say
I came into the world with my legs forward
Had I not reason think ye to make haste
And so I was which plainly signified
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog
I have no brother I am like no brother
Be resident in men like one another
And not in me I am myself alone
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee
For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
That Edward shall be fearful of his life
King Henry and the Prince his son are gone
Clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
Counting myself but bad till I be best
And triumph Henry in thy day of doom
Exit with the body
SCENE VII
London The palace
Flourish Enter KING EDWARD QUEEN ELIZABETH CLARENCE GLOUCESTER
HASTINGS NURSE with the Young PRINCE and attendants
For hardy and undoubted champions
Two Cliffords as the father and the son
With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security
Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy
Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain
And heave it shall some weight or break my back
KING EDWARD Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen
And kiss your princely nephew brothers both
CLARENCE The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
KING EDWARD Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit
KING EDWARD Now am I seated as my soul delights
CLARENCE What will your Grace have done with Margaret
Reignier her father to the King of France
And hither have they sent it for her ransom
KING EDWARD Away with her and waft her hence to France
And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
Such as befits the pleasure of the court
Sound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy
For here I hope begins our lasting joy             Exeunt

I come no more to make you laugh things now
That bear a weighty and a serious brow
Sad high and working full of state and woe
Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow
We now present Those that can pity here
May if they think it well let fall a tear
The subject will deserve it Such as give
Their money out of hope they may believe
May here find truth too Those that come to see
Only a show or two and so agree
The play may pass if they be still and willing
Richly in two short hours Only they
That come to hear a merry bawdy play
A noise of targets or to see a fellow
In a long motley coat guarded with yellow
To rank our chosen truth with such a show
As fool and fight is beside forfeiting
Our own brains and the opinion that we bring
To make that only true we now intend
Will leave us never an understanding friend
Therefore for goodness sake and as you are known
The first and happiest hearers of the town
Be sad as we would make ye Think ye see
The very persons of our noble story
As they were living think you see them great
Of thousand friends then in a moment see
How soon this mightiness meets misery

ACT I SCENE 1
London The palace
Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK at one door at the other
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM and the LORD ABERGAVENNY
BUCKINGHAM Good morrow and well met How have ye done
Since last we saw in France
NORFOLK I thank your Grace
Healthful and ever since a fresh admirer
Of what I saw there
BUCKINGHAM An untimely ague
Those suns of glory those two lights of men
Met in the vale of Andren
I was then present saw them salute on horseback
Beheld them when they lighted how they clung
In their embracement as they grew together
Such a compounded one
BUCKINGHAM All the whole time
NORFOLK Then you lost
The view of earthly glory men might say
Till this time pomp was single but now married
To one above itself Each following day
All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods
Made Britain India every man that stood
As cherubins an gilt the madams too
The pride upon them that their very labour
Was to them as a painting Now this masque
Made it a fool and beggar The two kings
Equal in lustre were now best now worst
As presence did present them him in eye
still him in praise and being present both
The noble spirits to arms they did perform
Being now seen possible enough got credit
BUCKINGHAM O you go far
NORFOLK As I belong to worship and affect
Would by a good discourser lose some life
Order gave each thing view The office did
Distinctly his full function
I mean who set the body and the limbs
Of this great sport together as you guess
NORFOLK One certes that promises no element
In such a business
BUCKINGHAM I pray you who my lord
Of the right reverend Cardinal of York
From his ambitious finger What had he
To do in these fierce vanities I wonder
That such a keech can with his very bulk
And keep it from the earth
NORFOLK Surely sir
A gift that heaven gives for him which buys
A place next to the King
ABERGAVENNY I cannot tell
Pierce into that but I can see his pride
Peep through each part of him Whence has he that
If not from hell the devil is a niggard
Or has given all before and he begins
A new hell in himself
BUCKINGHAM Why the devil
Who should attend on him He makes up the file
Of all the gentry for the most part such
To whom as great a charge as little honour
He meant to lay upon and his own letter
The honourable board of council out
Must fetch him in he papers
ABERGAVENNY I do know
Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have
They shall abound as formerly
BUCKINGHAM O many
For this great journey What did this vanity
But minister communication of
A most poor issue
NORFOLK Grievingly I think
The peace between the French and us not values
The cost that did conclude it
BUCKINGHAM Every man
Dashing the garment of this peace aboded
NORFOLK Which is budded out
ABERGAVENNY Is it therefore
At a superfluous rate
BUCKINGHAM Why all this business
Our reverend Cardinal carried
NORFOLK Like it your Grace
The state takes notice of the private difference
And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
Together to consider further that
What his high hatred would effect wants not
A minister in his power You know his nature
Thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel
That I advise your shunning
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY the purse borne before
him certain of the guard and two SECRETARIES
with papers The CARDINAL in his passage fixeth his
eye on BUCKINGHAM and BUCKINGHAM on him
both full of disdain
SECRETARY Here so please you
WOLSEY Is he in person ready
SECRETARY Ay please your Grace
WOLSEY Well we shall then know more and Buckingham
shall lessen this big look
Exeunt WOLSEY and his train
Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best
Which your disease requires
Me as his abject object At this instant
NORFOLK Stay my lord
And let your reason with your choler question
Requires slow pace at first Anger is like
Can advise me like you be to yourself
As you would to your friend
And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
That it do singe yourself We may outrun
By violent swiftness that which we run at
I say again there is no English soul
More stronger to direct you than yourself
If with the sap of reason you would quench
Or but allay the fire of passion
BUCKINGHAM Sir
Whom from the flow of gan I name not but
From sincere motions by intelligence
And proofs as clear as founts in July when
To be corrupt and treasonous
NORFOLK Say not treasonous
As shore of rock Attend this holy fox
As he is subtle and as prone to mischief
Only to show his pomp as well in France
As here at home suggests the King our master
That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass
NORFOLK Faith and so it did
BUCKINGHAM Pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal
Who cannot err he did it Now this follows
Which as I take it is a kind of puppy
His fears were that the interview betwixt
England and France might through their amity
Breed him some prejudice for from this league
Which I do well for I am sure the Emperor
And break the foresaid peace Let the King know
As soon he shall by me that thus the Cardinal
Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
And for his own advantage
NORFOLK I am sorry
To hear this of him and could wish he were
BUCKINGHAM No not a syllable
I do pronounce him in that very shape
He shall appear in proof
and two or three of the guard
BRANDON Your office sergeant execute it
SERGEANT Sir
My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl
Of Hereford Stafford and Northampton I
Arrest thee of high treason in the name
Of our most sovereign King
BUCKINGHAM Lo you my lord
Under device and practice
BRANDON I am sorry
BUCKINGHAM It will help nothing
To plead mine innocence for that dye is on me
Be done in this and all things I obey
BRANDON Nay he must bear you company
How he determines further
ABERGAVENNY As the Duke said
BRANDON Here is warrant from
BUCKINGHAM So so
BUCKINGHAM O Nicholas Hopkins
BRANDON He
I am the shadow of poor Buckingham
Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
Exeunt
ACT I SCENE 2
London The Council Chamber
and SIR THOMAS LOVELL with others The CARDINAL places himself
KING My life itself and the best heart of it
And point by point the treasons of his master
He shall again relate
and SUFFOLK she kneels The KING riseth
from his state takes her up kisses and placeth her
by him
QUEEN KATHARINE Nay we must longer kneel I am suitor
KING Arise and take place by us Half your suit
Never name to us you have half our power
The other moiety ere you ask is given
Repeat your will and take it
QUEEN KATHARINE Thank your Majesty
That you would love yourself and in that love
Not unconsidered leave your honour nor
The dignity of your office is the point
Of my petition
KING Lady mine proceed
QUEEN KATHARINE I am solicited not by a few
And those of true condition that your subjects
Are in great grievance there have been commissions
Of all their loyalties wherein although
My good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches
Language unmannerly yea such which breaks
The sides of loyalty and almost appears
In loud rebellion
It doth appear for upon these taxations
The clothiers all not able to maintain
The spinsters carders fullers weavers who
And lack of other means in desperate manner
And danger serves among them
KING Taxation
Wherein and what taxation My Lord Cardinal
Know you of this taxation
WOLSEY Please you sir
I know but of a single part in aught
Where others tell steps with me
QUEEN KATHARINE No my lord
You know no more than others But you frame
Things that are known alike which are not wholesome
To those which would not know them and yet must
Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions
Whereof my sovereign would have note they are
Too hard an exclamation
KING Still exaction
Is this exaction
QUEEN KATHARINE I am much too venturous
Comes through commissions which compels from each
The sixth part of his substance to be levied
Without delay and the pretence for this
Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze
Allegiance in them their curses now
This tractable obedience is a slave
To each incensed will I would your Highness
Would give it quick consideration for
There is no primer business
KING By my life
This is against our pleasure
WOLSEY And for me
I have no further gone in this than by
By learned approbation of the judges If I am
My faculties nor person yet will be
The chronicles of my doing let me say
That virtue must go through We must not stint
Our necessary actions in the fear
To cope malicious censurers which ever
Than vainly longing What we oft do best
By sick interpreters once weak ones is
Hitting a grosser quality is cried up
For our best act If we shall stand still
We should take root here where we sit or sit
KING Things done well
And with a care exempt themselves from fear
Things done without example in their issue
Of this commission I believe not any
We must not rend our subjects from our laws
And stick them in our will Sixth part of each
A trembling contribution Why we take
The air will drink the sap To every county
Free pardon to each man that has denied
The force of this commission Pray look tot
I put it to your care
Let there be letters writ to every shire
That through our intercession this revokement
And pardon comes I shall anon advise you
Further in the proceeding                         Exit SECRETARY
Enter SURVEYOR
QUEEN KATHARINE I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
Is run in your displeasure
KING It grieves many
To nature none more bound his training such
That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
And never seek for aid out of himself Yet see
When these so noble benefits shall prove
They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly
Than ever they were fair This man so complete
Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
That once were his and is become as black
Things to strike honour sad Bid him recount
We cannot feel too little hear too much
WOLSEY Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you
Most like a careful subject have collected
Out of the Duke of Buckingham
KING Speak freely
To make the sceptre his These very words
Revenge upon the Cardinal
WOLSEY Please your Highness note
This dangerous conception in this point
Not friended by his wish to your high person
His will is most malignant and it stretches
Beyond you to your friends
Deliver all with charity
KING Speak on
How grounded he his title to the crown
Upon our fail To this point hast thou heard him
At any time speak aught
SURVEYOR He was brought to this
By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton
KING What was that Henton
SURVEYOR Sir a Chartreux friar
His confessor who fed him every minute
With words of sovereignty
SURVEYOR Not long before your Highness sped to France
The Duke being at the Rose within the parish
Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand
What was the speech among the Londoners
Concerning the French journey I replied
John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour
To hear from him a matter of some moment
He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
My chaplain to no creature living but
To me should utter with demure confidence
Tell you the Duke shall prosper bid him strive
QUEEN KATHARINE If I know you well
You charge not in your spleen a noble person
And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed
Yes heartily beseech you
KING Let him on
Go forward
for him
To ruminate on this so far until
Should have gone off
KING Ha what so rank Ah ha
SURVEYOR I can my liege
KING Proceed
SURVEYOR Being at Greenwich
KING I remember
Of such a time being my sworn servant
The part my father meant to act upon
As he made semblance of his duty would
KING A giant traitor
WOLSEY Now madam may his Highness live in freedom
And this man out of prison
QUEEN KATHARINE God mend all
He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour
His father by as much as a performance
Does an irresolute purpose
Call him to present trial If he may
ACT I SCENE 3
London The palace
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN and LORD SANDYS
Men into such strange mysteries
SANDYS New customs
Though they be never so ridiculous
CHAMBERLAIN As far as I see all the good our English
Have got by the late voyage is but merely
Their very noses had been counsellors
To Pepin or Clotharius they keep state so
SANDYS They have all new legs and lame ones One would take it
CHAMBERLAIN Death my lord
Enter SIR THOMAS LOVELL
How now
What news Sir Thomas Lovell
LOVELL Faith my lord
I hear of none but the new proclamation
That fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors
To think an English courtier may be wise
And never see the Louvre
LOVELL They must either
For so run the conditions leave those remnants
Of fool and feather that they got in France
With all their honourable points of ignorance
Abusing better men than they can be
The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings
And understand again like honest men
Or pack to their old playfellows There I take it
They may cum privilegio wear away
Are grown so catching
CHAMBERLAIN What a loss our ladies
Will have of these trim vanities
LOVELL Ay marry
There will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons
Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies
A French song and a fiddle has no fellow
An honest country lord as I am beaten
A long time out of play may bring his plainsong
Held current music too
CHAMBERLAIN Well said Lord Sandys
SANDYS No my lord
Nor shall not while I have a stamp
CHAMBERLAIN Sir Thomas
Your lordship is a guest too
This night he makes a supper and a great one
To many lords and ladies there will be
LOVELL That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed
A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us
His dews fall everywhere
He had a black mouth that said other of him
SANDYS He may my lord has wherewithal In him
Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine
Men of his way should be most liberal
They are set here for examples
CHAMBERLAIN True they are so
But few now give so great ones My barge stays
Your lordship shall along Come good Sir Thomas
We shall be late else which I would not be
For I was spoke to with Sir Henry Guildford
This night to be comptrollers

As first good company good wine good welcome
Can make good people
Enter LORD CHAMBERLAIN LORD SANDYS and SIR
THOMAS LOVELL
The very thought of this fair company
CHAMBERLAIN You are young Sir Harry Guildford
SANDYS Sir Thomas Lovell had the Cardinal
But half my lay thoughts in him some of these
Should find a running banquet ere they rested
They are a sweet society of fair ones
LOVELL O that your lordship were but now confessor
To one or two of these
SANDYS I would I were
They should find easy penance
LOVELL Faith how easy
SANDYS As easy as a down bed would afford it
CHAMBERLAIN Sweet ladies will it please you sit Sir Harry
Pray sit between these ladies
SANDYS By my faith
And thank your lordship By your leave sweet ladies
If I chance to talk a little wild forgive me
I had it from my father
ANNE Was he mad sir
SANDYS O very mad exceeding mad in love too
But he would bite none just as I do now
CHAMBERLAIN Well said my lord
The penance lies on you if these fair ladies
Pass away frowning
SANDYS For my little cure
Let me alone
Hautboys Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY attended and
takes his state
Or gentleman that is not freely merry

ANNE You cannot show me
SANDYS I told your Grace they would talk anon
CHAMBERLAIN Look out there some of ye             Exit a SERVANT
WOLSEY What warlike voice
And to what end is this Nay ladies fear not
And hither make as great ambassadors
From foreign princes
WOLSEY Good Lord Chamberlain
Into our presence where this heaven of beauty
Shall shine at full upon them Some attend him
A good digestion to you all and once more
Hautboys Enter the KING and others as maskers
They pass directly before the CARDINAL
and gracefully salute him
A noble company What are their pleasures
To tell your Grace that having heard by fame
Of this so noble and so fair assembly
This night to meet here they could do no less
Out of the great respect they bear to beauty
But leave their flocks and under your fair conduct
Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
WOLSEY Say Lord Chamberlain
WOLSEY My lord
CHAMBERLAIN Your Grace
More worthy this place than myself to whom
If I but knew him with my love and duty
I would surrender it
CHAMBERLAIN I will my lord
WOLSEY What say they
CHAMBERLAIN Such a one they all confess
There is indeed which they would have your Grace
Find out and he will take it
My royal choice
You hold a fair assembly you do well lord
I should judge now unhappily
WOLSEY I am glad
Your Grace is grown so pleasant
KING My Lord Chamberlain
KING By heaven she is a dainty one Sweet heart
I were unmannerly to take you out
And not to kiss you A health gentlemen
Let it go round
WOLSEY Sir Thomas Lovell is the banquet ready
LOVELL Yes my lord
WOLSEY Your Grace

KING I fear too much
In the next chamber
Good my Lord Cardinal I have half a dozen healths
To drink to these fair ladies and a measure
Exeunt with trumpets

ACT II SCENE 1
Westminster A street
Enter two GENTLEMEN at several doors
FIRST GENTLEMAN Whither away so fast
SECOND GENTLEMAN O God save ye
Of the great Duke of Buckingham
Of bringing back the prisoner
SECOND GENTLEMAN Were you there
FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes indeed was I
FIRST GENTLEMAN You may guess quickly what
SECOND GENTLEMAN Is he found guilty
FIRST GENTLEMAN So are a number more
Came to the bar where to his accusations
He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
Many sharp reasons to defeat the law
To have brought viva voce to his face
Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car
Hopkins that made this mischief
SECOND GENTLEMAN That was he
That fed him with his prophecies
FIRST GENTLEMAN The same
Would have flung from him but indeed he could not
And so his peers upon this evidence
Have found him guilty of high treason Much
He spoke and learnedly for life but all
Was either pitied in him or forgotten
With such an agony he sweat extremely
And something spoke in choler ill and hasty
But he fell to himself again and sweetly
SECOND GENTLEMAN I do not think he fears death
FIRST GENTLEMAN Sure he does not
He never was so womanish the cause
He may a little grieve at
SECOND GENTLEMAN Certainly
The Cardinal is the end of this
Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too
Lest he should help his father
SECOND GENTLEMAN That trick of state
Was a deep envious one
FIRST GENTLEMAN At his return
No doubt he will requite it This is noted
And generally whoever the King favours
The Cardinal instantly will find employment
And far enough from court too
SECOND GENTLEMAN All the commons
Wish him ten fathom deep this Duke as much
They love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham
before him the axe with the edge towards him halberds
on each side accompanied with SIR THOMAS
LOVELL SIR NICHOLAS VAUX SIR WILLIAM SANDYS
and common people etc
FIRST GENTLEMAN Stay there sir
BUCKINGHAM All good people
You that thus far have come to pity me
Hear what I say and then go home and lose me
And by that name must die yet heaven bear witness
And if I have a conscience let it sink me
Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful
The law I bear no malice for my death
But those that sought it I could wish more Christians
Nor build their evils on the graves of great men
Nor will I sue although the King have mercies
And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham
His noble friends and fellows whom to leave
Is only bitter to him only dying
Go with me like good angels to my end
And as the long divorce of steel falls on me
Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
LOVELL I do beseech your Grace for charity
If ever any malice in your heart
Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly
BUCKINGHAM Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you
As I would be forgiven I forgive all
There cannot be those numberless offences
Shall mark my grave Commend me to his Grace
And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him
You met him half in heaven My vows and prayers
Shall cry for blessings on him May he live
Longer than I have time to tell his years
And when old time Shall lead him to his end
Goodness and he fill up one monument
Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux
Who undertakes you to your end
VAUX Prepare there
The Duke is coming see the barge be ready
And fit it with such furniture as suits
The greatness of his person
BUCKINGHAM Nay Sir Nicholas
Let it alone my state now will but mock me
When I came hither I was Lord High Constable
And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun
Yet I am richer than my base accusers
That never knew what truth meant I now seal it
My noble father Henry of Buckingham
Flying for succour to his servant Banister
Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying
Made my name once more noble Now his son
Henry the Eighth life honour name and all
That made me happy at one stroke has taken
For ever from the world I had my trial
And must needs say a noble one which makes me
A little happier than my wretched father
Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both
A most unnatural and faithless service
Heaven has an end in all Yet you that hear me
This from a dying man receive as certain
Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends
And give your hearts to when they once perceive
The least rub in your fortunes fall away
Like water from ye never found again
But where they mean to sink ye All good people
Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour
Of my long weary life is come upon me
Farewell
And when you would say something that is sad
Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and train
FIRST GENTLEMAN O this is full of pity Sir it calls
I fear too many curses on their heads
That were the authors
SECOND GENTLEMAN If the Duke be guiltless
Of an ensuing evil if it fall
Greater than this
FIRST GENTLEMAN Good angels keep it from us
What may it be You do not doubt my faith sir
A strong faith to conceal it
FIRST GENTLEMAN Let me have it
I do not talk much
SECOND GENTLEMAN I am confident
You shall sir Did you not of late days hear
A buzzing of a separation
Between the King and Katharine
FIRST GENTLEMAN Yes but it held not
For when the King once heard it out of anger
He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
To stop the rumour and allay those tongues
That durst disperse it
SECOND GENTLEMAN But that slander sir
Is found a truth now for it grows again
The King will venture at it Either the Cardinal
Or some about him near have out of malice
That will undo her To confirm this too
As all think for this business
And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
For not bestowing on him at his asking
not cruel
That she should feel the smart of this The Cardinal
Will have his will and she must fall
We are too open here to argue this

NORFOLK Well met my Lord Chamberlain
CHAMBERLAIN Good day to both your Graces
CHAMBERLAIN I left him private
Full of sad thoughts and troubles
Has crept too near his conscience
SUFFOLK No his conscience
Has crept too near another lady
That blind priest like the eldest son of fortune
Turns what he list The King will know him one day
NORFOLK How holily he works in all his business
Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience
And out of all these to restore the King
He counsels a divorce a loss of her
That like a jewel has hung twenty years
About his neck yet never lost her lustre
Of her that loves him with that excellence
That angels love good men with even of her
That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
This bold bad man
SUFFOLK And free us from his slavery
NORFOLK We had need pray and heartily for our deliverance
Or this imperious man will work us an
Into what pitch he please
SUFFOLK For me my lords
If the King please his curses and his blessings
I knew him and I know him so I leave him
And with some other business put the King
From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him
CHAMBERLAIN Excuse me
The King has sent me otherwhere besides
Health to your lordships
NORFOLK Thanks my good Lord Chamberlain
Exit LORD CHAMBERLAIN and the KING draws
the curtain and sits reading pensively
SUFFOLK How sad he looks sure he is much afflicted
NORFOLK Pray God he be not angry

Is business of estate in which we come
To know your royal pleasure

WOLSEY Sir you cannot

Of private conference
I would not be so sick though for his place
But this cannot continue
Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK
WOLSEY Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom
Above all princes in committing freely
Your scruple to the voice of Christendom
Who can be angry now What envy reach you
The Spaniard tied by blood and favour to her
Must now confess if they have any goodness
The trial just and noble All the clerks
I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms
Have their free voices Rome the nurse of judgment
Invited by your noble self hath sent
One general tongue unto us this good man
This just and learned priest Cardinal Campeius
Whom once more I present unto your Highness
KING And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome
And thank the holy conclave for their loves
In the unpartial judging of this business
KING Two equal men The Queen shall be acquainted
So dear in heart not to deny her that
KING Ay and the best she shall have and my favour
To him that does best God forbid else Cardinal
Prithee call Gardiner to me my new secretary
I find him a fit fellow                              Exit WOLSEY

CAMPEIUS My Lord of York was not one Doctor Pace
WOLSEY Yes he was
CAMPEIUS Was he not held a learned man
WOLSEY Yes surely
Even of yourself Lord Cardinal
WOLSEY How Of me
CAMPEIUS They will not stick to say you envied him
And fearing he would rise he was so virtuous
That he ran mad and died
For he would needs be virtuous that good fellow
If I command him follows my appointment
I will have none so near else Learn this brother
Exit GARDINER
The most convenient place that I can think of
For such receipt of learning is Blackfriars
Would it not grieve an able man to leave
So sweet a bedfellow But conscience conscience
ACT II SCENE 3

So good a lady that no tongue could ever

To give her the avaunt it is a pity
Would move a monster
OLD LADY Hearts of most hard temper
Melt and lament for her
Yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce
OLD LADY Alas poor lady
ANNE So much the more
Must pity drop upon her Verily
And range with humble livers in content
And wear a golden sorrow
OLD LADY Our content

ANNE By my troth and maidenhead
I would not be a queen
OLD LADY Beshrew me I would
For all this spice of your hypocrisy
You that have so fair parts of woman on you
Affected eminence wealth sovereignty

Saving your mincing the capacity
Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
If you might please to stretch it
ANNE Nay good troth
OLD LADY Yes troth and troth You would not be a queen
ANNE No not for all the riches under heaven
Old as I am to queen it But I pray you
What think you of a duchess Have you limbs

For all the world
OLD LADY In faith for little England
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN

Follow such creatures That you may fair lady
Perceive I speak sincerely and high notes

Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
Than Marchioness of Pembroke to which tide
A thousand pound a year annual support
Out of his grace he adds
ANNE I do not know
What kind of my obedience I should tender
More than my all is nothing nor my prayers
Are not words duly hallowed nor my wishes
More worth than empty vanities yet prayers and wishes
Are all I can return Beseech your lordship
Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience
As from a blushing handmaid to his Highness
Whose health and royalty I pray for
CHAMBERLAIN Lady
Beauty and honour in her are so mingled

But from this lady may proceed a gem
And say I spoke with you
OLD LADY Why this it is see see

QUEEN KATHARINE Sir I desire you do me right and justice
And to bestow your pity on me for
I am a most poor woman and a stranger
Born out of your dominions having here
No judge indifferent nor no more assurance
Of equal friendship and proceeding Alas sir
In what have I offended you What cause
Hath my behaviour given to your displeasure
That thus you should proceed to put me of
And take your good grace from me Heaven witness
I have been to you a true and humble wife
At all times to your will conformable
Ever in fear to kindle your dislike
I ever contradicted your desire
Or made it not mine too Or which of your friends
Have I not strove to love although I knew
He were mine enemy What friend of mine
Continue in my liking Nay gave notice
That I have been your wife in this obedience
Upward of twenty years and have been blest
With many children by you If in the course
And process of this time you can report
And prove it too against mine honour aught
My bond to wedlock or my love and duty
Shut door upon me and so give me up
The King your father was reputed for
A prince most prudent of an excellent
Of every realm that did debate this business
Beseech you sir to spare me till I may
WOLSEY You have here lady
Of singular integrity and learning
To plead your cause It shall be therefore bootless
That longer you desire the court as well

I am about to weep but thinking that
The daughter of a king my drops of tears
WOLSEY Be patient yet
QUEEN KATHARINE I Will when you are humble nay before
Or God will punish me I do believe
You are mine enemy and make my challenge
You shall not be my judge for it is you
I utterly abhor yea from my soul
Refuse you for my judge whom yet once more
I hold my most malicious foe and think not
At all a friend to truth
WOLSEY I do profess
You speak not like yourself who ever yet
Of disposition gentle and of wisdom
I have no spleen against you nor injustice
For you or any how far I have proceeded
Or how far further shall is warranted
By a commission from the Consistory
Yea the whole Consistory of Rome You charge me
That I have blown this coal I do deny it
The King is present if it be known to him
That I gainsay my deed how may he wound
And worthily my falsehood Yea as much
As you have done my truth If he know
That I am free of your report he knows
I am not of your wrong Therefore in him
It lies to cure me and the cure is to
Remove these thoughts from you the which before
His Highness shall speak in I do beseech
You gracious madam to unthink your speaking
And to say so no more
QUEEN KATHARINE My lord my lord
I am a simple woman much too weak
You sign your place and calling in full seeming
With meekness and humility but your heart
Yourself pronounce their office I must tell you
Your high profession spiritual that again
I do refuse you for my judge and here
Before you all appeal unto the Pope
CAMPEIUS The Queen is obstinate
Stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and
KING Call her again
CRIER Katharine Queen of England come into the court
QUEEN KATHARINE What need you note it Pray you keep your way
They vex me past my patience Pray you pass on

KING Go thy ways Kate
A better wife let him in nought be trusted
If thy rare qualities sweet gentleness
Obeying in commanding and thy parts
And like her true nobility she has
Carried herself towards me
WOLSEY Most gracious sir
In humblest manner I require your Highness
That it shall please you to declare in hearing
Did broach this business to your Highness or
Laid any scruple in your way which might
Have to you but with thanks to God for such
A royal lady spake one the least word that might
Be to the prejudice of her present state
Or touch of her good person
KING My Lord Cardinal
I do excuse you yea upon mine honour
That you have many enemies that know not
Why they are so but like to village curs
Bark when their fellows do By some of these
But will you be more justified You ever
The passages made toward it On my honour
I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point
I will be bold with time and your attention
Who had been hither sent on the debating
Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
Whether our daughter were legitimate
Respecting this our marriage with the dowager
Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble
I stood not in the smile of heaven who had
The grave does to the dead for her male issue
Or died where they were made or shortly after
This was a judgment on me that my kingdom
Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in
The wild sea of my conscience I did steer
Toward this remedy whereupon we are
I meant to rectify my conscience which
I then did feel full sick and yet not well
By all the reverend fathers of the land
With you my Lord of Lincoln you remember
How under my oppression I did reek
LINCOLN Very well my liege
How far you satisfied me
LINCOLN So please your Highness
And did entreat your Highness to this course
Which you are running here
My Lord of Canterbury and got your leave
To make this present summons Unsolicited
I left no reverend person in this court
But by particular consent proceeded
Under your hands and seals therefore go on
Of the good Queen but the sharp thorny points
Of my alleged reasons drives this forward
Prove but our marriage lawful by my life
And kingly dignity we are contented
To wear our moral state to come with her
Katharine our queen before the primest creature
CAMPEIUS So please your Highness
That we adjourn this court till further day
Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
Made to the Queen to call back her appeal
She intends unto his Holiness
These cardinals trifle with me I abhor
This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome
Prithee return With thy approach I know
I say set on                   Exuent in manner as they entered

ACT III SCENE 1
Enter the QUEEN and her women as at work
QUEEN KATHARINE Take thy lute wench My soul grows
sad with troubles
SONG
Orpheus with his lute made trees
And the mountain tops that freeze
Bow themselves when he did sing
To his music plants and flowers
Ever sprung as sun and showers
There had made a lasting spring
Every thing that heard him play
Even the billows of the sea
Hung their heads and then lay by
In sweet music is such art
Killing care and grief of heart
Fall asleep or hearing die
Enter a GENTLEMAN
QUEEN KATHARINE How now
Wait in the presence
QUEEN KATHARINE Would they speak with me
QUEEN KATHARINE Pray their Graces
They should be good men their affairs as righteous
But all hoods make not monks
Enter the two CARDINALS WOLSEY and CAMPEIUS
WOLSEY Peace to your Highness
QUEEN KATHARINE Your Graces find me here part of housewife
I would be all against the worst may happen
What are your pleasures with me reverend lords
WOLSEY May it please you noble madam to withdraw
Into your private chamber we shall give you
The full cause of our coming
QUEEN KATHARINE Speak it here
Deserves a corner Would all other women
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do
I know my life so even If your business
Seek me out and that way I am wife in
Out with it boldly truth loves open dealing
QUEEN KATHARINE O good my lord no Latin
I am not such a truant since my coming
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious
Pray speak in English Here are some will thank you
Believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal
WOLSEY Noble lady
I am sorry my integrity should breed
And service to his Majesty and you
So deep suspicion where all faith was meant
We come not by the way of accusation
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses
You have too much good lady but to know
How you stand minded in the weighty difference
Between the King and you and to deliver
Like free and honest men our just opinions
And comforts to your cause
My Lord of York out of his noble nature
Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace
Forgetting like a good man your late censure
Offers as I do in a sign of peace
His service and his counsel
My lords I thank you both for your good wins
But how to make ye suddenly an answer
In such a point of weight so near mine honour
More near my life I fear with my weak wit
And to such men of gravity and learning
In truth I know not I was set at work
Among my maids full little God knows looking
Either for such men or such business
Let me have time and counsel for my cause
Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless
Your hopes and friends are infinite
QUEEN KATHARINE In England
But little for my profit can you think lords
That any Englishman dare give me counsel
And live a subject Nay forsooth my friends
They that must weigh out my afflictions
They that my trust must grow to live not here
They are as all my other comforts far hence
In mine own country lords
CAMPEIUS I would your Grace
Would leave your griefs and take my counsel
QUEEN KATHARINE How sir
Both for your honour better and your cause
WOLSEY He tells you rightly
Is this your Christian counsel Out upon ye
Heaven is above all yet there sits a Judge
That no king can corrupt
CAMPEIUS Your rage mistakes us
QUEEN KATHARINE The more shame for ye holy men I thought ye
Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye
I will not wish ye half my miseries
I have more charity but say I warned ye
The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye
WOLSEY Madam this is a mere distraction
You turn the good we offer into envy
QUEEN KATHARINE Ye turn me into nothing Woe upon ye
If you have any justice any pity
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me
His love too long ago I am old my lords
And all the fellowship I hold now with him
Is only my obedience What can happen
To me above this wretchedness All your studies
Make me a curse like this
CAMPEIUS Your fears are worse
Never yet branded with suspicion
Have I with all my full affections
Been out of fondness superstitious to him
Almost forgot my prayers to content him
Bring me a constant woman to her husband
And to that woman when she has done most
WOLSEY Madam you wander from the good we aim at
QUEEN KATHARINE My lord I dare not make myself so guilty
To give up willingly that noble title
Your master wed me to nothing but death
WOLSEY Pray hear me
QUEEN KATHARINE Would I had never trod this English earth
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it
What will become of me now wretched lady
I am the most unhappy woman living
your fortunes
No friends no hope no kindred weep for me
WOLSEY If your Grace
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest
Upon what cause wrong you Alas our places
The way of our profession is against it
How you may hurt yourself ay utterly
The hearts of princes kiss obedience
So much they love it but to stubborn spirits
They swell and grow as terrible as storms
I know you have a gentle noble temper
A soul as even as a calm Pray think us
As yours was put into you ever casts
Such doubts as false coin from it The King loves you
Beware you lose it not For us if you please
To trust us in your business we are ready
To use our utmost studies in your service
QUEEN KATHARINE Do what ye will my lords and pray
forgive me
You know I am a woman lacking wit
To make a seemly answer to such persons
Pray do my service to his Majesty
He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
While I shall have my life Come reverend fathers
Bestow your counsels on me she now begs
That little thought when she set footing here
She should have bought her dignities so dear              Exeunt
ACT IIISCENE 2
London The palace
Enter the DUKE OF NORFOLK the DUKE OF SUFFOLK the EARL OF SURREY
and the LORD CHAMBERLAIN
NORFOLK If you will now unite in your complaints
And force them with a constancy the Cardinal
Cannot stand under them if you omit
The offer of this time I cannot promise
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces
With these you bear already
SURREY I am joyful
To meet the least occasion that may give me
SUFFOLK Which of the peers
Strangely neglected When did he regard
The stamp of nobleness in any person
Out of himself
CHAMBERLAIN My lords you speak your pleasures
What he deserves of you and me I know
Anything on him for he hath a witchcraft
NORFOLK O fear him not
His spell in that is out the King hath found
Matter against him that for ever mars
Not to come off in his displeasure
SURREY Sir
I should be glad to hear such news as this
Once every hour
NORFOLK Believe it this is true
In the divorce his contrary proceedings
Are all unfolded wherein he appears
As I would wish mine enemy
SURREY How came
His practices to light
SUFFOLK Most Strangely
SURREY O how how
How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness
My king is tangled in affection to
SURREY Has the King this
SUFFOLK Believe it
SURREY Will this work
CHAMBERLAIN The King in this perceives him how he coasts
And hedges his own way But in this point
All his tricks founder and he brings his physic
Hath married the fair lady
SURREY Would he had
SUFFOLK May you be happy in your wish my lord
For I profess you have it
SURREY Now all my joy
Trace the conjunction
Marry this is yet but young and may be left
To some ears unrecounted But my lords
She is a gallant creature and complete
In mind and feature I persuade me from her
Will fall some blessing to this land which shall
SURREY But will the King
The Lord forbid
NORFOLK Marry amen
SUFFOLK No no
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
Will make this sting the sooner Cardinal Campeius
Is posted as the agent of our Cardinal
To second all his plot I do assure you
CHAMBERLAIN Now God incense him
NORFOLK But my lord
When returns Cranmer
Have satisfied the King for his divorce
Together with all famous colleges
Almost in Christendom Shortly I believe
Her coronation Katharine no more
And widow to Prince Arthur
SUFFOLK He has and we shall see him
For it an archbishop
NORFOLK So I hear
Enter WOLSEY and CROMWELL
The Cardinal
WOLSEY The packet Cromwell
CROMWELL Presently
He did it with a serious mind a heed
Was in his countenance You he bade
Attend him here this morning
WOLSEY Is he ready
To come abroad
CROMWELL I think by this he is
WOLSEY Leave me awhile                              Exit CROMWELL
To hear from Rome The Marchioness of Pembroke
SUFFOLK May be he hears the King
Does whet his anger to him
SURREY Sharp enough
Lord for thy justice
daughter
Then out it goes What though I know her virtuous
And well deserving Yet I know her for
A spleeny Lutheran and not wholesome to
An heretic an arch one Cranmer one
And is his oracle
Enter the KING reading of a schedule and LOVELL
SUFFOLK The King the King
KING What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
Saw you the Cardinal
NORFOLK My lord we have
Stood here observing him Some strange commotion
Is in his brain he bites his lip and starts
Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground
Then lays his finger on his temple straight
Springs out into fast gait then stops again
Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts
His eye against the moon In most strange postures
We have seen him set himself
KING It may well be
Papers of state he sent me to peruse
Forsooth an inventory thus importing
The several parcels of his plate his treasure
Rich stuffs and ornaments of household which
I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks
Possession of a subject
Some spirit put this paper in the packet
To bless your eye withal
KING If we did think
His contemplation were above the earth
dwell in his musings but I am afraid
His thinkings are below the moon not worth
His serious considering
WOLSEY Heaven forgive me
Ever God bless your Highness
KING Good my lord
You are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory
Of your best graces in your mind the which
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
To keep your earthly audit sure in that
I deem you an ill husband and am glad
To have you therein my companion
WOLSEY Sir
For holy offices I have a time a time
To think upon the part of business which
Her times of preservation which perforce
I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal
Must give my tendance to
KING You have said well
WOLSEY And ever may your Highness yoke together
As I will lend you cause my doing well
With my well saying
He said he did and with his deed did crown
His word upon you Since I had my office
I have kept you next my heart have not alone
My bounties upon you
KING Have I not made you
The prime man of the state I pray you tell me
If what I now pronounce you have found true
And if you may confess it say withal
If you are bound to us or no What say you
WOLSEY My sovereign I confess your royal graces
My studied purposes requite which went
Have ever come too short of my desires
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
The profit of the state For your great graces
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks
Which ever has and ever shall be growing
Till death that winter kill it
A loyal and obedient subject is
Therein illustrated the honour of it
The foulness is the punishment I presume
On you than any so your hand and heart
Your brain and every function of your power
Should notwithstanding that your bond of duty
To me your friend than any
WOLSEY I do profess
Though all the world should crack their duty to you
And throw it from their soul though perils did
As doth a rock against the chiding flood
Should the approach of this wild river break
And stand unshaken yours
Take notice lords he has a loyal breast
And after this and then to breakfast with
What appetite you have
Exit the KING frowning upon the CARDINAL the NOBLES
throng after him smiling and whispering
WOLSEY What should this mean
He parted frowning from me as if ruin
Then makes him nothing I must read this paper
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
For mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom
And fee my friends in Rome O negligence
Fit for a fool to fall by What cross devil
Made me put this main secret in the packet
I sent the King Is there no way to cure this
No new device to beat this from his brains
A way if it take right in spite of fortune
The letter as I live with all the business
And from that full meridian of my glory
I haste now to my setting I shall fall
Like a bright exhalation in the evening
And no man see me more
SUFFOLK the EARL OF SURREY and the LORD
CHAMBERLAIN
To render up the great seal presently
Into our hands and to confine yourself
Till you hear further from his Highness
WOLSEY Stay
Authority so weighty
I dare and must deny it Now I feel
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces
As if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin
Follow your envious courses men of malice
In time will find their fit rewards That seal
Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours
During my life and to confirm his goodness
SURREY The King that gave it
WOLSEY It must be himself then
SURREY Thou art a proud traitor priest
WOLSEY Proud lord thou liest
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
Have burnt that tongue than said so
SURREY Thy ambition
The heads of all thy brother cardinals
With thee and all thy best parts bound together
You sent me deputy for Ireland
Far from his succour from the King from all
Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity
WOLSEY This and all else
This talking lord can lay upon my credit
I answer is most false The Duke by law
Found his deserts how innocent I was
From any private malice in his end
His noble jury and foul cause can witness
You have as little honesty as honour
That in the way of loyalty and truth
Toward the King my ever royal master
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be
And an that love his follies
SURREY By my soul
Your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance
And from this fellow If we live thus tamely
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet
Farewell nobility Let his Grace go forward
And dare us with his cap like larks
WOLSEY All goodness
Is poison to thy stomach
SURREY Yes that goodness
Into your own hands Cardinal by extortion
The goodness of your intercepted packets
Since you provoke me shall be most notorious
My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble
As you respect the common good the state
Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles
Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench
Lay kissing in your arms Lord Cardinal
WOLSEY How much methinks I could despise this man
But that I am bound in charity against it
But thus much they are foul ones
WOLSEY So much fairer
And spotless shall mine innocence arise
When the King knows my truth
SURREY This cannot save you
I thank my memory I yet remember
Some of these articles and out they shall
Now if you can blush and cry guilty Cardinal
WOLSEY Speak on sir
I dare your worst objections If I blush
It is to see a nobleman want manners
SURREY I had rather want those than my head Have at you
You wrought to be a legate by which power
NORFOLK Then that in all you writ to Rome or else
To be your servant
SUFFOLK Then that without the knowledge
Either of King or Council when you went
Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold
To carry into Flanders the great seal
SURREY Item you sent a large commission
To Gregory de Cassado to conclude
A league between his Highness and Ferrara
SURREY Then that you have sent innumerable substance
By what means got I leave to your own conscience
To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways
You have for dignities to the mere undoing
Of all the kingdom Many more there are
Which since they are of you and odious
I will not taint my mouth with
CHAMBERLAIN O my lord
His faults lie open to the laws let them
Not you correct him My heart weeps to see him
So little of his great self
SURREY I forgive him
Because all those things you have done of late
By your power legatine within this kingdom
That therefore such a writ be sued against you
To forfeit all your goods lands tenements
Chattels and whatsoever and to be
How to live better For your stubborn answer
About the giving back the great seal to us
The King shall know it and no doubt shall thank you
So fare you well my little good Lord Cardinal
Exeunt all but WOLSEY
WOLSEY So farewell to the little good you bear me
Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him
The third day comes a frost a killing frost
And when he thinks good easy man full surely
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders
This many summers in a sea of glory
At length broke under me and now has left me
Weary and old with service to the mercy
Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me
Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye
There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to
That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin
More pangs and fears than wars or women have
And when he falls he falls like Lucifer
Never to hope again
Enter CROMWELL standing amazed
Why how now Cromwell
CROMWELL I have no power to speak sir
At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline Nay an you weep
CROMWELL How does your Grace
WOLSEY Why well
Never so truly happy my good Cromwell
I know myself now and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities
I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven
CROMWELL I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it
WOLSEY I hope I have I am able now methinks
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel
To endure more miseries and greater far
What news abroad
CROMWELL The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the King
WOLSEY God bless him
CROMWELL The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings
What more
CROMWELL Last that the Lady Anne
Whom the King hath in secrecy long married
Going to chapel and the voice is now
Only about her coronation
O Cromwell
The King has gone beyond me All my glories
In that one woman I have lost for ever
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles Go get thee from me Cromwell
To be thy lord and master Seek the King
That sun I pray may never set I have told him
What and how true thou art He will advance thee
Thy hopeful service perish too Good Cromwell
Neglect him not make use now and provide
For thine own future safety
CROMWELL O my lord
Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo
So good so noble and so true a master
Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord
The King shall have my service but my prayers
For ever and for ever shall be yours
WOLSEY Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear
Out of thy honest truth to play the woman
And when I am forgotten as I shall be
And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour
Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition
By that sin fell the angels How can man then
The image of his Maker hope to win by it
Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee
Corruption wins not more than honesty
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not
There take an inventory of all I have
And my integrity to heaven is all
I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell
Have left me naked to mine enemies
CROMWELL Good sir have patience
WOLSEY So I have Farewell
The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwell           Exeunt

THIRD GENTLEMAN As well as I am able The rich stream
Of lords and ladies having brought the Queen
A distance from her while her Grace sat down
To rest awhile some half an hour or so
In a rich chair of state opposing freely
The beauty of her person to the people
Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman
That ever lay by man which when the people
Had the full view of such a noise arose
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest
Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy
That had not half a week to go like rams
In the old time of war would shake the press
So strangely in one piece

ACT IV SCENE 2
Kimbolton
Enter KATHARINE Dowager sick led between GRIFFITH her Gentleman Usher
and PATIENCE her woman
GRIFFITH How does your Grace
KATHARINE O Griffith sick to death
Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair
That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey
Was dead
GRIFFITH Yes madam but I think your Grace
KATHARINE Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died
For my example
GRIFFITH Well the voice goes madam
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York and brought him forward
As a man sorely tainted to his answer
He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule
KATHARINE Alas poor man
GRIFFITH At last with easy roads he came to Leicester
An old man broken with the storms of state
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye
So went to bed where eagerly his sickness
Continual meditations tears and sorrows
He gave his honours to the world again
His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace
KATHARINE So may he rest his faults lie gently on him
Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him
And yet with charity He was a man
Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking
Himself with princes one that by suggestion
Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play
He would say untruths and be ever double
Both in his words and meaning He was never
But where he meant to ruin pitiful
His promises were as he then was mighty
But his performance as he is now nothing
Of his own body he was ill and gave
The clergy ill example
GRIFFITH Noble madam
We write in water May it please your Highness
To hear me speak his good now
KATHARINE Yes good Griffith
I were malicious else
GRIFFITH This Cardinal
Though from an humble stock undoubtedly
He was a scholar and a ripe and good one
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer
He was most princely ever witness for him
Ipswich and Oxford One of which fell with him
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it
So excellent in art and still so rising
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue
For then and not till then he felt himself
And found the blessedness of being little
And to add greater honours to his age
Than man could give him he died fearing God
KATHARINE After my death I wish no other herald
No other speaker of my living actions
To keep mine honour from corruption
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith
Whom I most hated living thou hast made me
With thy religious truth and modesty
Now in his ashes honour Peace be with him
patience be near me still and set me lower
I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith
Cause the musicians play me that sad note
On that celestial harmony I go to
For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience
THE VISION
Enter solemnly tripping one after another six
PERSONAGES clad in white robes wearing on their
heads garlands of bays and golden vizards on their
faces branches of bays or palm in their hands They
first congee unto her then dance and at certain
changes the first two hold a spare garland over her
head at which the other four make reverent curtsies
Then the two that held the garland deliver the
same to the other next two who observe the same
order in their changes and holding the garland over
her head which done they deliver the same garland
to the last two who likewise observe the same order
at which as it were by inspiration she makes
in her sleep signs of rejoicing and holdeth up her
hands to heaven And so in their dancing vanish
carrying the garland with them The music continues
KATHARINE Spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye
GRIFFITH Madam we are here
KATHARINE It is not you I call for
Saw ye none enter since I slept
GRIFFITH None madam
KATHARINE No Saw you not even now a blessed troop
Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces
Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun
And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel
I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly
GRIFFITH I am most joyful madam such good dreams
Possess your fancy
KATHARINE Bid the music leave
PATIENCE Do you note
How long her face is drawn How pale she looks
And of an earthly cold Mark her eyes
GRIFFITH She is going wench Pray pray
PATIENCE Heaven comfort her
Enter a MESSENGER
KATHARINE You are a saucy fellow
Deserve we no more reverence
GRIFFITH You are to blame
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness
To use so rude behaviour Go to kneel
My haste made me unmannerly There is staying
A gentleman sent from the King to see you
KATHARINE Admit him entrance Griffith but this fellow
Enter LORD CAPUCIUS
If my sight fail not
You should be Lord Ambassador from the Emperor
My royal nephew and your name Capucius
KATHARINE O my Lord
With me since first you knew me But I pray you
What is your pleasure with me
CAPUCIUS Noble lady
First mine own service to your Grace the next
Who grieves much for your weakness and by me
Sends you his princely commendations
And heartily entreats you take good comfort
KATHARINE O my good lord that comfort comes too late
But now I am past all comforts here but prayers
How does his Highness
CAPUCIUS Madam in good health
KATHARINE So may he ever do and ever flourish
When I shall dwell with worms and my poor name
KATHARINE Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver
This to my lord the King
CAPUCIUS Most willing madam
KATHARINE In which I have commended to his goodness
She is young and of a noble modest nature
Heaven knows how dearly My next poor petition
Is that his noble Grace would have some pity
Upon my wretched women that so long
For virtue and true beauty of the soul
For honesty and decent carriage
A right good husband let him be a noble
And something over to remember me by
And able means we had not parted thus
These are the whole contents and good my lord
By that you love the dearest in this world
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed
To do me this last right
CAPUCIUS By heaven I will
Or let me lose the fashion of a man
KATHARINE I thank you honest lord Remember me
In all humility unto his Highness
Say his long trouble now is passing
For so I will Mine eyes grow dim Farewell
My lord Griffith farewell Nay Patience
You must not leave me yet I must to bed
Call in more women When I am dead good wench
With maiden flowers that all the world may know
I was a chaste wife to my grave Embalm me
A queen and daughter to a king inter me
I can no more                          Exeunt leading KATHARINE

Good time and live but for the stock Sir Thomas

Which will require your answer you must take
Your patience to you and be well contented
It fits we thus proceed or else no witness

Most throughly to be winnowed where my chaff
And corn shall fly asunder for I know

In us thy friend Give me thy hand stand up
You would have given me your petition that
Yourself and your accusers and to have heard you
Without indurance further
CRANMER Most dread liege
The good I stand on is my truth and honesty
If they shall fail I with mine enemies
Being of those virtues vacant I fear nothing
What can be said against me
KING Know you not
Your enemies are many and not small their practices
Must bear the same proportion and not ever
Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
To swear against you Such things have been done
Of as great size Ween you of better luck
Upon this naughty earth Go to go to
You take a precipice for no leap of danger
And woo your own destruction
CRANMER God and your Majesty
Protect mine innocence or I fall into
The trap is laid for me
KING Be of good cheer
They shall no more prevail than we give way to
Keep comfort to you and this morning see
You do appear before them if they shall chance
In charging you with matters to commit you
The best persuasions to the contrary
Fail not to use and with what vehemency
Will render you no remedy this ring

CRANMER Why
Enter DOCTOR BUTTS
CRANMER So
I came this way so happily the King
Shall understand it presently                               Exit

Wait else at door a fellow councillor
Enter the KING and BUTTS at window above
BUTTS I think your Highness saw this many a day
KING Body a me where is it

The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury

ACT V SCENE 3
The Council Chamber
A Council table brought in with chairs and stools and placed
under the state Enter LORD CHANCELLOR places himself at the upper end
of the table on the left band a seat being left void above him
LORD CHAMBERLAIN GARDINER seat themselves in order on each side
CROMWELL at lower end as secretary KEEPER at the door
CHANCELLOR Speak to the business master secretary
Why are we met in council
CROMWELL Please your honours
The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury
GARDINER Has he had knowledge of it
CROMWELL Yes
NORFOLK Who waits there
KEEPER Without my noble lords
GARDINER Yes
KEEPER My Lord Archbishop
And has done half an hour to know your pleasures
CHANCELLOR Let him come in
KEEPER Your Grace may enter now
CRANMER approaches the Council table
CHANCELLOR My good Lord Archbishop I am very sorry
To sit here at this present and behold
That chair stand empty but we all are men
In our own natures frail and capable
Of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty
And want of wisdom you that best should teach us
Toward the King first then his laws in filling
Divers and dangerous which are heresies
GARDINER Which reformation must be sudden too
My noble lords for those that tame wild horses
Till they obey the manage If we suffer
Out of our easiness and childish pity
Farewell all physic and what follows then
Commotions uproars with a general taint
Of the whole state as of late days our neighbours
The upper Germany can dearly witness
Yet freshly pitied in our memories
CRANMER My good lords hitherto in all the progress
And with no little study that my teaching
And the strong course of my authority
Might go one way and safely and the end
A man that more detests more stirs against
Both in his private conscience and his place
Defacers of a public peace than I do
Pray heaven the King may never find a heart
With less allegiance in it Men that make
Envy and crooked malice nourishment
Dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships
That in this case of justice my accusers
Be what they will may stand forth face to face
And freely urge against me
SUFFOLK Nay my lord
That cannot be you are a councillor
And by that virtue no man dare accuse you
GARDINER My lord because we have business of more moment
And our consent for better trial of you
From hence you be committed to the Tower
Where being but a private man again
You shall know many dare accuse you boldly
More than I fear you are provided for
CRANMER Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you
You are always my good friend if your will pass
I shall both find your lordship judge and juror
Become a churchman better than ambition
Win straying souls with modesty again
Cast none away That I shall clear myself
Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience
I make as little doubt as you do conscience
In doing daily wrongs I could say more
But reverence to your calling makes me modest
GARDINER My lord my lord you are a sectary
To men that understand you words and weakness
By your good favour too sharp men so noble
However faulty yet should find respect
To load a falling man
GARDINER Good Master Secretary
I cry your honour mercy you may worst
Of all this table say so
CROMWELL Why my lord
GARDINER Do not I know you for a favourer
Of this new sect Ye are not sound
CROMWELL Not sound
GARDINER Not sound I say
CROMWELL Would you were half so honest
GARDINER I shall remember this bold language
CROMWELL Do
Remember your bold life too
CHANCELLOR This is too much
Forbear for shame my lords
GARDINER I have done
CROMWELL And I
CHANCELLOR Then thus for you my lord it stands agreed
I take it by all voices that forthwith
Be known unto us Are you all agreed lords
ALL We are
CRANMER Is there no other way of mercy
GARDINER What other
Would you expect You are strangely troublesome
Enter the guard
CRANMER For me
Must I go like a traitor thither
GARDINER Receive him
CRANMER Stay good my lords
I have a little yet to say Look there my lords
By virtue of that ring I take my cause
Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it
To a most noble judge the King my master
NORFOLK Do you think my lords
The King will suffer but the little finger
How much more is his life in value with him
CROMWELL My mind gave me
In seeking tales and informations
Ye blew the fire that burns ye Now have at ye
Enter the KING frowning on them he takes his seat
GARDINER Dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven
In daily thanks that gave us such a prince
Not only good and wise but most religious
One that in all obedience makes the church
The chief aim of his honour and to strengthen
That holy duty out of dear respect
His royal self in judgment comes to hear
The cause betwixt her and this great offender
KING You were ever good at sudden commendations
Bishop of Winchester But know I come not
To hear such flattery now and in my presence
They are too thin and bare to hide offences
To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel
And think with wagging of your tongue to win me
Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody
He that dares most but wag his finger at thee
Than but once think this place becomes thee not
KING No sir it does not please me
I had thought I had had men of some understanding
And wisdom of my Council but I find none
Was it discretion lords to let this man
This honest man wait like a lousy footboy
At chamber door and one as great as you are
Why what a shame was this Did my commission
Bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye
Power as he was a councillor to try him
More out of malice than integrity
Would try him to the utmost had ye mean
Which ye shall never have while I live
CHANCELLOR Thus far
My most dread sovereign may it like your Grace
And fair purgation to the world than malice
KING Well well my lords respect him
I will say thus much for him if a prince
May be beholding to a subject
Am for his love and service so to him
Make me no more ado but all embrace him
Be friends for shame my lords My Lord of Canterbury
I have a suit which you must not deny me
That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism
You must be godfather and answer for her
CRANMER The greatest monarch now alive may glory
In such an honour how may I deserve it
That am a poor and humble subject to you
shall have
Two noble partners with you the old Duchess of Norfolk
And Lady Marquis Dorset Will these please you
Once more my Lord of Winchester I charge you
Embrace and love this man
GARDINER With a true heart
CRANMER And let heaven
Witness how dear I hold this confirmation
KING Good man those joyful tears show thy true heart
The common voice I see is verified
Come lords we trifle time away I long
To have this young one made a Christian
As I have made ye one lords one remain
So I grow stronger you more honour gain                  Exeunt

MAN The spoons will be the bigger sir There is a fellow
somewhat near the door he should be a brazier by his
times on the head and three times was his nose discharged

she was quartered They fell on I made good my place
PORTER These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse
and fight for bitten apples that no audience but the tribulation
Patrum and there they are like to dance these three days
besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come
Enter the LORD CHAMBERLAIN
They grow still too from all parts they are coming
As if we kept a fair here Where are these porters
Great store of room no doubt left for the ladies
When they pass back from the christening
We are but men and what so many may do
Not being torn a pieces we have done
CHAMBERLAIN As I live
And here ye lie baiting of bombards when
Ye should do service Hark the trumpets sound
Go break among the press and find a way out
A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months

For heaven now bids me and the words I utter
Though in her cradle yet now promises
Upon this land a thousand blessings
A pattern to all princes living with her
And all that shall succeed Saba was never
More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
Than this pure soul shall be All princely graces
That mould up such a mighty piece as this is
With all the virtues that attend the good
Shall still be doubled on her Truth shall nurse her
Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her

Under his own vine what he plants and sing
The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours

From her shall read the perfect ways of honour
And by those claim their greatness not by blood
Nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when
The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
That were the servants to this chosen infant
Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him
Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine
His honour and the greatness of his name
Shall be and make new nations he shall flourish
And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
Shall see this and bless heaven
KING Thou speakest wonders
CRANMER She shall be to the happiness of England
An aged princess many days shall see her
And yet no day without a deed to crown it
A most unspotted lily shall she pass
KING O Lord Archbishop
Thou hast made me now a man never before
This happy child did I get anything
That when I am in heaven I shall desire
To see what this child does and praise my Maker
I thank ye all To you my good Lord Mayor
And you good brethren I am much beholding
And ye shall find me thankful Lead the way lords
Ye must all see the Queen and she must thank ye
She will be sick else This day no man think
Has business at his house for all shall stay
This little one shall make it holiday                     Exeunt
KING_HENRY_VIII|EPILOGUE
THE EPILOGUE
All that are here Some come to take their ease
And sleep an act or two but those we fear
Which we have not done neither that I fear
For this play at this time is only in
The merciful construction of good women

SCENE
England and France
ACT I SCENE 1
Enter KING JOHN QUEEN ELINOR PEMBROKE ESSEX SALISBURY and others
with CHATILLON
KING JOHN Now say Chatillon what would France with us
CHATILLON Thus after greeting speaks the King of France
In my behaviour to the majesty
The borrowed majesty of England here
KING JOHN Silence good mother hear the embassy
CHATILLON Philip of France in right and true behalf
Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim
To this fair island and the territories
To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
Which sways usurpingly these several titles
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign
KING JOHN What follows if we disallow of this
CHATILLON The proud control of fierce and bloody war
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld
KING JOHN Here have we war for war and blood for blood
The farthest limit of my embassy
KING JOHN Bear mine to him and so depart in peace
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France
For ere thou canst report I will be there
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard
So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
And sullen presage of your own decay
Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE
ELINOR What now my son Have I not ever said
How that ambitious Constance would not cease
Till she had kindled France and all the world
Upon the right and party of her son
This might have been prevented and made whole
With very easy arguments of love
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate
KING JOHN Our strong possession and our right for us
ELINOR Your strong possession much more than your right
Or else it must go wrong with you and me
So much my conscience whispers in your ear
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear
Enter a SHERIFF
ESSEX My liege here is the strangest controversy
KING JOHN Let them approach                          Exit SHERIFF
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP his bastard
brother
What men are you
BASTARD Your faithful subject I a gentleman
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son
KING JOHN What art thou
ROBERT The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge
KING JOHN Is that the elder and art thou the heir
You came not of one mother then it seems
But for the certain knowledge of that truth
ELINOR Out on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother
And wound her honour with this diffidence
At least from fair five hundred pound a year
KING JOHN A good blunt fellow Why being younger born
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance
BASTARD I know not why except to get the land
Compare our faces and be judge yourself
If old Sir Robert did beget us both
O old Sir Robert father on my knee
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee
KING JOHN Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here
The accent of his tongue affecteth him
Do you not read some tokens of my son
In the large composition of this man
KING JOHN Mine eye hath well examined his parts
And finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak
With half that face would he have all my land
BASTARD Well sir by this you cannot get my land
To Germany there with the Emperor
To treat of high affairs touching that time
But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores
Between my father and my mother lay
As I have heard my father speak himself
When this same lusty gentleman was got
His lands to me and took it on his death
And if he were he came into the world
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time
Then good my liege let me have what is mine
KING JOHN Sirrah your brother is legitimate
And if she did play false the fault was hers
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
That marry wives Tell me how if my brother
Who as you say took pains to get this son
In sooth good friend your father might have kept
This calf bred from his cow from all the world
My brother might not claim him nor your father
Being none of his refuse him This concludes
To dispossess that child which is not his
BASTARD Of no more force to dispossess me sir
Than was his will to get me as I think
ELINOR Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
And like thy brother to enjoy thy land
Lord of thy presence and no land beside
BASTARD Madam an if my brother had my shape
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
Would I might never stir from off this place
I would give it every foot to have this face
I would not be Sir Nob in any case
ELINOR I like thee well Wilt thou forsake thy fortune
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me
I am a soldier and now bound to France
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year
ELINOR Nay I would have you go before me thither
BASTARD Our country manners give our betters way
KING JOHN What is thy name
BASTARD Philip my liege so is my name begun
KING JOHN From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest
Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet
My father gave me honour yours gave land
Now blessed be the hour by night or day
When I was got Sir Robert was away
ELINOR The very spirit of Plantagenet
I am thy grandam Richard call me so
BASTARD Madam by chance but not by truth what though
Something about a little from the right
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night
And have is have however men do catch
Near or far off well won is still well shot
KING JOHN Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire
Come madam and come Richard we must speed
For France for France for it is more than need
BASTARD Brother adieu Good fortune come to thee
Exeunt all but the BASTARD
A foot of honour better than I was
But many a many foot of land the worse
Well now can I make any Joan a lady
For your conversion Now your traveller
Why then I suck my teeth and catechize
Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin
And then comes answer like an Absey book
And so ere answer knows what question would
Saving in dialogue of compliment
And talking of the Alps and Apennines
It draws toward supper in conclusion so
But this is worshipful society
And fits the mounting spirit like myself
For he is but a bastard to the time
And so am I whether I smack or no
And not alone in habit and device
Exterior form outward accoutrement
But from the inward motion to deliver
Which though I will not practise to deceive
Yet to avoid deceit I mean to learn
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising
That will take pains to blow a horn before her
Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and JAMES GURNEY
What brings you here to court so hastily
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Where is that slave thy brother
Where is he
That holds in chase mine honour up and down
Colbrand the giant that same mighty man
BASTARD James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile
GURNEY Good leave good Philip
Exit GURNEY
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
Could he get me Sir Robert could not do it
We know his handiwork Therefore good mother
To whom am I beholding for these limbs
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Hast thou conspired with thy brother too
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour
What means this scorn thou most untoward knave
Legitimation name and all is gone
Some proper man I hope Who was it mother
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge
BASTARD As faithfully as I deny the devil
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge
Thou art the issue of my dear offence
BASTARD Now by this light were I to get again
Madam I would not wish a better father
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth
And so doth yours your fault was not your folly
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose
Subjected tribute to commanding love
Against whose fury and unmatched force
The aweless lion could not wage the fight
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
With all my heart I thank thee for my father
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
Come lady I will show thee to my kin
And they shall say when Richard me begot
If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin

ACT II SCENE 1
France Before Angiers
Enter on one side AUSTRIA and forces on the other KING PHILIP OF FRANCE
LEWIS the Dauphin CONSTANCE ARTHUR and forces
KING PHILIP Before Angiers well met brave Austria
Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood
And fought the holy wars in Palestine
By this brave duke came early to his grave
And for amends to his posterity
At our importance hither is he come
To spread his colours boy in thy behalf
And to rebuke the usurpation
Of thy unnatural uncle English John
Embrace him love him give him welcome hither
The rather that you give his offspring life
Shadowing their right under your wings of war
I give you welcome with a powerless hand
But with a heart full of unstained love
Welcome before the gates of Angiers Duke
KING PHILIP A noble boy Who would not do thee right
AUSTRIA Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
As seal to this indenture of my love
That to my home I will no more return
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France
Even till that utmost corner of the west
Salute thee for her king Till then fair boy
Will I not think of home but follow arms
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
To make a more requital to your love
AUSTRIA The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
In such a just and charitable war
KING PHILIP Well then to work Our cannon shall be bent
Against the brows of this resisting town
Call for our chiefest men of discipline
To cull the plots of best advantages
But we will make it subject to this boy
CONSTANCE Stay for an answer to your embassy
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring
That right in peace which here we urge in war
And then we shall repent each drop of blood
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed
Enter CHATILLON
KING PHILIP A wonder lady Lo upon thy wish
What England says say briefly gentle lord
We coldly pause for thee Chatillon speak
CHATILLON Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
And stir them up against a mightier task
England impatient of your just demands
Hath put himself in arms The adverse winds
To land his legions all as soon as I
His marches are expedient to this town
His forces strong his soldiers confident
An Ate stirring him to blood and strife
With her the Lady Blanch of Spain
Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs
To make a hazard of new fortunes here
In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits
Did never float upon the swelling tide
The interruption of their churlish drums
Cuts off more circumstance they are at hand
To parley or to fight therefore prepare
AUSTRIA By how much unexpected by so much
We must awake endeavour for defence
For courage mounteth with occasion
Enter KING JOHN ELINOR BLANCH the BASTARD
PEMBROKE and others
KING JOHN Peace be to France if France in peace permit
Our just and lineal entrance to our own
If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven
KING PHILIP Peace be to England if that war return
From France to England there to live in peace
With burden of our armour here we sweat
This toil of ours should be a work of thine
But thou from loving England art so far
Cut off the sequence of posterity
Outfaced infant state and done a rape
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown
These eyes these brows were moulded out of his
This little abstract doth contain that large
Which died in Geffrey and the hand of time
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born
When living blood doth in these temples beat
KING JOHN From whom hast thou this great commission France
To draw my answer from thy articles
KING PHILIP From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
In any breast of strong authority
To look into the blots and stains of right
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
And by whose help I mean to chastise it
KING JOHN Alack thou dost usurp authority
KING PHILIP Excuse it is to beat usurping down
ELINOR Who is it thou dost call usurper France
CONSTANCE Let me make answer thy usurping son
ELINOR Out insolent Thy bastard shall be king
That thou mayst be a queen and check the world
CONSTANCE My bed was ever to thy son as true
As thine was to thy husband and this boy
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
As rain to water or devil to his dam
My boy a bastard By my soul I think
His father never was so true begot
It cannot be an if thou wert his mother
AUSTRIA Peace
BASTARD Hear the crier
AUSTRIA What the devil art thou
BASTARD One that will play the devil sir with you
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard
That did disrobe the lion of that robe
BASTARD It lies as sightly on the back of him
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack
AUSTRIA What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
With this abundance of superfluous breath
King Philip determine what we shall do straight
KING PHILIP Women and fools break off your conference
King John this is the very sum of all
England and Ireland Anjou Touraine Maine
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms
KING JOHN My life as soon I do defy thee France
Arthur of Britaine yield thee to my hand
Submit thee boy
ELINOR Come to thy grandam child
CONSTANCE Do child go to it grandam child
Give grandam kingdom and it grandam will
Give it a plum a cherry and a fig
ARTHUR Good my mother peace
I would that I were low laid in my grave
ELINOR His mother shames him so poor boy he weeps
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee
To do him justice and revenge on you
ELINOR Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth
CONSTANCE Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth
Call not me slanderer Thou and thine usurp
The dominations royalties and rights
Infortunate in nothing but in thee
Thy sins are visited in this poor child
The canon of the law is laid on him
Being but the second generation
KING JOHN Bedlam have done
That he is not only plagued for her sin
But God hath made her sin and her the plague
On this removed issue plagued for her
And with her plague her sin his injury
Her injury the beadle to her sin
ELINOR Thou unadvised scold I can produce
A will that bars the title of thy son
CONSTANCE Ay who doubts that A will a wicked will
KING PHILIP Peace lady pause or be more temperate
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
These men of Angiers let us hear them speak
Trumpet sounds Enter citizens upon the walls
KING JOHN England for itself
KING JOHN For our advantage therefore hear us first
These flags of France that are advanced here
Before the eye and prospect of your town
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath
And ready mounted are they to spit forth
All preparation for a bloody siege
And merciless proceeding by these French
And but for our approach those sleeping stones
That as a waist doth girdle you about
By the compulsion of their ordinance
By this time from their fixed beds of lime
Had been dishabited and wide havoc made
For bloody power to rush upon your peace
But on the sight of us your lawful king
Who painfully with much expedient march
Have brought a countercheck before your gates
To make a shaking fever in your walls
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke
To make a faithless error in your cars
Which trust accordingly kind citizens
Forwearied in this action of swift speed
Craves harbourage within your city walls
KING PHILIP When I have said make answer to us both
Lo in this right hand whose protection
Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet
Son to the elder brother of this man
In warlike march these greens before your town
Being no further enemy to you
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
In the relief of this oppressed child
Religiously provokes Be pleased then
To pay that duty which you truly owe
To him that owes it namely this young prince
And then our arms like to a muzzled bear
We will bear home that lusty blood again
Which here we came to spout against your town
And leave your children wives and you in peace
Can hide you from our messengers of war
Though all these English and their discipline
Then tell us shall your city call us lord
Or shall we give the signal to our rage
And stalk in blood to our possession
For him and in his right we hold this town
KING JOHN Acknowledge then the King and let me in
CITIZEN That can we not but he that proves the King
To him will we prove loyal Till that time
KING JOHN Doth not the crown of England prove the King
And if not that I bring you witnesses
BASTARD Bastards and else
KING JOHN To verify our title with their lives
BASTARD Some bastards too
KING PHILIP Stand in his face to contradict his claim
CITIZEN Till you compound whose right is worthiest
We for the worthiest hold the right from both
KING JOHN Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
That to their everlasting residence
Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet
KING PHILIP Amen Amen Mount chevaliers to arms
At your den sirrah with your lioness
And make a monster of you
AUSTRIA Peace no more
BASTARD O tremble for you hear the lion roar
In best appointment all our regiments
BASTARD Speed then to take advantage of the field
KING PHILIP It shall be so and at the other hill
Command the rest to stand God and our right              Exeunt
Here after excursions enter the HERALD OF FRANCE
with trumpets to the gates
FRENCH HERALD You men of Angiers open wide your gates
And let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in
Who by the hand of France this day hath made
Much work for tears in many an English mother
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground
Coldly embracing the discoloured earth
And victory with little loss doth play
Upon the dancing banners of the French
Who are at hand triumphantly displayed
To enter conquerors and to proclaim
Enter ENGLISH HERALD with trumpet
ENGLISH HERALD Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells
Commander of this hot malicious day
There stuck no plume in any English crest
That is removed by a staff of France
Our colours do return in those same hands
And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
Our lusty English all with purpled hands
Open your gates and give the victors way
From first to last the onset and retire
Of both your armies whose equality
By our best eyes cannot be censured
Both are alike and both alike we like
One must prove greatest While they weigh so even
We hold our town for neither yet for both
Enter the two KINGS with their powers at several doors
KING JOHN France hast thou yet more blood to cast away
Say shall the current of our right run on
Unless thou let his silver water keep
A peaceful progress to the ocean
In this hot trial more than we of France
Rather lost more And by this hand I swear
That sways the earth this climate overlooks
Or add a royal number to the dead
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire
O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel
The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs
And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus
You equal potents fiery kindled spirits
Then let confusion of one part confirm
KING JOHN Whose party do the townsmen yet admit
CITIZEN The King of England when we know the King
KING PHILIP Know him in us that here hold up his right
KING JOHN In us that are our own great deputy
And bear possession of our person here
Lord of our presence Angiers and of you
And till it be undoubted we do lock
BASTARD By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings
And stand securely on their battlements
As in a theatre whence they gape and point
At your industrious scenes and acts of death
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town
By east and west let France and England mount
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city
Even till unfenced desolation
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air
That done dissever your united strengths
And part your mingled colours once again
Turn face to face and bloody point to point
Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth
Out of one side her happy minion
To whom in favour she shall give the day
And kiss him with a glorious victory
How like you this wild counsel mighty states
Smacks it not something of the policy
KING JOHN Now by the sky that hangs above our heads
And lay this Angiers even with the ground
Then after fight who shall be king of it
BASTARD An if thou hast the mettle of a king
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery
As we will ours against these saucy walls
Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell
KING PHILIP Let it be so Say where will you assault
KING JOHN We from the west will send destruction
AUSTRIA I from the north
KING PHILIP Our thunder from the south
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town
CITIZEN Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay
Win you this city without stroke or wound
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds
That here come sacrifices for the field
Persever not but hear me mighty kings
KING JOHN Speak on with favour we are bent to hear
CITIZEN That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch
Is niece to England look upon the years
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch
If zealous love should go in search of virtue
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch
If love ambitious sought a match of birth
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch
Such as she is in beauty virtue birth
If not complete of say he is not she
And she again wants nothing to name want
If want it be not that she is not he
He is the half part of a blessed man
Left to be finished by such as she
And she a fair divided excellence
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him
O two such silver currents when they join
Do glorify the banks that bound them in
And two such shores to two such streams made one
Two such controlling bounds shall you be Kings
To these two princes if you marry them
This union shall do more than battery can
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope
And give you entrance but without this match
The sea enraged is not half so deaf
Lions more confident mountains and rocks
In mortal fury half so peremptory
As we to keep this city
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood
He gives the bastinado with his tongue
But buffets better than a fist of France
ELINOR Son list to this conjunction make this match
Give with our niece a dowry large enough
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit
I see a yielding in the looks of France
Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls
Are capable of this ambition
Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath
Of soft petitions pity and remorse
Cool and congeal again to what it was
CITIZEN Why answer not the double majesties
KING PHILIP Speak England first that hath been forward first
To speak unto this city what say you
KING JOHN If that the Dauphin there thy princely son
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen
For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers
Find liable to our crown and dignity
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
In titles honours and promotions
As she in beauty education blood
Holds hand with any princess of the world
LEWIS I do my lord and in her eye I find
A wonder or a wondrous miracle
Which being but the shadow of your son
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow
Till now infixed I beheld myself
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye
In such a love so vile a lout as he
If he see aught in you that makes him like
That anything he sees which moves his liking
I can with ease translate it to my will
Or if you will to speak more properly
Further I will not flatter you my lord
That all I see in you is worthy love
That I can find should merit any hate
KING JOHN What say these young ones What say you my niece
BLANCH That she is bound in honour still to do
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say
KING JOHN Speak then Prince Dauphin can you love this lady
LEWIS Nay ask me if I can refrain from love
For I do love her most unfeignedly
KING JOHN Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine
Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces
With her to thee and this addition more
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin
Command thy son and daughter to join hands
KING PHILIP It likes us well young princes close your hands
KING PHILIP Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates
Let in that amity which you have made
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop
I know she is not for this match made up
Her presence would have interrupted much
Where is she and her son Tell me who knows
KING PHILIP And by my faith this league that we have made
Will give her sadness very little cure
Brother of England how may we content
This widow lady In her right we came
To our own vantage
KING JOHN We will heal up all
And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town
We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance
Some speedy messenger bid her repair
To our solemnity I trust we shall
If not fill up the measure of her will
Yet in some measure satisfy her so
That we shall stop her exclamation
Go we as well as haste will suffer us
Exeunt all but the BASTARD
BASTARD Mad world mad kings mad composition
Hath willingly departed with a part
And France whose armour conscience buckled on
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
That broker that still breaks the pate of faith
Of kings of beggars old men young men maids
Who having no external thing to lose
The world who of itself is peised well
Made to run even upon even ground
This sway of motion this commodity
Makes it take head from all indifferency
And this same bias this commodity
And why rail I on this commodity
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
When his fair angels would salute my palm
But for my hand as unattempted yet
Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich
Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail
And say there is no sin but to be rich
And being rich my virtue then shall be
To say there is no vice but beggary
Since kings break faith upon commodity
Gain be my lord for I will worship thee                   Exit

ACT III SCENE 1
Enter CONSTANCE ARTHUR and SALISBURY
CONSTANCE Gone to be married Gone to swear a peace
Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces
It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard
I trust I may not trust thee for thy word
Is but the vain breath of a common man
Believe me I do not believe thee man
For I am sick and capable of fears
A widow husbandless subject to fears
A woman naturally born to fears
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest
But they will quake and tremble all this day
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son
What means that hand upon that breast of thine
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words
But this one word whether thy tale be true
SALISBURY As true as I believe you think them false
That give you cause to prove my saying true
CONSTANCE O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die
And let belief and life encounter so
As doth the fury of two desperate men
Which in the very meeting fall and die
Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou
France friend with England what becomes of me
Fellow be gone I cannot brook thy sight
This news hath made thee a most ugly man
SALISBURY What other harm have I good lady done
But spoke the harm that is by others done
CONSTANCE Which harm within itself so heinous is
As it makes harmful all that speak of it
ARTHUR I do beseech you madam be content
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains
Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious
I would not care I then would be content
For then I should not love thee no nor thou
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown
But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs
That strumpet Fortune that usurping John
Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn
Envenom him with words or get thee gone
And leave those woes alone which I alone
SALISBURY Pardon me madam
I may not go without you to the kings
CONSTANCE Thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop
To me and to the state of my great grief
That no supporter but the huge firm earth
Here I and sorrows sit
Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it
Enter KING JOHN KING PHILIP LEWIS BLANCH
ELINOR the BASTARD AUSTRIA and attendants
Ever in France shall be kept festival
To solemnize this day the glorious sun
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist
Turning with splendour of his precious eye
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold
The yearly course that brings this day about
Shall never see it but a holiday
That it in golden letters should be set
Among the high tides in the calendar
Nay rather turn this day out of the week
This day of shame oppression perjury
Or if it must stand still let wives with child
Pray that their burdens may not fall this day
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck
No bargains break that are not this day made
This day all things begun come to ill end
Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change
KING PHILIP By heaven lady you shall have no cause
To curse the fair proceedings of this day
Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
Is cold in amity and painted peace
And our oppression hath made up this league
A widow cries Be husband to me heavens
Let not the hours of this ungodly day
Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset
Hear me O hear me
AUSTRIA Lady Constance peace
CONSTANCE War war no peace Peace is to me a war
O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame
That bloody spoil Thou slave thou wretch thou coward
Thou little valiant great in villainy
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side
But when her humorous ladyship is by
A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side
Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend
Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength
And dost thou now fall over to my foes
AUSTRIA O that a man should speak those words to me
KING JOHN We like not this thou dost forget thyself
Enter PANDULPH
KING PHILIP Here comes the holy legate of the Pope
PANDULPH Hail you anointed deputies of heaven
To thee King John my holy errand is
I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal
And from Pope Innocent the legate here
Do in his name religiously demand
Why thou against the Church our holy mother
So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce
Keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop
Of Canterbury from that holy see
Pope Innocent I do demand of thee
KING JOHN What earthly name to interrogatories
Can task the free breath of a sacred king
Thou canst not Cardinal devise a name
So slight unworthy and ridiculous
To charge me to an answer as the Pope
Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England
Add thus much more that no Italian priest
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions
But as we under heaven are supreme head
So under Him that great supremacy
Where we do reign we will alone uphold
So tell the Pope all reverence set apart
KING PHILIP Brother of England you blaspheme in this
KING JOHN Though you and all the kings of Christendom
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest
Dreading the curse that money may buy out
And by the merit of vile gold dross dust
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
Though you and all the rest so grossly led
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish
Yet I alone alone do me oppose
Against the Pope and count his friends my foes
PANDULPH Then by the lawful power that I have
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
From his allegiance to an heretic
That takes away by any secret course
Thy hateful life
CONSTANCE O lawful let it be
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile
To my keen curses for without my wrong
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right
CONSTANCE And for mine too when law can do no right
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law
Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse
PANDULPH Philip of France on peril of a curse
And raise the power of France upon his head
Unless he do submit himself to Rome
CONSTANCE Look to that devil lest that France repent
And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul
AUSTRIA King Philip listen to the Cardinal
AUSTRIA Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs
BASTARD Your breeches best may carry them
CONSTANCE What should he say but as the Cardinal
LEWIS Bethink you father for the difference
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome
Or the light loss of England for a friend
Forgo the easier
CONSTANCE O Lewis stand fast The devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride
BLANCH The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith
But from her need
CONSTANCE O if thou grant my need
Which only lives but by the death of faith
That faith would live again by death of need
O then tread down my need and faith mounts up
Keep my need up and faith is trodden down
AUSTRIA Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt
PANDULPH What canst thou say but will perplex thee more
KING PHILIP Good reverend father make my person yours
And tell me how you would bestow yourself
This royal hand and mine are newly knit
And the conjunction of our inward souls
With all religious strength of sacred vows
The latest breath that gave the sound of words
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves
And even before this truce but new before
No longer than we well could wash our hands
To clap this royal bargain up of peace
The fearful difference of incensed kings
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet
Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven
Make such unconstant children of ourselves
As now again to snatch our palm from palm
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host
And make a riot on the gentle brow
Of true sincerity O holy sir
My reverend father let it not be so
Out of your grace devise ordain impose
Some gentle order and then we shall be blest
To do your pleasure and continue friends
PANDULPH All form is formless order orderless
Therefore to arms be champion of our church
France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue
A chafed lion by the mortal paw
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold
KING PHILIP I may disjoin my hand but not my faith
Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow
That is to be the champion of our Church
And may not be performed by thyself
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
Is not amiss when it is truly done
And being not done where doing tends to ill
The truth is then most done not doing it
The better act of purposes mistook
Is to mistake again though indirect
Yet indirection thereby grows direct
And falsehood cures as fire cools fire
It is religion that doth make vows kept
But thou hast sworn against religion
Against an oath the truth thou art unsure
To swear swears only not to be forsworn
Else what a mockery should it be to swear
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn
And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear
Therefore thy later vows against thy first
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself
And better conquest never canst thou make
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
Against these giddy loose suggestions
If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know
The peril of our curses fight on thee
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off
But in despair die under the black weight
AUSTRIA Rebellion flat rebellion
LEWIS Father to arms
Against the blood that thou hast married
What shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men
Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums
Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp
O husband hear me ay alack how new
Upon my knee I beg go not to arms
Against mine uncle
CONSTANCE O upon my knee
Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee
Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom
Forethought by heaven
BLANCH Now shall I see thy love What motive may
Be stronger with thee than the name of wife
CONSTANCE That which upholdeth him that thee upholds
His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour
LEWIS I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold
When such profound respects do pull you on
PANDULPH I will denounce a curse upon his head
KING PHILIP Thou shalt not need England I will fall from thee
ELINOR O foul revolt of French inconstancy
KING JOHN France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour
Is it as he will Well then France shall rue
Which is the side that I must go withal
I am with both each army hath a hand
And in their rage I having hold of both
They whirl asunder and dismember me
Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst win
Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose
Father I may not wish the fortune thine
Grandam I will not wish thy wishes thrive
Whoever wins on that side shall I lose
LEWIS Lady with me with me thy fortune lies
BLANCH There where my fortune lives there my life dies
KING JOHN Cousin go draw our puissance together
Exit BASTARD
A rage whose heat hath this condition
That nothing can allay nothing but blood
KING PHILIP Thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn
To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire
Look to thyself thou art in jeopardy
Exeunt severally
SCENE 2
France Plains near Angiers
BASTARD Now by my life this day grows wondrous hot
Some airy devil hovers in the sky
While Philip breathes
Enter KING JOHN ARTHUR and HUBERT
KING JOHN Hubert keep this boy Philip make up
My mother is assailed in our tent
BASTARD My lord I rescued her
Her Highness is in safety fear you not
But on my liege for very little pains
Will bring this labour to an happy end                    Exeunt
SCENE 3
France Plains near Angiers
Alarums excursions retreat Enter KING JOHN ELINOR ARTHUR
the BASTARD HUBERT and LORDS
behind
Thy grandam loves thee and thy uncle will
As dear be to thee as thy father was
ARTHUR O this will make my mother die with grief
before
And ere our coming see thou shake the bags
Of hoarding abbots imprisoned angels
Set at liberty the fat ribs of peace
Must by the hungry now be fed upon
Use our commission in his utmost force
BASTARD Bell book and candle shall not drive me back
When gold and silver becks me to come on
I leave your Highness Grandam I will pray
If ever I remember to be holy
For your fair safety So I kiss your hand
ELINOR Farewell gentle cousin
KING JOHN Coz farewell
Exit BASTARD
ELINOR Come hither little kinsman hark a word
KING JOHN Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert
We owe thee much Within this wall of flesh
There is a soul counts thee her creditor
And with advantage means to pay thy love
And my good friend thy voluntary oath
Lives in this bosom dearly cherished
But I will fit it with some better time
To say what good respect I have of thee
HUBERT I am much bounden to your Majesty
KING JOHN Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good
The sun is in the heaven and the proud day
Attended with the pleasures of the world
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
To give me audience If the midnight bell
Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
Sound on into the drowsy race of night
If this same were a churchyard where we stand
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs
Or if that surly spirit melancholy
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment
A passion hateful to my purposes
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes
Hear me without thine cars and make reply
Without a tongue using conceit alone
Then in despite of brooded watchful day
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts
But ah I will not Yet I love thee well
HUBERT So well that what you bid me undertake
Though that my death were adjunct to my act
By heaven I would do it
KING JOHN Do not I know thou wouldst
Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye
He is a very serpent in my way
He lies before me Dost thou understand me
Thou art his keeper
That he shall not offend your Majesty
KING JOHN Death
HUBERT My lord
KING JOHN A grave
HUBERT He shall not live
KING JOHN Enough
I could be merry now Hubert I love thee
Remember Madam fare you well
ELINOR My blessing go with thee
Hubert shall be your man attend on you
With all true duty On toward Calais ho                  Exeunt
SCENE 4
Enter KING PHILIP LEWIS PANDULPH and attendants
KING PHILIP So by a roaring tempest on the flood
A whole armado of convicted sail
PANDULPH Courage and comfort All shall yet go well
KING PHILIP What can go well when we have run so ill
Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost
And bloody England into England gone
LEWIS he hath won that hath he fortified
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause
Doth want example who hath read or heard
Of any kindred action like to this
KING PHILIP Well could I bear that England had this praise
So we could find some pattern of our shame
Enter CONSTANCE
Look who comes here a grave unto a soul
In the vile prison of afflicted breath
I prithee lady go away with me
CONSTANCE Lo now now see the issue of your peace
KING PHILIP Patience good lady Comfort gentle Constance
CONSTANCE No I defy all counsel all redress
Death death O amiable lovely death
Thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night
Thou hate and terror to prosperity
And I will kiss thy detestable bones
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
And ring these fingers with thy household worms
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
And be a carrion monster like thyself
O come to me
KING PHILIP O fair affliction peace
CONSTANCE No no I will not having breath to cry
Then with a passion would I shake the world
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
Which scorns a modern invocation
PANDULPH Lady you utter madness and not sorrow
CONSTANCE Thou art not holy to belie me so
I am not mad this hair I tear is mine
Young Arthur is my son and he is lost
O if I could what grief should I forget
Preach some philosophy to make me mad
For being not mad but sensible of grief
My reasonable part produces reason
And teaches me to kill or hang myself
If I were mad I should forget my son
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he
I am not mad too well too well I feel
The different plague of each calamity
KING PHILIP Bind up those tresses O what love I note
In the fair multitude of those her hairs
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
Do glue themselves in sociable grief
Like true inseparable faithful loves
Sticking together in calamity
CONSTANCE To England if you will
KING PHILIP Bind up your hairs
CONSTANCE Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
But now I envy at their liberty
And will again commit them to their bonds
Because my poor child is a prisoner
And father Cardinal I have heard you say
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven
If that be true I shall see my boy again
For since the birth of Cain the first male child
To him that did but yesterday suspire
There was not such a gracious creature born
But now will canker sorrow eat my bud
And chase the native beauty from his cheek
And he will look as hollow as a ghost
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
I shall not know him Therefore never never
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more
PANDULPH You hold too heinous a respect of grief
CONSTANCE He talks to me that never had a son
KING PHILIP You are as fond of grief as of your child
CONSTANCE Grief fills the room up of my absent child
Lies in his bed walks up and down with me
Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words
Remembers me of all his gracious parts
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form
Then have I reason to be fond of grief
Fare you well had you such a loss as I
I could give better comfort than you do
I will not keep this form upon my head
When there is such disorder in my wit
O Lord my boy my Arthur my fair son
My life my joy my food my ail the world
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness
PANDULPH Before the curing of a strong disease
Even in the instant of repair and health
The fit is strongest evils that take leave
On their departure most of all show evil
What have you lost by losing of this day
LEWIS All days of glory joy and happiness
PANDULPH If you had won it certainly you had
No no when Fortune means to men most good
In this which he accounts so clearly won
LEWIS As heartily as he is glad he hath him
PANDULPH Your mind is all as youthful as your blood
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit
For even the breath of what I mean to speak
Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub
Out of the path which shall directly lead
One minute nay one quiet breath of rest
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up
That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall
So be it for it cannot be but so
PANDULPH You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife
May then make all the claim that Arthur did
LEWIS And lose it life and all as Arthur did
PANDULPH How green you are and fresh in this old world
John lays you plots the times conspire with you
For he that steeps his safety in true blood
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue
This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal
That none so small advantage shall step forth
To check his reign but they will cherish it
No natural exhalation in the sky
No common wind no customed event
But they will pluck away his natural cause
And call them meteors prodigies and signs
Abortives presages and tongues of heaven
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John
But hold himself safe in his prisonment
PANDULPH O Sir when he shall hear of your approach
If that young Arthur be not gone already
Even at that news he dies and then the hearts
Of all his people shall revolt from him
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot
And O what better matter breeds for you
Is now in England ransacking the Church
Offending charity if but a dozen French
Were there in arms they would be as a can
To train ten thousand English to their side
Or as a little snow tumbled about
Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin
What may be wrought out of their discontent
Now that their souls are topful of offence
For England go I will whet on the King
LEWIS Strong reasons makes strong actions Let us go
If you say ay the King will not say no                   Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE 1
England A castle
Enter HUBERT and EXECUTIONERS
HUBERT Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand
Within the arras When I strike my foot
Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth
And bind the boy which you shall find with me
Fast to the chair Be heedful hence and watch
EXECUTIONER I hope your warrant will bear out the deed
Exeunt EXECUTIONERS
Young lad come forth I have to say with you
Enter ARTHUR
ARTHUR Good morrow Hubert
HUBERT Good morrow little Prince
ARTHUR As little prince having so great a tide
To be more prince as may be You are sad
HUBERT Indeed I have been merrier
ARTHUR Mercy on me
Methinks no body should be sad but I
Yet I remember when I was in France
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night
Only for wantonness By my christendom
So I were out of prison and kept sheep
I should be as merry as the day is long
And so I would be here but that I doubt
My uncle practises more harm to me
He is afraid of me and I of him
No indeed ist not and I would to heaven
I were your son so you would love me Hubert
He will awake my mercy which lies dead
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch
In sooth I would you were a little sick
That I might sit all night and watch with you
I warrant I love you more than you do me
Turning dispiteous torture out of door
I must be brief lest resolution drop
Can you not read it Is it not fair writ
ARTHUR Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes
HUBERT Young boy I must
ARTHUR And will you
HUBERT And I will
ARTHUR Have you the heart When your head did but ache
And I did never ask it you again
And with my hand at midnight held your head
And like the watchful minutes to the hour
But you at your sick service had a prince
Nay you may think my love was crafty love
And call it cunning Do an if you will
Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes
These eyes that never did nor never shall
So much as frown on you
HUBERT I have sworn to do it
And with hot irons must I burn them out
ARTHUR Ah none but in this iron age would do it
Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears
And quench his fiery indignation
Even in the matter of mine innocence
Nay after that consume away in rust
But for containing fire to harm mine eye
An if an angel should have come to me
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes
Do as I bid you do
ARTHUR O save me Hubert save me My eyes are out
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men
HUBERT Give me the iron I say and bind him here
For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound
Nay hear me Hubert Drive these men away
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb
I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word
Nor look upon the iron angrily
Whatever torment you do put me to
HUBERT Go stand within let me alone with him
Exeunt EXECUTIONERS
ARTHUR Alas I then have chid away my friend
He hath a stern look but a gentle heart
Let him come back that his compassion may
Give life to yours
HUBERT Come boy prepare yourself
ARTHUR Is there no remedy
HUBERT None but to lose your eyes
ARTHUR O heaven that there were but a mote in yours
A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair
Any annoyance in that precious sense
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible
HUBERT Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue
ARTHUR Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes
Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert
Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue
So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes
Though to no use but still to look on you
Lo by my troth the instrument is cold
And would not harm me
HUBERT I can heat it boy
ARTHUR No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief
In undeserved extremes See else yourself
There is no malice in this burning coal
The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out
HUBERT But with my breath I can revive it boy
ARTHUR An if you do you will but make it blush
And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert
Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on
All things that you should use to do me wrong
Deny their office only you do lack
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends
HUBERT Well see to live I will not touch thine eye
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes
Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy
With this same very iron to burn them out
ARTHUR O now you look like Hubert All this while
HUBERT Peace no more Adieu
Your uncle must not know but you are dead
And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure
That Hubert for the wealth of all the world
Will not offend thee
ARTHUR O heaven I thank you Hubert
HUBERT Silence no more Go closely in with me
Much danger do I undergo for thee                         Exeunt
SCENE 2
Enter KING JOHN PEMBROKE SALISBURY and other LORDS
Fresh expectation troubled not the land
To guard a title that was rich before
To gild refined gold to paint the lily
To throw a perfume on the violet
To smooth the ice or add another hue
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess
PEMBROKE But that your royal pleasure must be done
This act is as an ancient tale new told
And in the last repeating troublesome
Being urged at a time unseasonable
Of plain old form is much disfigured
And like a shifted wind unto a sail
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about
Startles and frights consideration
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected
PEMBROKE When workmen strive to do better than well
They do confound their skill in covetousness
And oftentimes excusing of a fault
As patches set upon a little breach
Discredit more in hiding of the fault
Since all and every part of what we would
Doth make a stand at what your Highness will
KING JOHN Some reasons of this double coronation
And more more strong when lesser is my fear
I shall indue you with Meantime but ask
And well shall you perceive how willingly
I will both hear and grant you your requests
PEMBROKE Then I as one that am the tongue of these
To sound the purposes of all their hearts
Your safety for the which myself and them
Bend their best studies heartily request
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
To break into this dangerous argument
If what in rest you have in right you hold
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
The rich advantage of good exercise
To grace occasions let it be our suit
That you have bid us ask his liberty
Which for our goods we do no further ask
Than whereupon our weal on you depending
Counts it your weal he have his liberty
KING JOHN Let it be so I do commit his youth
To your direction
Enter HUBERT
PEMBROKE This is the man should do the bloody deed
The image of a wicked heinous fault
Lives in his eye that close aspect of his
Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast
SALISBURY The colour of the King doth come and go
Between his purpose and his conscience
His passion is so ripe it needs must break
PEMBROKE And when it breaks I fear will issue thence
Good lords although my will to give is living
The suit which you demand is gone and dead
PEMBROKE Indeed we heard how near his death he was
Before the child himself felt he was sick
KING JOHN Why do you bend such solemn brows on me
Think you I bear the shears of destiny
Have I commandment on the pulse of life
That greatness should so grossly offer it
So thrive it in your game and so farewell
His little kingdom of a forced grave
This must not be thus borne this will break out
To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt            Exeunt LORDS
KING JOHN They burn in indignation I repent
There is no sure foundation set on blood
Enter a MESSENGER
A fearful eye thou hast where is that blood
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks
So foul a sky clears not without a storm
For any foreign preparation
Was levied in the body of a land
For when you should be told they do prepare
KING JOHN O where hath our intelligence been drunk
That such an army could be drawn in France
And she not hear of it
MESSENGER My liege her ear
Your noble mother and as I hear my lord
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
KING JOHN Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion
My discontented peers What mother dead
How wildly then walks my estate in France
MESSENGER Under the Dauphin
KING JOHN Thou hast made me giddy
With these in tidings
Enter the BASTARD and PETER OF POMFRET
Now What says the world
To your proceedings Do not seek to stuff
My head with more ill news for it is fun
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head
Under the tide but now I breathe again
Aloft the flood and can give audience
To any tongue speak it of what it will
BASTARD How I have sped among the clergymen
The sums I have collected shall express
I find the people strangely fantasied
Not knowing what they fear but full of fear
From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found
With many hundreds treading on his heels
Your Highness should deliver up your crown
KING JOHN Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so
PETER Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so
KING JOHN Hubert away with him imprison him
And on that day at noon whereon he says
Deliver him to safety and return
For I must use thee
Exit HUBERT with PETER
O my gentle cousin
Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury
And others more going to seek the grave
On your suggestion
KING JOHN Gentle kinsman go
And thrust thyself into their companies
I have a way to will their loves again
Bring them before me
BASTARD I Will seek them out
KING JOHN Nay but make haste the better foot before
O let me have no subject enemies
When adverse foreigners affright my towns
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion
Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels
And fly like thought from them to me again
BASTARD The spirit of the time shall teach me speed
KING JOHN Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman
Exit BASTARD
Go after him for he perhaps shall need
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers
And be thou he
MESSENGER With all my heart my liege                        Exit
KING JOHN My mother dead
Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about
The other four in wondrous motion
KING JOHN Five moons
HUBERT Old men and beldams in the streets
Do prophesy upon it dangerously
And when they talk of him they shake their heads
And whisper one another in the ear
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes
I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool
Who with his shears and measure in his hand
Standing on slippers which his nimble haste
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet
Told of a many thousand warlike French
To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him
HUBERT No had my lord Why did you not provoke me
KING JOHN It is the curse of kings to be attended
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
To break within the bloody house of life
And on the winking of authority
To understand a law to know the meaning
Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns
HUBERT Here is your hand and seal for what I did
Is to be made then shall this hand and seal
Witness against us to damnation
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by
This murder had not come into my mind
Finding thee fit for bloody villainy
And thou to be endeared to a king
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince
KING JOHN Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause
When I spake darkly what I purposed
As bid me tell my tale in express words
Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me
But thou didst understand me by my signs
And didst in signs again parley with sin
Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent
And consequently thy rude hand to act
The deed which both our tongues held vile to name
Out of my sight and never see me more
My nobles leave me and my state is braved
Nay in the body of the fleshly land
This kingdom this confine of blood and breath
Hostility and civil tumult reigns
HUBERT Arm you against your other enemies
Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought
Which howsoever rude exteriorly
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
Than to be butcher of an innocent child
KING JOHN Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers
Throw this report on their incensed rage
And make them tame to their obedience
Forgive the comment that my passion made
Upon thy feature for my rage was blind
And foul imaginary eyes of blood
Presented thee more hideous than thou art
O answer not but to my closet bring
The angry lords with all expedient haste
I conjure thee but slowly run more fast                  Exeunt
SCENE 3
England Before the castle
Enter ARTHUR on the walls
ARTHUR The wall is high and yet will I leap down
Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not
If I get down and do not break my limbs
Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones
Enter PEMBROKE SALISBURY and BIGOT
SALISBURY Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury
It is our safety and we must embrace
This gentle offer of the perilous time
PEMBROKE Who brought that letter from the Cardinal
SALISBURY The Count Melun a noble lord of France
Is much more general than these lines import
Enter the BASTARD
The King by me requests your presence straight
We will not line his thin bestained cloak
With our pure honours nor attend the foot
Return and tell him so We know the worst
SALISBURY Our griefs and not our manners reason now
BASTARD But there is little reason in your grief
PEMBROKE Sir sir impatience hath his privilege
SALISBURY This is the prison What is he lies here
PEMBROKE O death made proud with pure and princely beauty
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed
SALISBURY Murder as hating what himself hath done
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge
SALISBURY Sir Richard what think you Have you beheld
Or have you read or heard or could you think
Or do you almost think although you see
That you do see Could thought without this object
Form such another This is the very top
The height the crest or crest unto the crest
The wildest savagery the vilest stroke
Presented to the tears of soft remorse
And this so sole and so unmatchable
Shall give a holiness a purity
To the yet unbegotten sin of times
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest
Exampled by this heinous spectacle
BASTARD It is a damned and a bloody work
The graceless action of a heavy hand
If that it be the work of any hand
SALISBURY If that it be the work of any hand
We had a kind of light what would ensue
The practice and the purpose of the King
From whose obedience I forbid my soul
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life
And breathing to his breathless excellence
The incense of a vow a holy vow
Never to taste the pleasures of the world
Never to be infected with delight
Nor conversant with ease and idleness
Till I have set a glory to this hand
By giving it the worship of revenge
PEMBROKE and BIGOT Our souls religiously confirm thy words
Enter HUBERT
HUBERT Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you
Arthur doth live the King hath sent for you
SALISBURY O he is bold and blushes not at death
Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone
HUBERT I am no villain
BASTARD Your sword is bright sir put it up again
HUBERT Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say
I would not have you lord forget yourself
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence
Lest I by marking of your rage forget
Your worth your greatness and nobility
HUBERT Not for my life but yet I dare defend
My innocent life against an emperor
SALISBURY Thou art a murderer
HUBERT Do not prove me so
Not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies
PEMBROKE Cut him to pieces
BASTARD Keep the peace I say
SALISBURY Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge
BASTARD Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury
If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame
That you shall think the devil is come from hell
BIGOT What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge
Second a villain and a murderer
HUBERT Lord Bigot I am none
SALISBURY Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes
For villainy is not without such rheum
And he long traded in it makes it seem
Like rivers of remorse and innocency
Away with me all you whose souls abhor
For I am stifled with this smell of sin
BIGOT Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there
PEMBROKE There tell the King he may inquire us out
Exeunt LORDS
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death
HUBERT Do but hear me sir
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child
BASTARD If thou didst but consent
To this most cruel act do but despair
That ever spider twisted from her womb
Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam
To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself
Put but a little water in a spoon
And it shall be as all the ocean
Enough to stifle such a villain up
I do suspect thee very grievously
HUBERT If I in act consent or sin of thought
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay
Let hell want pains enough to torture me
I left him well
BASTARD Go bear him in thine arms
Among the thorns and dangers of this world
How easy dost thou take all England up
From forth this morsel of dead royalty
The life the right and truth of all this realm
Is fled to heaven and England now is left
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace
Now powers from home and discontents at home
Meet in one line and vast confusion waits
The imminent decay of wrested pomp
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
Hold out this tempest Bear away that child
A thousand businesses are brief in hand
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land                Exeunt

ACT V SCENE 1
Enter KING JOHN PANDULPH and attendants
KING JOHN Thus have I yielded up into your hand
The circle of my glory
From this my hand as holding of the Pope
Your sovereign greatness and authority
KING JOHN Now keep your holy word go meet the French
And from his Holiness use all your power
Our discontented counties do revolt
Our people quarrel with obedience
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
To stranger blood to foreign royalty
Rests by you only to be qualified
Or overthrow incurable ensues
PANDULPH It was my breath that blew this tempest up
Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope
But since you are a gentle convertite
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
Upon your oath of service to the Pope
Go I to make the French lay down their arms                 Exit
My crown I should give off Even so I have
I did suppose it should be on constraint
Enter the BASTARD
BASTARD All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out
Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers
Your nobles will not hear you but are gone
To offer service to your enemy
And wild amazement hurries up and down
The little number of your doubtful friends
KING JOHN Would not my lords return to me again
After they heard young Arthur was alive
BASTARD They found him dead and cast into the streets
An empty casket where the jewel of life
KING JOHN That villain Hubert told me he did live
BASTARD So on my soul he did for aught he knew
But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad
Be great in act as you have been in thought
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye
Be stirring as the time be fire with fire
Of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes
That borrow their behaviours from the great
Grow great by your example and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution
Away and glister like the god of war
When he intendeth to become the field
Show boldness and aspiring confidence
What shall they seek the lion in his den
And fright him there and make him tremble there
O let it not be said Forage and run
To meet displeasure farther from the doors
And grapple with him ere he come so nigh
KING JOHN The legate of the Pope hath been with me
And I have made a happy peace with him
Led by the Dauphin
BASTARD O inglorious league
Shall we upon the footing of our land
Insinuation parley and base truce
To arms invasive Shall a beardless boy
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil
Mocking the air with colours idly spread
And find no check Let us my liege to arms
Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace
Or if he do let it at least be said
They saw we had a purpose of defence
KING JOHN Have thou the ordering of this present time
BASTARD Away then with good courage
Yet I know
Our party may well meet a prouder foe                     Exeunt
SCENE 2
Enter in arms LEWIS SALISBURY MELUN PEMBROKE BIGOT and soldiers
LEWIS My Lord Melun let this be copied out
And keep it safe for our remembrance
Return the precedent to these lords again
That having our fair order written down
May know wherefore we took the sacrament
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable
SALISBURY Upon our sides it never shall be broken
And noble Dauphin albeit we swear
To your proceedings yet believe me Prince
I am not glad that such a sore of time
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
By making many O it grieves my soul
That I must draw this metal from my side
Where honourable rescue and defence
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury
But such is the infection of the time
That for the health and physic of our right
We cannot deal but with the very hand
Of stern injustice and confused wrong
That we the sons and children of this isle
Were born to see so sad an hour as this
Upon her gentle bosom and fill up
To grace the gentry of a land remote
And follow unacquainted colours here
What here O nation that thou couldst remove
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore
Where these two Christian armies might combine
The blood of malice in a vein of league
And not to spend it so unneighbourly
LEWIS A noble temper dost thou show in this
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
Doth make an earthquake of nobility
O what a noble combat hast thou fought
Between compulsion and a brave respect
Let me wipe off this honourable dew
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks
Being an ordinary inundation
But this effusion of such manly drops
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury
And with a great heart heave away this storm
Commend these waters to those baby eyes
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts
Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping
Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
Into the purse of rich prosperity
As Lewis himself So nobles shall you all
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine
Enter PANDULPH
And even there methinks an angel spake
Look where the holy legate comes apace
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
And on our actions set the name of right
With holy breath
PANDULPH Hail noble prince of France
Himself to Rome his spirit is come in
That so stood out against the holy Church
The great metropolis and see of Rome
And tame the savage spirit of wild war
That like a lion fostered up at hand
It may lie gently at the foot of peace
And be no further harmful than in show
LEWIS Your Grace shall pardon me I will not back
To be a secondary at control
To any sovereign state throughout the world
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
And brought in matter that should feed this fire
With that same weak wind which enkindled it
You taught me how to know the face of right
Acquainted me with interest to this land
Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart
And come ye now to tell me John hath made
His peace with Rome What is that peace to me
After young Arthur claim this land for mine
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome
What men provided what munition sent
That undergo this charge Who else but I
And such as to my claim are liable
Sweat in this business and maintain this war
Have I not heard these islanders shout out
Have I not here the best cards for the game
No no on my soul it never shall be said
PANDULPH You look but on the outside of this work
LEWIS Outside or inside I will not return
Till my attempt so much be glorified
As to my ample hope was promised
Before I drew this gallant head of war
To outlook conquest and to will renown
Even in the jaws of danger and of death
What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us
Enter the BASTARD attended
BASTARD According to the fair play of the world
Let me have audience I am sent to speak
My holy lord of Milan from the King
I come to learn how you have dealt for him
And as you answer I do know the scope
And warrant limited unto my tongue
And will not temporize with my entreaties
The youth says well Now hear our English King
For thus his royalty doth speak in me
This apish and unmannerly approach
To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms
From out the circle of his territories
That hand which had the strength even at your door
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch
To dive like buckets in concealed wells
To crouch in litter of your stable planks
To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out
In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here
That in your chambers gave you chastisement
No Know the gallant monarch is in arms
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest
And you degenerate you ingrate revolts
You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb
Of your dear mother England blush for shame
Like Amazons come tripping after drums
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change
Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts
To fierce and bloody inclination
LEWIS There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace
We grant thou canst outscold us Fare thee well
We hold our time too precious to be spent
With such a brabbler
PANDULPH Give me leave to speak
BASTARD No I will speak
LEWIS We will attend to neither
Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war
Plead for our interest and our being here
BASTARD Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out
And so shall you being beaten Do but start
And echo with the clamour of thy drum
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine
Sound but another and another shall
Not trusting to this halting legate here
Is warlike John and in his forehead sits
To feast upon whole thousands of the French
LEWIS Strike up our drums to find this danger out
BASTARD And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt
Exeunt
SCENE 3
England The field of battle
Alarums Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT
KING JOHN How goes the day with us O tell me Hubert
HUBERT Badly I fear How fares your Majesty
KING JOHN This fever that hath troubled me so long
Lies heavy on me O my heart is sick
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge
Desires your Majesty to leave the field
And send him word by me which way you go
KING JOHN Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there
MESSENGER Be of good comfort for the great supply
That was expected by the Dauphin here
This news was brought to Richard but even now
The French fight coldly and retire themselves
KING JOHN Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up
And will not let me welcome this good news
Set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight
Weakness possesseth me and I am faint                    Exeunt
SCENE 4
England Another part of the battlefield
Enter SALISBURY PEMBROKE and BIGOT
PEMBROKE Up once again put spirit in the French
If they miscarry we miscarry too
SALISBURY That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge
In spite of spite alone upholds the day
PEMBROKE They say King John sore sick hath left the field
Enter MELUN wounded
MELUN Lead me to the revolts of England here
SALISBURY When we were happy we had other names
PEMBROKE It is the Count Melun
SALISBURY Wounded to death
MELUN Fly noble English you are bought and sold
Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
And welcome home again discarded faith
Seek out King John and fall before his feet
For if the French be lords of this loud day
He means to recompense the pains you take
By cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn
And I with him and many moe with me
Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury
Even on that altar where we swore to you
Dear amity and everlasting love
SALISBURY May this be possible May this be true
MELUN Have I not hideous death within my view
Retaining but a quantity of life
Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
What in the world should make me now deceive
Since I must lose the use of all deceit
Why should I then be false since it is true
That I must die here and live hence by truth
I say again if Lewis do will the day
Behold another day break in the east
But even this night whose black contagious breath
Already smokes about the burning crest
Even this ill night your breathing shall expire
Paying the fine of rated treachery
Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives
If Lewis by your assistance win the day
Commend me to one Hubert with your King
Awakes my conscience to confess all this
In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence
From forth the noise and rumour of the field
Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
In peace and part this body and my soul
With contemplation and devout desires
SALISBURY We do believe thee and beshrew my soul
But I do love the favour and the form
Of this most fair occasion by the which
We will untread the steps of damned flight
And like a bated and retired flood
Leaving our rankness and irregular course
And calmly run on in obedience
Even to our ocean to great King John
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence
For I do see the cruel pangs of death
Right in thine eye Away my friends New flight
And happy newness that intends old right
Exeunt leading off MELUN
SCENE 5
England The French camp
Enter LEWIS and his train
LEWIS The sun of heaven methought was loath to set
When English measure backward their own ground
In faint retire O bravely came we off
When with a volley of our needless shot
After such bloody toil we bid good night
Last in the field and almost lords of it
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER Where is my prince the Dauphin
LEWIS Here what news
MESSENGER The Count Melun is slain the English lords
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands
LEWIS Ah foul shrewd news Beshrew thy very heart
As this hath made me Who was he that said
King John did fly an hour or two before
MESSENGER Whoever spoke it it is true my lord
The day shall not be up so soon as I
SCENE 6
An open place wear Swinstead Abbey
Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT severally
BASTARD A friend What art thou
HUBERT Of the part of England
BASTARD Whither dost thou go
Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine
BASTARD Hubert I think
HUBERT Thou hast a perfect thought
I will upon all hazards well believe
Who art thou
BASTARD Who thou wilt And if thou please
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
I come one way of the Plantagenets
HUBERT Unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night
Have done me shame Brave soldier pardon me
That any accent breaking from thy tongue
Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear
BASTARD Come come sans compliment what news abroad
HUBERT Why here walk I in the black brow of night
To find you out
HUBERT O my sweet sir news fitting to the night
Black fearful comfortless and horrible
BASTARD Show me the very wound of this ill news
I left him almost speechless and broke out
To acquaint you with this evil that you might
The better arm you to the sudden time
Than if you had at leisure known of this
BASTARD How did he take it who did taste to him
HUBERT A monk I tell you a resolved villain
Whose bowels suddenly burst out The King
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover
BASTARD Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty
HUBERT Why know you not The lords are all come back
And brought Prince Henry in their company
And they are all about his Majesty
BASTARD Withhold thine indignation mighty heaven
And tempt us not to bear above our power
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them
Away before conduct me to the King
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come                     Exeunt
SCENE 7
The orchard at Swinstead Abbey
Enter PRINCE HENRY SALISBURY and BIGOT
PRINCE HENRY It is too late the life of all his blood
Doth by the idle comments that it makes
Foretell the ending of mortality
Enter PEMBROKE
PEMBROKE His Highness yet doth speak and holds belief
That being brought into the open air
It would allay the burning quality
Of that fell poison which assaileth him
PRINCE HENRY Let him be brought into the orchard here
Doth he still rage                                    Exit BIGOT
PEMBROKE He is more patient
Than when you left him even now he sung
PRINCE HENRY O vanity of sickness Fierce extremes
In their continuance will not feel themselves
Leaves them invisible and his siege is now
Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds
With many legions of strange fantasies
Which in their throng and press to that last hold
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death
His soul and body to their lasting rest
SALISBURY Be of good comfort Prince for you are born
To set a form upon that indigest
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude
KING JOHN in a chair
It would not out at windows nor at doors
There is so hot a summer in my bosom
That all my bowels crumble up to dust
I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
Upon a parchment and against this fire
Do I shrink up
PRINCE HENRY How fares your Majesty
And none of you will bid the winter come
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much
I beg cold comfort and you are so strait
And so ingrateful you deny me that
PRINCE HENRY O that there were some virtue in my tears
That might relieve you
KING JOHN The salt in them is hot
Within me is a hell and there the poison
On unreprievable condemned blood
Enter the BASTARD
BASTARD O I am scalded with my violent motion
And spleen of speed to see your Majesty
KING JOHN O cousin thou art come to set mine eye
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
Are turned to one thread one little hair
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by
Which holds but till thy news be uttered
And then all this thou seest is but a clod
And module of confounded royalty
BASTARD The Dauphin is preparing hitherward
Where God He knows how we shall answer him
As I upon advantage did remove
Were in the Washes all unwarily
SALISBURY You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear
PRINCE HENRY Even so must I run on and even so stop
What surety of the world what hope what stay
When this was now a king and now is clay
BASTARD Art thou gone so I do but stay behind
To do the office for thee of revenge
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven
As it on earth hath been thy servant still
Now now you stars that move in your right spheres
And instantly return with me again
To push destruction and perpetual shame
Out of the weak door of our fainting land
Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought
The Dauphin rages at our very heels
SALISBURY It seems you know not then so much as we
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin
And brings from him such offers of our peace
As we with honour and respect may take
With purpose presently to leave this war
BASTARD He will the rather do it when he sees
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence
To the disposing of the Cardinal
With whom yourself myself and other lords
If you think meet this afternoon will post
To consummate this business happily
BASTARD Let it be so And you my noble Prince
BASTARD Thither shall it then
And happily may your sweet self put on
The lineal state and glory of the land
To whom with all submission on my knee
I do bequeath my faithful services
And true subjection everlastingly
SALISBURY And the like tender of our love we make
To rest without a spot for evermore
PRINCE HENRY I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
And knows not how to do it but with tears
BASTARD O let us pay the time but needful woe
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs
This England never did nor never shall
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror
But when it first did help to wound itself
Now these her princes are come home again
Come the three corners of the world in arms
And we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue
If England to itself do rest but true                     Exeunt

ACT I SCENE I
Rome A street
Enter Flavius Marullus and certain Commoners
FLAVIUS Hence home you idle creatures get you home
Is this a holiday What know you not
Being mechanical you ought not walk
Upon a laboring day without the sign
Of your profession Speak what trade art thou
FIRST COMMONER Why sir a carpenter
MARULLUS Where is thy leather apron and thy rule
What dost thou with thy best apparel on
You sir what trade are you
SECOND COMMONER Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am
but as you would say a cobbler
MARULLUS But what trade art thou Answer me directly
SECOND COMMONER A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe
conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
MARULLUS What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade
SECOND COMMONER Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet
if you be out sir I can mend you
SECOND COMMONER Why sir cobble you
FLAVIUS Thou art a cobbler art thou
SECOND COMMONER Truly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I
awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in
great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon
FLAVIUS But wherefore art not in thy shop today
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets
SECOND COMMONER Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself
into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar
and to rejoice in his triumph
MARULLUS Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home
What tributaries follow him to Rome
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things
O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome
Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft
To towers and windows yea to chimney tops
Your infants in your arms and there have sat
The livelong day with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome
And when you saw his chariot but appear
Have you not made an universal shout
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores
And do you now put on your best attire
And do you now cull out a holiday
And do you now strew flowers in his way
Be gone
Run to your houses fall upon your knees
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude
FLAVIUS Go go good countrymen and for this fault
Assemble all the poor men of your sort
Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears
Into the channel till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all
Exeunt all Commoners
See whether their basest metal be not moved
Go you down that way towards the Capitol
This way will I Disrobe the images
MARULLUS May we do so
You know it is the feast of Lupercal
FLAVIUS It is no matter let no images
And drive away the vulgar from the streets
So do you too where you perceive them thick
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness              Exeunt
SCENE II
A public place
Flourish Enter Caesar Antony for the course Calpurnia Portia
Decius Cicero Brutus Cassius and Casca a great crowd follows
among them a Soothsayer
CAESAR Calpurnia
CASCA Peace ho Caesar speaks
Music ceases
CAESAR Calpurnia
CALPURNIA Here my lord
When he doth run his course Antonio
ANTONY Caesar my lord
CAESAR Forget not in your speed Antonio
To touch Calpurnia for our elders say
The barren touched in this holy chase
Shake off their sterile curse
ANTONY I shall remember
CAESAR Set on and leave no ceremony out           Flourish
SOOTHSAYER Caesar
CAESAR Ha Who calls
CASCA Bid every noise be still Peace yet again
CAESAR Who is it in the press that calls on me
I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
CAESAR What man is that
BRUTUS A soothsayer you beware the ides of March
CAESAR Set him before me let me see his face
CASSIUS Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar
SOOTHSAYER Beware the ides of March
CAESAR He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass
Sennet Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius
CASSIUS Will you go see the order of the course
BRUTUS Not I
CASSIUS I pray you do
BRUTUS I am not gamesome I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony
Let me not hinder Cassius your desires
CASSIUS Brutus I do observe you now of late
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you
BRUTUS Cassius
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference
Conceptions only proper to myself
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors
Nor construe any further my neglect
Than that poor Brutus with himself at war
Forgets the shows of love to other men
CASSIUS Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
Tell me good Brutus can you see your face
BRUTUS No Cassius for the eye sees not itself
But by reflection by some other things
And it is very much lamented Brutus
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye
That you might see your shadow I have heard
Where many of the best respect in Rome
Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus
BRUTUS Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me
CASSIUS Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection I your glass
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of
And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus
Were I a common laugher or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout then hold me dangerous
Flourish and shout
BRUTUS What means this shouting I do fear the people
Choose Caesar for their king
CASSIUS Ay do you fear it
Then must I think you would not have it so
BRUTUS I would not Cassius yet I love him well
But wherefore do you hold me here so long
What is it that you would impart to me
If it be aught toward the general good
And I will look on both indifferently
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death
CASSIUS I know that virtue to be in you Brutus
As well as I do know your outward favor
Well honor is the subject of my story
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life but for my single self
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself
I was born free as Caesar so were you
We both have fed as well and we can both
For once upon a raw and gusty day
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores
Leap in with me into this angry flood
Accoutred as I was I plunged in
And bade him follow So indeed he did
With lusty sinews throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy
But ere we could arrive the point proposed
I as Aeneas our great ancestor
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar And this man
Is now become a god and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him
He had a fever when he was in Spain
And when the fit was on him I did mark
His coward lips did from their color fly
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his luster I did hear him groan
Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books
As a sick girl Ye gods It doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone Shout                    Flourish
BRUTUS Another general shout
I do believe that these applauses are
CASSIUS Why man he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonorable graves
Men at some time are masters of their fates
The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars
But in ourselves that we are underlings
Why should that name be sounded more than yours
Write them together yours is as fair a name
Sound them it doth become the mouth as well
Now in the names of all the gods at once
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed
That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed
Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods
When went there by an age since the great flood
But it was famed with more than with one man
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough
When there is in it but one only man
O you and I have heard our fathers say
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king
BRUTUS That you do love me I am nothing jealous
What you would work me to I have some aim
How I have thought of this and of these times
I shall recount hereafter for this present
I would not so with love I might entreat you
Be any further moved What you have said
I will consider what you have to say
I will with patience hear and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things
Till then my noble friend chew upon this
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us
CASSIUS I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus
BRUTUS The games are done and Caesar is returning
CASSIUS As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve
And he will after his sour fashion tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note today
BRUTUS I will do so But look you Cassius
And all the rest look like a chidden train
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol
CASSIUS Casca will tell us what the matter is
CAESAR Antonio
ANTONY Caesar
CAESAR Let me have men about me that are fat
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look
He thinks too much such men are dangerous
He is a noble Roman and well given
CAESAR Would he were fatter But I fear him not
Yet if my name were liable to fear
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays
As thou dost Antony he hears no music
Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort
That could be moved to smile at anything
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves
And therefore are they very dangerous
Than what I fear for always I am Caesar
Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf
Sennet Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca
BRUTUS Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today
That Caesar looks so sad
CASCA Why you were with him were you not
BRUTUS I should not then ask Casca what had chanced
CASCA Why there was a crown offered him and being offered him
he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the
people fell ashouting
BRUTUS What was the second noise for
CASCA Why for that too
CASSIUS They shouted thrice What was the last cry for
CASCA Why for that too
BRUTUS Was the crown offered him thrice
CASCA Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler
than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors
shouted
CASSIUS Who offered him the crown
CASCA Why Antony
BRUTUS Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca
mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a
that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered
it to him again then he put it by again But to my thinking he
was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it
the third time he put it the third time by and still as he
refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands
and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of
stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had
almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it And
for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips
and receiving the bad air
CASSIUS But soft I pray you what did Caesars wound
CASCA He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was
speechless
CASSIUS No Caesar hath it not but you and I
And honest Casca we have the falling sickness
CASCA I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell
down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him
according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do
the players in the theatre I am no true man
BRUTUS What said he when he came unto himself
CASCA Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common
herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet
and offered them his throat to cut An had been a man of any
occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I
might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came
to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss
he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or
them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done
no less
BRUTUS And after that he came thus sad away
CASCA Ay
CASSIUS Did Cicero say anything
CASCA Ay he spoke Greek
CASSIUS To what effect
again but those that understood him smiled at one another and
shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I
could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling
There was more foolery yet if could remember it
CASSIUS Will you sup with me tonight Casca
CASCA No I am promised forth
CASSIUS Will you dine with me tomorrow
CASCA Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth
the eating
CASSIUS Good I will expect you
CASCA Do so farewell both                            Exit
BRUTUS What a blunt fellow is this grown to be
He was quick mettle when he went to school
CASSIUS So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise
However he puts on this tardy form
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite
BRUTUS And so it is For this time I will leave you
Tomorrow if you please to speak with me
I will come home to you or if you will
Come home to me and I will wait for you
CASSIUS I will do so Till then think of the world
Exit Brutus
Well Brutus thou art noble yet I see
Thy honorable mettle may be wrought
From that it is disposed therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes
For who so firm that cannot be seduced
Caesar doth bear me hard but he loves Brutus
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius
He should not humor me I will this night
In several hands in at his windows throw
As if they came from several citizens
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name wherein obscurely
And after this let Caesar seat him sure
For we will shake him or worse days endure           Exit
SCENE III
A street Thunder and lightning
Enter from opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and Cicero
CICERO Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home
Why are you breathless and why stare you so
CASCA Are not you moved when all the sway of earth
Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero
I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam
To be exalted with the threatening clouds
But never till tonight never till now
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire
Either there is a civil strife in heaven
Or else the world too saucy with the gods
Incenses them to send destruction
CICERO Why saw you anything more wonderful
Held up his left hand which did flame and burn
Against the Capitol I met a lion
Without annoying me And there were drawn
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women
Transformed with their fear who swore they saw
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets
And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noonday upon the marketplace
Howling and shrieking When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet let not men say
For I believe they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon
But men may construe things after their fashion
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves
Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow
CASCA He doth for he did bid Antonio
Send word to you he would be there tomorrow
CICERO Good then Casca This disturbed sky
Is not to walk in
CASCA Farewell Cicero                          Exit Cicero
Enter Cassius
CASCA A Roman
CASSIUS Casca by your voice
CASCA Your ear is good Cassius what night is this
CASSIUS A very pleasing night to honest men
CASCA Who ever knew the heavens menace so
CASSIUS Those that have known the earth so full of faults
Submitting me unto the perilous night
And thus unbraced Casca as you see
Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone
The breast of heaven I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it
CASCA But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
It is the part of men to fear and tremble
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us
CASSIUS You are dull Casca and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want
Or else you use not You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder
To see the strange impatience of the heavens
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind
Why old men fools and children calculate
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality why you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state
Now could I Casca name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night
That thunders lightens opens graves and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action yet prodigious grown
And fearful as these strange eruptions are
CASSIUS Let it be who it is for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
CASCA Indeed they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land
In every place save here in Italy
CASSIUS I know where I will wear this dagger then
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius
Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong
Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass
Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit
But life being weary of these worldly bars
Never lacks power to dismiss itself
If I know this know all the world besides
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure                  Thunder still
CASCA So can I
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity
CASSIUS And why should Caesar be a tyrant then
Poor man I know he would not be a wolf
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep
He were no lion were not Romans hinds
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome
What rubbish and what offal when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief
Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman then I know
And dangers are to me indifferent
CASCA You speak to Casca and to such a man
Be factious for redress of all these griefs
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest
Now know you Casca I have moved already
To undergo with me an enterprise
And I do know by this they stay for me
There is no stir or walking in the streets
And the complexion of the element
Most bloody fiery and most terrible
Enter Cinna
CASCA Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
He is a friend Cinna where haste you so
CASSIUS No it is Casca one incorporate
CINNA Yes you are
O Cassius if you could
CASSIUS Be you content Good Cinna take this paper
Where Brutus may but find it and throw this
In at his window set this up with wax
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there
To seek you at your house Well I will hie
And so bestow these papers as you bade me
Exit Cinna
Come Casca you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house Three parts of him
Is ours already and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours
And that which would appear offense in us
His countenance like richest alchemy
Will change to virtue and to worthiness
CASSIUS Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited Let us go
For it is after midnight and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him                Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
Enter Brutus in his orchard
BRUTUS What Lucius ho
I cannot by the progress of the stars
Give guess how near to day Lucius I say
I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius
Enter Lucius
BRUTUS Get me a taper in my study Lucius
When it is lighted come and call me here
LUCIUS I will my lord                                 Exit
BRUTUS It must be by his death and for my part
I know no personal cause to spurn at him
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
And that craves wary walking Crown him that
And then I grant we put a sting in him
That at his will he may do danger with
The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar
But when he once attains the upmost round
He then unto the ladder turns his back
Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend So Caesar may
Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is
Fashion it thus that what he is augmented
Would run to these and these extremities
And kill him in the shell
LUCIUS The taper burneth in your closet sir
Searching the window for a flint I found
It did not lie there when I went to bed
Gives him the letter
BRUTUS Get you to bed again it is not day
Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March
LUCIUS I know not sir
BRUTUS Look in the calendar and bring me word
LUCIUS I will sir                                     Exit
BRUTUS The exhalations whizzing in the air
Give so much light that I may read by them
Opens the letter and reads
Where I have took them up
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
To speak and strike O Rome I make thee promise
If the redress will follow thou receivest
Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus
LUCIUS Sir March is wasted fifteen days
Knocking within
Exit Lucius
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept
Between the acting of a dreadful thing
And the first motion all the interim is
Like a phantasma or a hideous dream
The genius and the mortal instruments
Are then in council and the state of man
Like to a little kingdom suffers then
The nature of an insurrection
Who doth desire to see you
BRUTUS Is he alone
LUCIUS No sir there are more with him
BRUTUS Do you know them
And half their faces buried in their cloaks
That by no means I may discover them
By any mark of favor
They are the faction O Conspiracy
Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night
When evils are most free O then by day
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none Conspiracy
Hide it in smiles and affability
For if thou path thy native semblance on
Not Erebus itself were dim enough
To hide thee from prevention
Enter the conspirators Cassius Casca Decius Cinna
Metellus Cimber and Trebonius
CASSIUS I think we are too bold upon your rest
Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you
BRUTUS I have been up this hour awake all night
Know I these men that come along with you
CASSIUS Yes every man of them and no man here
But honors you and every one doth wish
You had but that opinion of yourself
Which every noble Roman bears of you
This is Trebonius
BRUTUS He is welcome hither
CASSIUS This Decius Brutus
BRUTUS He is welcome too
CASSIUS This Casca this Cinna and this Metellus Cimber
BRUTUS They are all welcome
What watchful cares do interpose themselves
Betwixt your eyes and night
CASSIUS Shall I entreat a word                 They whisper
DECIUS Here lies the east Doth not the day break here
CASCA No
CINNA O pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines
That fret the clouds are messengers of day
CASCA You shall confess that you are both deceived
Here as I point my sword the sun arises
Which is a great way growing on the south
Weighing the youthful season of the year
Some two months hence up higher toward the north
He first presents his fire and the high east
Stands as the Capitol directly here
BRUTUS Give me your hands all over one by one
CASSIUS And let us swear our resolution
BRUTUS No not an oath If not the face of men
If these be motives weak break off betimes
And every man hence to his idle bed
Till each man drop by lottery But if these
As I am sure they do bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valor
The melting spirits of women then countrymen
What need we any spur but our own cause
To prick us to redress What other bond
Than secret Romans that have spoke the word
And will not palter And what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged
That this shall be or we will fall for it
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears and nobly bears
Is guilty of a several bastardy
If he do break the smallest particle
CASSIUS But what of Cicero Shall we sound him
I think he will stand very strong with us
CASCA Let us not leave him out
CINNA No by no means
METELLUS O let us have him for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear
But all be buried in his gravity
BRUTUS O name him not let us not break with him
For he will never follow anything
That other men begin
CASSIUS Then leave him out
CASCA Indeed he is not fit
CASSIUS Decius well urged I think it is not meet
Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar
Should outlive Caesar We shall find of him
A shrewd contriver and you know his means
If he improve them may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all which to prevent
Let Antony and Caesar fall together
BRUTUS Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar
Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar
And in the spirit of men there is no blood
And not dismember Caesar But alas
Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds
And let our hearts as subtle masters do
Stir up their servants to an act of rage
Our purpose necessary and not envious
Which so appearing to the common eyes
And for Mark Antony think not of him
CASSIUS Yet I fear him
BRUTUS Alas good Cassius do not think of him
If he love Caesar all that he can do
Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar
And that were much he should for he is given
To sports to wildness and much company
For he will live and laugh at this hereafter
Clock strikes
BRUTUS Peace count the clock
CASSIUS The clock hath stricken three
CASSIUS But it is doubtful yet
Whether Caesar will come forth today or no
For he is superstitious grown of late
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
It may be these apparent prodigies
And the persuasion of his augurers
May hold him from the Capitol today
DECIUS Never fear that If he be so resolved
And bears with glasses elephants with holes
Lions with toils and men with flatterers
But when I tell him he hates flatterers
He says he does being then most flattered
Let me work
For I can give his humor the true bent
And I will bring him to the Capitol
CASSIUS Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
BRUTUS By the eighth hour Is that the utter most
CINNA Be that the uttermost and fail not then
METELLUS Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey
I wonder none of you have thought of him
BRUTUS Now good Metellus go along by him
He loves me well and I have given him reasons
And friends disperse yourselves but all remember
What you have said and show yourselves true Romans
BRUTUS Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily
Let not our looks put on our purposes
But bear it as our Roman actors do
With untired spirits and formal constancy
And so good morrow to you every one
Exeunt all but Brutus
Boy Lucius Fast asleep It is no matter
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies
Which busy care draws in the brains of men
Enter Portia
PORTIA Brutus my lord
BRUTUS Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now
It is not for your health thus to commit
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning
PORTIA Nor for yours neither have ungently Brutus
Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper
Musing and sighing with your arms across
You stared upon me with ungentle looks
But with an angry waiter of your hand
Gave sign for me to leave you So I did
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Hoping it was but an effect of humor
Which sometime hath his hour with every man
It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep
And could it work so much upon your shape
I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief
BRUTUS I am not well in health and that is all
PORTIA Brutus is wise and were he not in health
He would embrace the means to come by it
BRUTUS Why so I do Good Portia go to bed
PORTIA Is Brutus sick and is it physical
To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
To dare the vile contagion of the night
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
To add unto his sickness No my Brutus
You have some sick offense within your mind
Which by the right and virtue of my place
I ought to know of and upon my knees
I charm you by my once commended beauty
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one
That you unfold to me yourself your half
Why you are heavy and what men tonight
Have had resort to you for here have been
Some six or seven who did hide their faces
Even from darkness
BRUTUS Kneel not gentle Portia
PORTIA I should not need if you were gentle Brutus
Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you Am I yourself
But as it were in sort or limitation
To keep with you at meals comfort your bed
And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure If it be no more
BRUTUS You are my true and honorable wife
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart
PORTIA If this were true then should I know this secret
I grant I am a woman but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife
I grant I am a woman but withal
Think you I am no stronger than my sex
I have made strong proof of my constancy
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience
BRUTUS O ye gods
Render me worthy of this noble wife Knocking within
Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile
And by and by thy bosom shall partake
The secrets of my heart
All my engagements I will construe to thee
All the charactery of my sad brows
LUCIUS Here is a sick man that would speak with you
BRUTUS Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of
Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how
LIGARIUS Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
BRUTUS O what a time have you chose out brave Caius
To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick
LIGARIUS I am not sick if Brutus have in hand
Any exploit worthy the name of honor
BRUTUS Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it
LIGARIUS By all the gods that Romans bow before
I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome
Brave son derived from honorable loins
Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up
My mortified spirit Now bid me run
And I will strive with things impossible
BRUTUS A piece of work that will make sick men whole
LIGARIUS But are not some whole that we must make sick
BRUTUS That must we also What it is my Caius
I shall unfold to thee as we are going
To whom it must be done
LIGARIUS Set on your foot
To do I know not what but it sufficeth
That Brutus leads me on
BRUTUS Follow me then                                Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter Caesar in his nightgown
CAESAR Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out
Enter a Servant
SERVANT My lord
CAESAR Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
And bring me their opinions of success
SERVANT I will my lord                                Exit
Enter Calpurnia
CALPURNIA What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth
You shall not stir out of your house today
The face of Caesar they are vanished
CALPURNIA Caesar I I stood on ceremonies
Yet now they fright me There is one within
Besides the things that we have heard and seen
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
A lioness hath whelped in the streets
Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol
The noise of battle hurtled in the air
Horses did neigh and dying men did groan
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
O Caesar These things are beyond all use
And I do fear them
CAESAR What can be avoided
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions
Are to the world in general as to Caesar
CALPURNIA When beggars die there are no comets seen
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
CAESAR Cowards die many times before their deaths
The valiant never taste of death but once
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard
It seems to me most strange that men should fear
Seeing that death a necessary end
Will come when it will come
What say the augurers
SERVANT They would not have you to stir forth today
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth
They could not find a heart within the beast
CAESAR The gods do this in shame of cowardice
Caesar should be a beast without a heart
If he should stay at home today for fear
No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he
And I the elder and more terrible
And Caesar shall go forth
CALPURNIA Alas my lord
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence
Do not go forth today Call it my fear
That keeps you in the house and not your own
And he shall say you are not well today
Let me upon my knee prevail in this
CAESAR Mark Antony shall say I am not well
And for thy humor I will stay at home
Enter Decius
DECIUS Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar
I come to fetch you to the Senate House
CAESAR And you are come in very happy time
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come today
Cannot is false and that I dare not falser
I will not come today Tell them so Decius
CALPURNIA Say he is sick
CAESAR Shall Caesar send a lie
To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
Decius go tell them Caesar will not come
DECIUS Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause
CAESAR The cause is in my will I will not come
That is enough to satisfy the Senate
But for your private satisfaction
Because I love you I will let you know
Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home
She dreamt tonight she saw my statue
Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts
Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans
Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
And these does she apply for warnings and portents
And evils imminent and on her knee
DECIUS This dream is all amiss interpreted
It was a vision fair and fortunate
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes
In which so many smiling Romans bathed
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood and that great men shall press
For tinctures stains relics and cognizance
CAESAR And this way have you well expounded it
DECIUS I have when you have heard what I can say
And know it now the Senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar
If you shall send them word you will not come
Their minds may change Besides it were a mock
If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper
Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love
To your proceeding bids me tell you this
And reason to my love is liable
CAESAR How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia
I am ashamed I did yield to them
Give me my robe for I will go
Enter Publius Brutus Ligarius Metellus Casca
Trebonius and Cinna
And look where Publius is come to fetch me
PUBLIUS Good morrowCaesar
CAESAR Welcome Publius
Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius
As that same ague which hath made you lean
CAESAR I thank you for your pains and courtesy
Enter Antony
Is notwithstanding up Good morrow Antony
ANTONY So to most noble Caesar
CAESAR Bid them prepare within
I am to blame to be thus waited for
Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius
Remember that you call on me today
Be near me that I may remember you
That your best friends shall wish I had been further
CAESAR Good friends go in and taste some wine with me
And we like friends will straightway go together
The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon            Exeunt
SCENE III
A street near the Capitol
Enter Artemidorus reading paper
not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark
well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast
wronged Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men
and it is bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal look
about you Security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods
defend thee
Here will I stand till Caesar pass along
And as a suitor will I give him this
My heart laments that virtue cannot live
Out of the teeth of emulation
If thou read this O Caesar thou mayest live
If not the Fates with traitors do contrive           Exit
SCENE IV
Another part of the same street before the house of Brutus
Enter Portia and Lucius
PORTIA I prithee boy run to the Senate House
Stay not to answer me but get thee gone
Why dost thou stay
LUCIUS To know my errand madam
PORTIA I would have had thee there and here again
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there
O constancy be strong upon my side
How hard it is for women to keep counsel
Art thou here yet
LUCIUS Madam what should I do
Run to the Capitol and nothing else
And so return to you and nothing else
PORTIA Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well
For he went sickly forth and take good note
What Caesar doth what suitors press to him
Hark boy what noise is that
LUCIUS I hear none madam
PORTIA Prithee listen well
I heard a bustling rumor like a fray
And the wind brings it from the Capitol
LUCIUS Sooth madam I hear nothing
Enter the Soothsayer
PORTIA Come hither fellow
Which way hast thou been
SOOTHSAYER At mine own house good lady
SOOTHSAYER About the ninth hour lady
PORTIA Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol
SOOTHSAYER Madam not yet I go to take my stand
To see him pass on to the Capitol
PORTIA Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not
SOOTHSAYER That I have lady If it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me
I shall beseech him to befriend himself
SOOTHSAYER None that I know will be much that I fear may chance
Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels
Of senators of praetors common suitors
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along               Exit
PORTIA I must go in Ay me how weak a thing
The heart of woman is O Brutus
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise
Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint
Run Lucius and commend me to my lord
Say I am merry Come to me again
And bring me word what he doth say to thee
Exeunt severally

ACT III SCENE I
Rome Before the Capitol the Senate sitting above
A crowd of people among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer
Flourish Enter Caesar Brutus Cassius Casca Decius Metellus
Trebonius Cinna Antony Lepidus Popilius Publius and others
CAESAR The ides of March are come
SOOTHSAYER Ay Caesar but not gone
A Hail Caesar Read this schedule
At your best leisure this his humble suit
That touches Caesar nearer Read it great Caesar
CAESAR What touches us ourself shall be last served
ARTEMIDORUS Delay not Caesar read it instantly
CAESAR What is the fellow mad
PUBLIUS Sirrah give place
CASSIUS What urge you your petitions in the street
Come to the Capitol
Caesar goes up to the Senate House the rest follow
POPILIUS I wish your enterprise today may thrive
CASSIUS What enterprise Popilius
POPILIUS Fare you well
Advances to Caesar
BRUTUS What said Popilius Lena
I fear our purpose is discovered
BRUTUS Look how he makes to Caesar Mark him
CASSIUS Casca
Be sudden for we fear prevention
Brutus what shall be done If this be known
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back
For I will slay myself
BRUTUS Cassius be constant
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes
For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change
CASSIUS Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus
He draws Mark Antony out of the way
Exeunt Antony and Trebonius
DECIUS Where is Metellus Cimber Let him
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar
CINNA Casca you are the first that rears your hand
CAESAR Are we all ready What is now amiss
That Caesar and his Senate must redress
METELLUS Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
An humble heart                                     Kneels
CAESAR I must prevent thee Cimber
These couchings and these lowly courtesies
Might fire the blood of ordinary men
And turn preordinance and first decree
Into the law of children Be not fond
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
Thy brother by decree is banished
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way
Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause
Will he be satisfied
METELLUS Is there no voice more worthy than my own
BRUTUS I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
Have an immediate freedom of repeal
CAESAR What Brutus
CASSIUS Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber
CAESAR I could be well moved if I were as you
If I could pray to move prayers would move me
But I am constant as the northern star
There is no fellow in the firmament
They are all fire and every one doth shine
And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive
Yet in the number I do know but one
That unassailable holds on his rank
Unshaked of motion and that I am he
Let me a little show it even in this
And constant do remain to keep him so
CAESAR Hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus
CAESAR Doth not Brutus bootless kneel
CASCA Speak hands for me
Casca first then the other Conspirators
and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar
CINNA Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead
Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
CASSIUS Some to the common pulpits and cry out
BRUTUS People and senators be not affrighted
CASCA Go to the pulpit Brutus
DECIUS And Cassius too
CINNA Here quite confounded with this mutiny
BRUTUS Talk not of standing Publius good cheer
There is no harm intended to your person
Nor to no Roman else So tell them Publius
CASSIUS And leave us Publius lest that the people
Rushing on us should do your age some mischief
BRUTUS Do so and let no man abide this deed
But we the doers
CASSIUS Where is Antony
TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed
Men wives and children stare cry out and run
As it were doomsday
BRUTUS Fates we will know your pleasures
And drawing days out that men stand upon
CASSIUS Why he that cuts off twenty years of life
Cuts off so many years of fearing death
BRUTUS Grant that and then is death a benefit
His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop
Up to the elbows and besmear our swords
Then walk we forth even to the marketplace
CASSIUS Stoop then and wash How many ages hence
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
In states unborn and accents yet unknown
BRUTUS How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport
No worthier than the dust
CASSIUS So oft as that shall be
The men that gave their country liberty
DECIUS What shall we forth
CASSIUS Ay every man away
Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome
Enter a Servant
SERVANT Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down
And being prostrate thus he bade me say
Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest
Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
Say I love Brutus and I honor him
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
May safely come to him and be resolved
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
So well as Brutus living but will follow
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
With all true faith So says my master Antony
BRUTUS Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman
I never thought him worse
Tell him so please him come unto this place
He shall be satisfied and by my honor
BRUTUS I know that we shall have him well to friend
CASSIUS I wish we may but yet have I a mind
That fears him much and my misgiving still
Falls shrewdly to the purpose
BRUTUS But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony
ANTONY O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low
Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils
Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well
I know not gentlemen what you intend
Who else must be let blood who else is rank
If I myself there is no hour so fit
Of half that worth as those your swords made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world
I do beseech ye if you bear me hard
Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke
Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years
I shall not find myself so apt to die
No place will please me so no means of death
As here by Caesar and by you cut off
The choice and master spirits of this age
BRUTUS O Antony beg not your death of us
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel
As by our hands and this our present act
You see we do yet see you but our hands
And this the bleeding business they have done
Our hearts you see not they are pitiful
Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part
To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony
Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts
With all kind love good thoughts and reverence
In the disposing of new dignities
BRUTUS Only be patient till we have appeased
The multitude beside themselves with fear
And then we will deliver you the cause
Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him
Have thus proceeded
ANTONY I doubt not of your wisdom
Let each man render me his bloody hand
First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you
Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand
Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus
Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours
Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius
My credit now stands on such slippery ground
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me
Either a coward or a flatterer
If then thy spirit look upon us now
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death
To see thy Antony making his peace
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes
Most noble In the presence of thy corse
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood
It would become me better than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies
Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand
O world thou wast the forest to this hart
And this indeed O world the heart of thee
How like a deer strucken by many princes
Dost thou here lie
ANTONY Pardon me Caius Cassius
The enemies of Caesar shall say this
Then in a friend it is cold modesty
CASSIUS I blame you not for praising Caesar so
But what compact mean you to have with us
Or shall we on and not depend on you
ANTONY Therefore I took your hands but was indeed
Friends am I with you all and love you all
Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous
BRUTUS Or else were this a savage spectacle
Our reasons are so full of good regard
That were you Antony the son of Caesar
You should be satisfied
And am moreover suitor that I may
Produce his body to the marketplace
And in the pulpit as becomes a friend
Speak in the order of his funeral
BRUTUS You shall Mark Antony
CASSIUS Brutus a word with you
That Antony speak in his funeral
Know you how much the people may be moved
By that which he will utter
BRUTUS By your pardon
I will myself into the pulpit first
What Antony shall speak I will protest
He speaks by leave and by permission
And that we are contented Caesar shall
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
It shall advantage more than do us wrong
CASSIUS I know not what may fall I like it not
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar
Else shall you not have any hand at all
About his funeral And you shall speak
In the same pulpit whereto I am going
After my speech is ended
ANTONY Be it so
I do desire no more
BRUTUS Prepare the body then and follow us
Exeunt all but Antony
ANTONY O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
That mothers shall but smile when they behold
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds
With Ate by his side come hot from hell
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men groaning for burial
Enter a Servant
You serve Octavius Caesar do you not
SERVANT I do Mark Antony
ANTONY Caesar did write for him to come to Rome
SERVANT He did receive his letters and is coming
O Caesar                                     Sees the body
ANTONY Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
Passion I see is catching for mine eyes
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine
Began to water Is thy master coming
SERVANT He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome
ANTONY Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet
Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
Into the marketplace There shall I try
In my oration how the people take
The cruel issue of these bloody men
According to the which thou shalt discourse
To young Octavius of the state of things
SCENE II
The Forum
Enter Brutus and Cassius and a throng of Citizens
CITIZENS We will be satisfied Let us be satisfied
BRUTUS Then follow me and give me audience friends
Cassius go you into the other street
And part the numbers
Those that will follow Cassius go with him
And public reasons shall be rendered
FIRST CITIZEN I will hear Brutus speak
SECOND CITIZEN I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons
When severally we hear them rendered
Exit Cassius with some Citizens
Brutus goes into the pulpit
THIRD CITIZEN The noble Brutus is ascended Silence
BRUTUS Be patient till the last
Romans countrymen and lovers Hear me for my cause and be
silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honor and have
respect to mine honor that you may believe Censure me in your
wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If
then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is
my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome
more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than
that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved me I
weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was
valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him There
is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor
and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a
bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so
rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I
offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If
any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply
ALL None Brutus none
BRUTUS Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar
than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is
enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was
worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death
Here comes his body mourned by Mark Antony who though he had
no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a
place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not With this I
have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country
to need my death
ALL Live Brutus live live
FIRST CITIZEN Bring him with triumph home unto his house
SECOND CITIZEN Give him a statue with his ancestors
THIRD CITIZEN Let him be Caesar
clamors
SECOND CITIZEN Peace Silence Brutus speaks
FIRST CITIZEN Peace ho
BRUTUS Good countrymen let me depart alone
And for my sake stay here with Antony
I do entreat you not a man depart
Save I alone till Antony have spoke                  Exit
FIRST CITIZEN Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony
THIRD CITIZEN Let him go up into the public chair
Goes into the pulpit
FOURTH CITIZEN What does he say of Brutus
He finds himself beholding to us all
FIRST CITIZEN This Caesar was a tyrant
We are blest that Rome is rid of him
SECOND CITIZEN Peace Let us hear what Antony can say
ALL Peace ho Let us hear him
ANTONY Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears
I come to bury Caesar not to praise him
The evil that men do lives after them
The good is oft interred with their bones
So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious
If it were so it was a grievous fault
For Brutus is an honorable man
He was my friend faithful and just to me
But Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honorable man
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious
When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And Brutus is an honorable man
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown
Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious
And sure he is an honorable man
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
But here I am to speak what I do know
You all did love him once not without cause
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him
O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts
And men have lost their reason Bear with me
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar
And I must pause till it come back to me
FIRST CITIZEN Methinks there is much reason in his sayings
SECOND CITIZEN If thou consider rightly of the matter
Caesar has had great wrong
THIRD CITIZEN Has he masters
I fear there will a worse come in his place
FIRST CITIZEN If it be found so some will dear abide it
SECOND CITIZEN Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
FOURTH CITIZEN Now mark him he begins again to speak
ANTONY But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world Now lies he there
And none so poor to do him reverence
O masters If I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong
Who you all know are honorable men
I will not do them wrong I rather choose
To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you
Than I will wrong such honorable men
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
Yea beg a hair of him for memory
And dying mention it within their wills
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue
ANTONY Have patience gentle friends I must not read it
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you
You are not wood you are not stones but men
And being men hearing the will of Caesar
It will inflame you it will make you mad
For if you should O what would come of it
ANTONY Will you be patient Will you stay awhile
I fear I wrong the honorable men
FOURTH CITIZEN They were traitors Honorable men
ALL The will The testament
SECOND CITIZEN They were villains murtherers The will
Read the will
ANTONY You will compel me then to read the will
Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar
And let me show you him that made the will
Shall I descend And will you give me leave
ALL Come down
SECOND CITIZEN Descend
He comes down from the pulpit
THIRD CITIZEN You shall have leave
FOURTH CITIZEN A ring stand round
FIRST CITIZEN Stand from the hearse stand from the body
SECOND CITIZEN Room for Antony most noble Antony
ANTONY Nay press not so upon me stand far off
ALL Stand back room bear back
ANTONY If you have tears prepare to shed them now
You all do know this mantle I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on
That day he overcame the Nervii
See what a rent the envious Casca made
As rushing out of doors to be resolved
Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him
This was the most unkindest cut of all
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab
And in his mantle muffling up his face
Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell
O what a fall was there my countrymen
Then I and you and all of us fell down
O now you weep and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity These are gracious drops
Kind souls what weep you when you but behold
FIRST CITIZEN O piteous spectacle
SECOND CITIZEN O noble Caesar
THIRD CITIZEN O woeful day
FOURTH CITIZEN O traitors villains
FIRST CITIZEN O most bloody sight
SECOND CITIZEN We will be revenged
ALL Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill
Slay Let not a traitor live
ANTONY Stay countrymen
FIRST CITIZEN Peace there Hear the noble Antony
him
ANTONY Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny
They that have done this deed are honorable
What private griefs they have alas I know not
That made them do it They are wise and honorable
And will no doubt with reasons answer you
I come not friends to steal away your hearts
I am no orator as Brutus is
But as you know me all a plain blunt man
That love my friend and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him
For I have neither wit nor words nor worth
Action nor utterance nor the power of speech
I tell you that which you yourselves do know
And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus
And Brutus Antony there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny
THIRD CITIZEN Away then Come seek the conspirators
ANTONY Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak
ALL Peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony
ANTONY Why friends you go to do you know not what
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves
Alas you know not I must tell you then
You have forgot the will I told you of
To every Roman citizen he gives
THIRD CITIZEN O royal Caesar
ANTONY Hear me with patience
ALL Peace ho
ANTONY Moreover he hath left you all his walks
On this side Tiber he hath left them you
To walk abroad and recreate yourselves
Here was a Caesar When comes such another
FIRST CITIZEN Never never Come away away
Take up the body
SECOND CITIZEN Go fetch fire
THIRD CITIZEN Pluck down benches
FOURTH CITIZEN Pluck down forms windows anything
Exeunt Citizens with the body
ANTONY Now let it work Mischief thou art afoot
Take thou what course thou wilt
Enter a Servant
How now fellow
SERVANT Sir Octavius is already come to Rome
ANTONY Where is he
ANTONY And thither will I straight to visit him
He comes upon a wish Fortune is merry
And in this mood will give us anything
SERVANT I heard him say Brutus and Cassius
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome
ANTONY Be like they had some notice of the people
How I had moved them Bring me to Octavius          Exeunt
SCENE III
A street

CINNA I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar

ACT IV SCENE I
A house in Rome Antony Octavius and Lepidus seated at a table
OCTAVIUS Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus
OCTAVIUS Prick him down Antony
LEPIDUS Upon condition Publius shall not live
ANTONY He shall not live look with a spot I damn him
Fetch the will hither and we shall determine
How to cut off some charge in legacies
LEPIDUS What shall I find you here
OCTAVIUS Or here or at the Capitol            Exit Lepidus
ANTONY This is a slight unmeritable man
Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit
One of the three to share it
OCTAVIUS So you thought him
In our black sentence and proscription
ANTONY Octavius I have seen more days than you
And though we lay these honors on this man
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold
To groan and sweat under the business
Either led or driven as we point the way
And having brought our treasure where we will
Then take we down his load and turn him off
Like to the empty ass to shake his ears
And graze in commons
OCTAVIUS You may do your will
ANTONY So is my horse Octavius and for that
I do appoint him store of provender
It is a creature that I teach to fight
To wind to stop to run directly on
And in some taste is Lepidus but so
On objects arts and imitations
Which out of use and staled by other men
Begin his fashion Do not talk of him
But as a property And now Octavius
Listen great things Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers we must straight make head
Therefore let our alliance be combined
And let us presently go sit in council
How covert matters may be best disclosed
And open perils surest answered
OCTAVIUS Let us do so for we are at the stake
And some that smile have in their hearts I fear
Millions of mischiefs                               Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter Brutus Lucilius Lucius and Soldiers Titinius and Pindarus meet them
BRUTUS Stand ho
LUCILIUS Give the word ho and stand
BRUTUS What now Lucilius is Cassius near
LUCILIUS He is at hand and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master
BRUTUS He greets me well Your master Pindarus
In his own change or by ill officers
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone but if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied
PINDARUS I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is full of regard and honor
BRUTUS He is not doubted A word Lucilius
How he received you Let me be resolved
LUCILIUS With courtesy and with respect enough
But not with such familiar instances
Nor with such free and friendly conference
As he hath used of old
BRUTUS Thou hast described
A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith
But hollow men like horses hot at hand
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle
But when they should endure the bloody spur
They fall their crests and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial Comes his army on
The greater part the horse in general
Are come with Cassius                     Low march within
BRUTUS Hark he is arrived
March gently on to meet him
Enter Cassius and his Powers
CASSIUS Stand ho
BRUTUS Stand ho Speak the word along
FIRST SOLDIER Stand
SECOND SOLDIER Stand
THIRD SOLDIER Stand
CASSIUS Most noble brother you have done me wrong
BRUTUS Judge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies
And if not so how should I wrong a brother
CASSIUS Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs
BRUTUS Cassius be content
Speak your griefs softly I do know you well
Before the eyes of both our armies here
Which should perceive nothing but love from us
Let us not wrangle Bid them move away
Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs
And I will give you audience
CASSIUS Pindarus
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground
BRUTUS Lucilius do you the like and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door             Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter Brutus and Cassius
For taking bribes here of the Sardians
Wherein my letters praying on his side
Because I knew the man were slighted off
CASSIUS In such a time as this it is not meet
That every nice offense should bear his comment
BRUTUS Let me tell you Cassius you yourself
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers
CASSIUS I an itching palm
You know that you are Brutus that speaks this
Or by the gods this speech were else your last
BRUTUS The name of Cassius honors this corruption
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head
CASSIUS Chastisement
BRUTUS Remember March the ides of March remember
And not for justice What shall one of us
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus
I had rather be a dog and bay the moon
Than such a Roman
CASSIUS Brutus bait not me
To hedge me in I am a soldier I
Older in practice abler than yourself
To make conditions
BRUTUS Go to you are not Cassius
CASSIUS I am
BRUTUS I say you are not
CASSIUS Urge me no more I shall forget myself
Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
BRUTUS Away slight man
BRUTUS Hear me for I will speak
Must I give way and room to your rash choler
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares
CASSIUS O gods ye gods Must I endure all this
BRUTUS All this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break
Go show your slaves how choleric you are
And make your bondmen tremble Must I bouge
Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor By the gods
You shall digest the venom of your spleen
Though it do split you for from this day forth
When you are waspish
CASSIUS Is it come to this
BRUTUS You say you are a better soldier
Let it appear so make your vaunting true
And it shall please me well For mine own part
I shall be glad to learn of noble men
CASSIUS You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus
I said an elder soldier not a better
BRUTUS If you did I care not
CASSIUS When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
BRUTUS Peace peace You durst not so have tempted him
CASSIUS I durst not
BRUTUS No
CASSIUS What durst not tempt him
BRUTUS For your life you durst not
CASSIUS Do not presume too much upon my love
I may do that I shall be sorry for
BRUTUS You have done that you should be sorry for
There is no terror Cassius in your threats
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not I did send to you
For certain sums of gold which you denied me
For I can raise no money by vile means
By heaven I had rather coin my heart
And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection I did send
To you for gold to pay my legions
Which you denied me Was that done like Cassius
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends
Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts
Dash him to pieces
CASSIUS I denied you not
BRUTUS You did
CASSIUS I did not He was but a fool
That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are
BRUTUS I do not till you practise them on me
CASSIUS You love me not
BRUTUS I do not like your faults
CASSIUS A friendly eye could never see such faults
As huge as high Olympus
CASSIUS Come Antony and young Octavius come
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius
For Cassius is aweary of the world
Hated by one he loves braved by his brother
To cast into my teeth O I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger
And here my naked breast within a heart
If that thou best a Roman take it forth
I that denied thee gold will give my heart
Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know
When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius
BRUTUS Sheathe your dagger
Be angry when you will it shall have scope
Do what you will dishonor shall be humor
O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger as the flint bears fire
Who much enforced shows a hasty spark
And straight is cold again
CASSIUS Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus
CASSIUS Do you confess so much Give me your hand
BRUTUS And my heart too
CASSIUS O Brutus
CASSIUS Have not you love enough to bear with me
When that rash humor which my mother gave me
Makes me forgetful
BRUTUS Yes Cassius and from henceforth
When you are overearnest with your Brutus
They be alone
Enter Poet followed by Lucilius Titinius and Lucius
POET For shame you generals What do you mean
Love and be friends as two such men should be
CASSIUS Ha ha How vilely doth this cynic rhyme
BRUTUS Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence
What should the wars do with these jigging fools
Companion hence
CASSIUS Away away be gone                       Exit Poet
BRUTUS Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders
Prepare to lodge their companies tonight
CASSIUS And come yourselves and bring Messala with you
Immediately to us             Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius
BRUTUS Lucius a bowl of wine                   Exit Lucius
CASSIUS I did not think you could have been so angry
BRUTUS O Cassius I am sick of many griefs
CASSIUS Of your philosophy you make no use
If you give place to accidental evils
BRUTUS No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead
CASSIUS Ha Portia
BRUTUS She is dead
O insupportable and touching loss
Upon what sickness
BRUTUS Impatient of my absence
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
CASSIUS And died so
BRUTUS Even so
CASSIUS O ye immortal gods
BRUTUS Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine
In this I bury all unkindness Cassius              Drinks
CASSIUS My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
BRUTUS Come in Titinius                        Exit Lucius
Welcome good Messala
Now sit we close about this taper here
And call in question our necessities
CASSIUS Portia art thou gone
BRUTUS No more I pray you
Messala I have here received letters
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power
Bending their expedition toward Philippi
MESSALA Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
BRUTUS With what addition
MESSALA That by proscription and bills of outlawry
Octavius Antony and Lepidus
Have put to death an hundred senators
BRUTUS There in our letters do not well agree
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions Cicero being one
CASSIUS Cicero one
MESSALA Cicero is dead
And by that order of proscription
Had you your letters from your wife my lord
BRUTUS No Messala
MESSALA Nor nothing in your letters writ of her
BRUTUS Nothing Messala
MESSALA That methinks is strange
BRUTUS Why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours
MESSALA No my lord
BRUTUS Now as you are a Roman tell me true
MESSALA Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell
For certain she is dead and by strange manner
BRUTUS Why farewell Portia We must die Messala
With meditating that she must die once
I have the patience to endure it now
MESSALA Even so great men great losses should endure
CASSIUS I have as much of this in art as you
But yet my nature could not bear it so
BRUTUS Well to our work alive What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently
CASSIUS I do not think it good
BRUTUS Your reason
CASSIUS This it is
So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers
Doing himself offense whilst we lying still
Are full of rest defense and nimbleness
BRUTUS Good reasons must of force give place to better
Do stand but in a forced affection
For they have grudged us contribution
The enemy marching along by them
By them shall make a fuller number up
From which advantage shall we cut him off
If at Philippi we do face him there
These people at our back
CASSIUS Hear me good brother
BRUTUS Under your pardon You must note beside
That we have tried the utmost of our friends
The enemy increaseth every day
We at the height are ready to decline
There is a tide in the affairs of men
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
Omitted all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries
On such a full sea are we now afloat
And we must take the current when it serves
Or lose our ventures
CASSIUS Then with your will go on
BRUTUS The deep of night is crept upon our talk
And nature must obey necessity
Which we will niggard with a little rest
There is no more to say
CASSIUS No more Good night
Early tomorrow will we rise and hence
BRUTUS Lucius
My gown                                        Exit Lucius
Farewell good Messala
Good night Titinius noble noble Cassius
Good night and good repose
CASSIUS O my dear brother
This was an ill beginning of the night
Let it not Brutus
BRUTUS Everything is well
CASSIUS Good night my lord
BRUTUS Good night good brother
TITINIUS MESSALA Good night Lord Brutus
BRUTUS Farewell everyone
Exeunt all but Brutus
Give me the gown Where is thy instrument
LUCIUS Here in the tent
Call Claudio and some other of my men
LUCIUS Varro and Claudio
Enter Varro and Claudio
VARRO Calls my lord
BRUTUS I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep
It may be I shall raise you by and by
On business to my brother Cassius
VARRO So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure
BRUTUS I would not have it so Lie down good sirs
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me
I put it in the pocket of my gown
Varro and Claudio lie down
LUCIUS I was sure your lordship did not give it me
BRUTUS Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile
And touch thy instrument a strain or two
BRUTUS It does my boy
I trouble thee too much but thou art willing
LUCIUS It is my duty sir
BRUTUS I should not urge thy duty past thy might
I know young bloods look for a time of rest
LUCIUS I have slept my lord already
BRUTUS It was well done and thou shalt sleep again
I will not hold thee long If I do live
I will be good to thee                   Music and a song
This is a sleepy tune O murtherous slumber
Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy
That plays thee music Gentle knave good night
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee
Where I left reading Here it is I think        Sits down
Enter the Ghost of Caesar
How ill this taper burns Ha who comes here
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition
It comes upon me Art thou anything
Art thou some god some angel or some devil
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare
Speak to me what thou art
GHOST Thy evil spirit Brutus
BRUTUS Why comest thou
GHOST To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi
BRUTUS Well then I shall see thee again
GHOST Ay at Philippi
BRUTUS Why I will see thee at Philippi then     Exit Ghost
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest
Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee
Boy Lucius Varro Claudio Sirs awake
Claudio
LUCIUS The strings my lord are false
BRUTUS He thinks he still is at his instrument
Lucius awake
LUCIUS My lord
BRUTUS Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out
LUCIUS My lord I do not know that I did cry
BRUTUS Yes that thou didst Didst thou see anything
LUCIUS Nothing my lord
BRUTUS Sleep again Lucius Sirrah Claudio
VARRO My lord
CLAUDIO My lord
BRUTUS Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep
VARRO CLAUDIO Did we my lord
BRUTUS Ay saw you anything
VARRO No my lord I saw nothing
CLAUDIO Nor I my lord
BRUTUS Go and commend me to my brother Cassius
Bid him set on his powers betimes before
And we will follow
VARRO CLAUDIO It shall be done my lord             Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
The plains of Philippi
Enter Octavius Antony and their Army
OCTAVIUS Now Antony our hopes are answered
You said the enemy would not come down
But keep the hills and upper regions
It proves not so Their battles are at hand
They mean to warn us at Philippi here
Answering before we do demand of them
ANTONY Tut I am in their bosoms and I know
Wherefore they do it They could be content
To visit other places and come down
With fearful bravery thinking by this face
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage
Enter a Messenger
MESSENGER Prepare you generals
The enemy comes on in gallant show
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out
And something to be done immediately
ANTONY Octavius lead your battle softly on
Upon the left hand of the even field
OCTAVIUS Upon the right hand I keep thou the left
ANTONY Why do you cross me in this exigent
OCTAVIUS I do not cross you but I will do so
March Drum Enter Brutus Cassius and their Army
Lucilius Titinius Messala and others
BRUTUS They stand and would have parley
CASSIUS Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk
OCTAVIUS Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle
ANTONY No Caesar we will answer on their charge
Make forth the generals would have some words
OCTAVIUS Stir not until the signal not until the signal
BRUTUS Words before blows Is it so countrymen
OCTAVIUS Not that we love words better as you do
BRUTUS Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius
ANTONY In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words
CASSIUS Antony
The posture of your blows are yet unknown
But for your words they rob the Hybla bees
And leave them honeyless
ANTONY Not stingless too
BRUTUS O yes and soundless too
And very wisely threat before you sting
ANTONY Villains You did not so when your vile daggers
Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind
Strooke Caesar on the neck O you flatterers
CASSIUS Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself
This tongue had not offended so today
If Cassius might have ruled
OCTAVIUS Come come the cause If arguing make us sweat
The proof of it will turn to redder drops
Look
I draw a sword against conspirators
When think you that the sword goes up again
Be well avenged or till another Caesar
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
OCTAVIUS So I hope
BRUTUS O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain
Young man thou couldst not die more honorable
CASSIUS A peevish school boy worthless of such honor
ANTONY Old Cassius still
OCTAVIUS Come Antony away
Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
If you dare fight today come to the field
If not when you have stomachs
Exeunt Octavius Antony and their Army
CASSIUS Why now blow and swell billow and swim bark
The storm is up and all is on the hazard
BRUTUS Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you
Brutus and Lucilius converse apart
CASSIUS Messala
CASSIUS Messala
This is my birthday as this very day
Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala
Be thou my witness that against my will
Upon one battle all our liberties
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion Now I change my mind
And partly credit things that do presage
Coming from Sardis on our former ensign
Who to Philippi here consorted us
This morning are they fled away and gone
And in their steads do ravens crows and kites
As we were sickly prey Their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal under which
Our army lies ready to give up the ghost
MESSALA Believe not so
CASSIUS I but believe it partly
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly
BRUTUS Even so Lucilius
CASSIUS Now most noble Brutus
The gods today stand friendly that we may
Lovers in peace lead on our days to age
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain
If we do lose this battle then is this
The very last time we shall speak together
What are you then determined to do
BRUTUS Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
But I do find it cowardly and vile
For fear of what might fall so to prevent
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below
CASSIUS Then if we lose this battle
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome
BRUTUS No Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome
He bears too great a mind But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun
And whether we shall meet again I know not
Therefore our everlasting farewell take
Forever and forever farewell Cassius
If we do meet again why we shall smile
If not why then this parting was well made
CASSIUS Forever and forever farewell Brutus
BRUTUS Why then lead on O that a man might know
But it sufficeth that the day will end
And then the end is known Come ho Away           Exeunt
SCENE II
The field of battle
Alarum Enter Brutus and Messala
BRUTUS Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills
Unto the legions on the other side             Loud alarum
Let them set on at once for I perceive
And sudden push gives them the overthrow
Ride ride Messala Let them all come down         Exeunt
SCENE III
Another part of the field
Alarums Enter Cassius and Titinius
CASSIUS O look Titinius look the villains fly
This ensign here of mine was turning back
I slew the coward and did take it from him
TITINIUS O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early
Who having some advantage on Octavius
Took it too eagerly His soldiers fell to spoil
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed
Enter Pindarus
PINDARUS Fly further off my lord fly further off
Mark Antony is in your tents my lord
Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off
CASSIUS This hill is far enough Look look Titinius
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire
TITINIUS They are my lord
CASSIUS Titinius if thou lovest me
Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
And here again that I may rest assured
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy
TITINIUS I will be here again even with a thought     Exit
CASSIUS Go Pindarus get higher on that hill
My sight was ever thick regard Titinius
And tell me what thou notest about the field
Pindarus ascends the hill
This day I breathed first time is come round
And where I did begin there shall I end
My life is run his compass Sirrah what news
CASSIUS What news
With horsemen that make to him on the spur
Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him
Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too
CASSIUS Come down behold no more
O coward that I am to live so long
Pindarus descends
Come hither sirrah
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner
And then I swore thee saving of thy life
That whatsoever I did bid thee do
Thou shouldst attempt it Come now keep thine oath
Now be a freeman and with this good sword
Stand not to answer here take thou the hilts
revenged
PINDARUS So I am free yet would not so have been
Durst I have done my will O Cassius
Far from this country Pindarus shall run
Where never Roman shall take note of him              Exit
MESSALA It is but change Titinius for Octavius
TITINIUS These tidings would well comfort Cassius
MESSALA Where did you leave him
TITINIUS All disconsolate
With Pindarus his bondman on this hill
MESSALA Is not that he that lies upon the ground
TITINIUS He lies not like the living O my heart
MESSALA Is not that he
TITINIUS No this was he Messala
But Cassius is no more O setting sun
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night
The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone
Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed
MESSALA Mistrust of good success hath done this deed
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
The things that are not O error soon conceived
Thou never comest unto a happy birth
TITINIUS What Pindarus Where art thou Pindarus
MESSALA Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet
The noble Brutus thrusting this report
For piercing steel and darts envenomed
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight
TITINIUS Hie you Messala
And I will seek for Pindarus the while        Exit Messala
Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius
Did I not meet thy friends And did not they
Put on my brows this wreath of victory
And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts
Alas thou hast misconstrued everything
But hold thee take this garland on thy brow
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I
Will do his bidding Brutus come apace
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius
Kills himself
and others
BRUTUS Where where Messala doth his body lie
MESSALA Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it
CATO He is slain
BRUTUS O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
In our own proper entrails                     Low alarums
CATO Brave Titinius
BRUTUS Are yet two Romans living such as these
The last of all the Romans fare thee well
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe moe tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay
I shall find time Cassius I shall find time
Come therefore and to Thasos send his body
His funerals shall not be in our camp
Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come
And come young Cato let us to the field
Labio and Flavio set our battles on
We shall try fortune in a second fight              Exeunt
SCENE IV
Another part of the field
Alarum Enter fighting Soldiers of both armies then Brutus young Cato
Lucilius and others
BRUTUS Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads
CATO What bastard doth not Who will go with me
I will proclaim my name about the field
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
I am the son of Marcus Cato ho
BRUTUS And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I
LUCILIUS O young and noble Cato art thou down
Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius
FIRST SOLDIER Yield or thou diest
LUCILIUS Only I yield to die
FIRST SOLDIER We must not A noble prisoner
Enter Antony
ANTONY Where is he
LUCILIUS Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough
I dare assure thee that no enemy
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus
The gods defend him from so great a shame
When you do find him or alive or dead
He will be found like Brutus like himself
ANTONY This is not Brutus friend but I assure you
A prize no less in worth Keep this man safe
Give him all kindness I had rather have
Such men my friends than enemies Go on
And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead
How everything is chanced                           Exeunt
SCENE V
Another part of the field
Enter Brutus Dardanius Clitus Strato and Volumnius
BRUTUS Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock
BRUTUS Sit thee down Clitus Slaying is the word
It is a deed in fashion Hark thee Clitus        Whispers
CLITUS What I my lord No not for all the world
BRUTUS Peace then no words
BRUTUS Hark thee Dardanius                        Whispers
DARDANIUS Shall I do such a deed
CLITUS O Dardanius
DARDANIUS O Clitus
CLITUS What ill request did Brutus make to thee
DARDANIUS To kill him Clitus Look he meditates
CLITUS Now is that noble vessel full of grief
That it runs over even at his eyes
BRUTUS Come hither good Volumnius list a word
VOLUMNIUS What says my lord
BRUTUS Why this Volumnius
Two several times by night at Sardis once
And this last night here in Philippi fields
I know my hour is come
VOLUMNIUS Not so my lord
BRUTUS Nay I am sure it is Volumnius
Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes
Our enemies have beat us to the pit            Low alarums
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius
Even for that our love of old I prithee
Alarum still
CLITUS Fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here
BRUTUS Farewell to you and you and you Volumnius
Strato thou hast been all this while asleep
Farewell to thee too Strato Countrymen
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto
Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest
CLITUS Fly my lord fly
BRUTUS Hence I will follow
Exeunt Clitus Dardanius and Volumnius
I prithee Strato stay thou by thy lord
Thou art a fellow of a good respect
Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it
Hold then my sword and turn away thy face
While I do run upon it Wilt thou Strato
STRATO Give me your hand first Fare you well my lord
BRUTUS Farewell good Strato              Runs on his sword
Caesar now be still
Alarum Retreat Enter Octavius Antony Messala
Lucilius and the Army
OCTAVIUS What man is that
STRATO Free from the bondage you are in Messala
The conquerors can but make a fire of him
For Brutus only overcame himself
And no man else hath honor by his death
LUCILIUS So Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus
OCTAVIUS All that served Brutus I will entertain them
Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me
STRATO Ay if Messala will prefer me to you
OCTAVIUS Do so good Messala
MESSALA How died my master Strato
STRATO I held the sword and he did run on it
MESSALA Octavius then take him to follow thee
That did the latest service to my master
ANTONY This was the noblest Roman of them all
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar
He only in a general honest thought
And common good to all made one of them
His life was gentle and the elements
OCTAVIUS According to his virtue let us use him
With all respect and rites of burial
Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie
Most like a soldier ordered honorably
To part the glories of this happy day              Exeunt

ACT I Scene I
Kent I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
Cornwall
Glou It did always seem so to us but now in the division of the
kingdom it appears not which of the Dukes he values most for
Kent Is not this your son my lord
Glou His breeding sir hath been at my charge I have so often
Kent I cannot conceive you
had a husband for her bed Do you smell a fault
Kent I cannot wish the fault undone the issue of it being so
proper
Glou But I have sir a son by order of law some year elder than
this who yet is no dearer in my account Though this knave came
something saucily into the world before he was sent for yet was
his mother fair there was good sport at his making and the
Edmund
Glou My Lord of Kent Remember him hereafter as my honourable
friend
Edm My services to your lordship
Kent I must love you and sue to know you better
Edm Sir I shall study deserving
Glou He hath been out nine years and away he shall again
Sound a sennet
The King is coming
Enter one bearing a coronet then Lear then the Dukes of
Albany and Cornwall next Goneril Regan Cordelia with
Followers
Lear Attend the lords of France and Burgundy Gloucester
Glou I shall my liege
Lear Meantime we shall express our darker purpose
Give me the map there Know we have divided
To shake all cares and business from our age
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
And you our no less loving son of Albany
We have this hour a constant will to publish
May be prevented now The princes France and Burgundy
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn
Which of you shall we say doth love us most
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge Goneril
Gon Sir I love you more than words can wield the matter
Dearer than eyesight space and liberty
Beyond what can be valued rich or rare
No less than life with grace health beauty honour
A love that makes breath poor and speech unable
Beyond all manner of so much I love you
Lear Of all these bounds even from this line to this
Our dearest Regan wife to Cornwall Speak
Reg Sir I am made
Of the selfsame metal that my sister is
And prize me at her worth In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love
Only she comes too short that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses
And find I am alone felicitate
More richer than my tongue
Lear To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom
No less in space validity and pleasure
Although the last not least to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interest what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters Speak
Cor Nothing my lord
Lear Nothing
Cor Nothing
Lear Nothing can come of nothing Speak again
Cor Unhappy that I am I cannot heave
My heart into my mouth I love your Majesty
According to my bond no more nor less
Lear How how Cordelia Mend your speech a little
Lest it may mar your fortunes
Cor Good my lord
Return those duties back as are right fit
Obey you love you and most honour you
Why have my sisters husbands if they say
They love you all Haply when I shall wed
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
Half my love with him half my care and duty
Sure I shall never marry like my sisters
To love my father all
Lear But goes thy heart with this
Cor Ay good my lord
Lear So young and so untender
Cor So young my lord and true
Lear Let it be so thy truth then be thy dower
For by the sacred radiance of the sun
The mysteries of Hecate and the night
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be
Here I disclaim all my paternal care
Propinquity and property of blood
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever The barbarous Scythian
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite shall to my bosom
As thou my sometime daughter
Lear Peace Kent
Come not between the dragon and his wrath
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Call Burgundy Cornwall and Albany
Let pride which she calls plainness marry her
I do invest you jointly in my power
Preeminence and all the large effects
That troop with majesty Ourself by monthly course
With reservation of an hundred knights
Make with you by due turns Only we still retain
Revenue execution of the rest
Beloved sons be yours which to confirm
This coronet part betwixt you
Kent Royal Lear
Lear The bow is bent and drawn make from the shaft
Kent Let it fall rather though the fork invade
The region of my heart Be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad What wouldst thou do old man
When majesty falls to folly Reverse thy doom
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness Answer my life my judgment
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least
Reverbs no hollowness
Lear Kent on thy life no more
Kent My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies nor fear to lose it
Thy safety being the motive
Lear Out of my sight
Kent See better Lear and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye
Kent Now by Apollo King
Lear O vassal miscreant
Alb Corn Dear sir forbear
Kent Do
Kill thy physician and the fee bestow
Upon the foul disease Revoke thy gift
Or whilst I can vent clamour from my throat
Lear Hear me recreant
On thine allegiance hear me
Our potency made good take thy reward
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom If on the tenth day following
The moment is thy death Away By Jupiter
Kent Fare thee well King Since thus thou wilt appear
Freedom lives hence and banishment is here
approve
That good effects may spring from words of love
Thus Kent O princes bids you all adieu
Exit
Flourish Enter Gloucester with France and Burgundy Attendants
Lear My Lord of Burgundy
We first address toward you who with this king
Will you require in present dower with her
Or cease your quest of love
Bur Most royal Majesty
Nor will you tender less
Lear Right noble Burgundy
When she was dear to us we did hold her so
If aught within that little seeming substance
And nothing more may fitly like your Grace
Bur I know no answer
Lear Will you with those infirmities she owes
Unfriended new adopted to our hate
Take her or leave her
Bur Pardon me royal sir
Election makes not up on such conditions
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate therefore beseech you
France This is most strange
That she that even but now was your best object
The argument of your praise balm of your age
Most best most dearest should in this trice of time
Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
So many folds of favour Sure her offence
Must be of such unnatural degree
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
Should never plant in me
Cor I yet beseech your Majesty
If for I want that glib and oily art
To speak and purpose not since what I well intend
It is no vicious blot murther or foulness
No unchaste action or dishonoured step
As I am glad I have not though not to have it
Hath lost me in your liking
Lear Better thou
Which often leaves the history unspoke
That it intends to do My Lord of Burgundy
When it is mingled with regards that stands
She is herself a dowry
Bur Royal Lear
And here I take Cordelia by the hand
Duchess of Burgundy
Lear Nothing I have sworn I am firm
Bur I am sorry then you have so lost a father
That you must lose a husband
Cor Peace be with Burgundy
Since that respects of fortune are his love
I shall not be his wife
France Fairest Cordelia that art most rich being poor
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon
Is queen of us of ours and our fair France
Bid them farewell Cordelia though unkind
Thou losest here a better where to find
Lear Thou hast her France let her be thine for we
Have no such daughter nor shall ever see
That face of hers again Therefore be gone
Without our grace our love our benison
Come noble Burgundy
France Bid farewell to your sisters
Cordelia leaves you I know you what you are
And like a sister am most loath to call
To your professed bosoms I commit him
But yet alas stood I within his grace
I would prefer him to a better place
So farewell to you both
Gon Prescribe not us our duties
Reg Let your study
And well are worth the want that you have wanted
Cor Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides
Who cover faults at last shame them derides
Well may you prosper
France Come my fair Cordelia
Exeunt France and Cordelia
Gon Sister it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
Gon You see how full of changes his age is The observation we
sister most and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly
known himself
Gon The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash then
must we look to receive from his age not alone the
the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with
them
Reg Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
with such dispositions as he bears this last surrender of his
will but offend us
Exeunt
Scene II
Edm Thou Nature art my goddess to thy law
My services are bound Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother Why bastard wherefore base
When my dimensions are as well compact
My mind as generous and my shape as true
With base with baseness bastardy base base
Who in the lusty stealth of nature take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth within a dull stale tired bed
Legitimate Edgar I must have your land
Well my legitimate if this letter speed
And my invention thrive Edmund the base
Now gods stand up for bastards
Enter Gloucester
Upon the gad Edmund how now What news
Edm So please your lordship none
Glou Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter
Edm I know no news my lord
Glou What paper were you reading
Edm Nothing my lord
Glou No What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your
pocket The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide
spectacles
Edm I beseech you sir pardon me It is a letter from my brother
Glou Give me the letter sir
Edm I shall offend either to detain or give it The contents as
in part I understand them are to blame
an essay or taste of my virtue
bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us
till our oldness cannot relish them I begin to find an idle
and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways
of this I may speak more If our father would sleep till I
the beloved of your brother
and brain to breed it in When came this to you Who brought it
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet
Edm If the matter were good my lord I durst swear it were his
but in respect of that I would fain think it were not
Glou It is his
Edm It is his hand my lord but I hope his heart is not in the
contents
Glou Hath he never before sounded you in this business
Edm Never my lord But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father
should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
Glou O villain villain His very opinion in the letter Abhorred
villain Unnatural detested brutish villain worse than
villain Where is he
Edm I do not well know my lord If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course
where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his
purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour and to no other pretence of danger
Glou Think you so
Edm If your honour judge it meet I will place you where you shall
hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very
evening
Glou He cannot be such a monster
Edm Nor is not sure
Glou To his father that so tenderly and entirely loves him
Heaven and earth Edmund seek him out wind me into him I pray
you frame the business after your own wisdom I would unstate
myself to be in a due resolution
Edm I will seek him sir presently convey the business as I
shall find means and acquaint you withal
Glou These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to
us Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet
friendship falls off brothers divide In cities mutinies in
of our time Machinations hollowness treachery and all
ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves Find out
this villain Edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it
Edm This is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are
sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make
guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if
we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion
planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine
his goatish disposition to the charge of a star My father
nativity was under Ursa Major so that it follows I am rough and
lecherous Fut I should have been that I am had the
maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing
Enter Edgar
and pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old comedy My
O these eclipses do portend these divisions Fa sol la mi
Edg How now brother Edmund What serious contemplation are you
Edm I am thinking brother of a prediction I read this other day
what should follow these eclipses
Edg Do you busy yourself with that
Edm I promise you the effects he writes of succeed unhappily as
of unnaturalness between the child and the parent death
dearth dissolutions of ancient amities divisions in state
menaces and maledictions against king and nobles needless
diffidences banishment of friends dissipation of cohorts
nuptial breaches and I know not what
Edg How long have you been a sectary astronomical
Edm Come come When saw you my father last
Edg The night gone by
Edm Spake you with him
Edg Ay two hours together
Edm Parted you in good terms Found you no displeasure in him by
word or countenance
Edg None at all
Edm Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay
Edg Some villain hath done me wrong
the speed of his rage goes slower and as I say retire with me
to my lodging from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my
if there be any good meaning toward you I have told you what I
have seen and heard but faintly nothing like the image and
horror of it Pray you away
Edg Shall I hear from you anon
Edm I do serve you in this business
Exit Edgar
A credulous father and a brother noble
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy I see the business
Let me if not by birth have lands by wit
Exit
Scene III
Gon Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool
Osw Ay madam
Gon By day and night he wrongs me Every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
His knights grow riotous and himself upbraids us
On every trifle When he returns from hunting
I will not speak with him Say I am sick
If you come slack of former services
Gon Put on what weary negligence you please
If he distaste it let him to our sister
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away Now by my life
Remember what I have said
Osw Very well madam
Gon And let his knights have colder looks among you
What grows of it no matter Advise your fellows so
I would breed from hence occasions and I shall
To hold my very course Prepare for dinner
Exeunt

and your daughter
Knight I beseech you pardon me my lord if I be mistaken for
perceived a most faint neglect of late which I have rather
blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
hath much pined away

bids me though you say nothing Mum mum
He that keeps nor crust nor crum
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel breaking forth
I had thought by making this well known unto you
To have found a safe redress but now grow fearful
By what yourself too late have spoke and done
That you protect this course and put it on
By your allowance which if you should the fault
Would not scape censure nor the redresses sleep
Which in the tender of a wholesome weal
Might in their working do you that offence
Which else were shame that then necessity
Must call discreet proceeding
Fool For you know nuncle
That it had it head bit off by it young
So out went the candle and we were left darkling
Lear Are you our daughter
Gon Come sir
I would you would make use of that good wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught and put away
These dispositions that of late transform you
From what you rightly are
Fool May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse
Whoop Jug I love thee
Lear Doth any here know me This is not Lear
Doth Lear walk thus speak thus Where are his eyes
Either his notion weakens his discernings
Who is it that can tell me who I am
Lear I would learn that for by the marks of sovereignty
Knowledge and reason I should be false persuaded
I had daughters
Fool Which they will make an obedient father
Lear Your name fair gentlewoman
Of other your new pranks I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright
As you are old and reverend you should be wise
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires
That this our court infected with their manners
Shows like a riotous inn Epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
By her that else will take the thing she begs
A little to disquantity your train
And the remainder that shall still depend
To be such men as may besort your age
Which know themselves and you
Lear Darkness and devils
Saddle my horses Call my train together
Yet have I left a daughter
Make servants of their betters
Enter Albany
Alb Pray sir be patient
My train are men of choice and rarest parts
That all particulars of duty know
And in the most exact regard support
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show
And added to the gall O Lear Lear Lear
And thy dear judgment out Go go my people
Alb My lord I am guiltless as I am ignorant
Lear It may be so my lord
Hear Nature hear dear goddess hear
Suspend thy purpose if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful
Into her womb convey sterility
Dry up in her the organs of increase
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her If she must teem
Create her child of spleen that it may live
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks
To laughter and contempt that she may feel
To have a thankless child Away away                Exit
Alb Now gods that we adore whereof comes this
Gon Never afflict yourself to know the cause
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it
Enter Lear
Lear What fifty of my followers at a clap
Within a fortnight
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus
That these hot tears which break from me perforce
Should make thee worth them Blasts and fogs upon thee
And cast you with the waters that you lose
To temper clay Yea is it come to this
Let it be so Yet have I left a daughter
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable
When she shall hear this of thee with her nails
I have cast off for ever thou shalt I warrant thee
Gon Do you mark that my lord
Alb I cannot be so partial Goneril
Fool Nuncle Lear nuncle Lear tarry Take the fool with thee
A fox when one has caught her
And such a daughter
Should sure to the slaughter
If my cap would buy a halter
So the fool follows after                       Exit
Gon This man hath had good counsel A hundred knights
At point a hundred knights yes that on every dream
Each buzz each fancy each complaint dislike
Alb Well you may fear too far
Gon Safer than trust too far
Let me still take away the harms I fear
Not fear still to be taken I know his heart
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
How now Oswald
What have you writ that letter to my sister
Osw Yes madam
Gon Take you some company and away to horse
Inform her full of my particular fear
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more Get you gone
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn it not yet under pardon
You are much more at task for want of wisdom
Alb How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell

ACT II Scene I
A court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester
Edm Save thee Curan
Cur And you sir I have been with your father and given him
notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be
here with him this night
Edm How comes that
Edm Not I Pray you what are they
of Cornwall and Albany
Edm Not a word
Cur You may do then in time Fare you well sir      Exit
This weaves itself perforce into my business
My father hath set guard to take my brother
And I have one thing of a queasy question
Which I must act Briefness and fortune work
Brother a word Descend Brother I say
Enter Edgar
My father watches O sir fly this place
Intelligence is given where you are hid
You have now the good advantage of the night
And Regan with him Have you nothing said
Advise yourself
Edm I hear my father coming Pardon me
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Yield Come before my father Light ho here
Exit Edgar
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
drunkards
Stop stop No help
Enter Gloucester and Servants with torches
Edm Here stood he in the dark his sharp sword out
Mumbling of wicked charms conjuring the moon
Glou But where is he
Edm Look sir I bleed
Glou Where is the villain Edmund
By no means what
Edm Persuade me to the murther of your lordship
But that I told him the revenging gods
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
Or whether gasted by the noise I made
Full suddenly he fled
Glou Let him fly far
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught
By his authority I will proclaim it
That he which find him shall deserve our thanks
Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake
He that conceals him death
Edm When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it with curst speech
If I would stand against thee would the reposal
Of any trust virtue or worth in thee
To thy suggestion plot and damned practice
And thou must make a dullard of the world
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
Would he deny his letter I never got him
Tucket within
The Duke must grant me that Besides his picture
I will send far and near that all the kingdom
May have due note of him and of my land
To make thee capable
Enter Cornwall Regan and Attendants
Corn How now my noble friend Since I came hither
Reg If it be true all vengeance comes too short
Glou O lady lady shame would have it hid
Reg Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father
Edm Yes madam he was of that consort
Reg No marvel then though he were ill affected
I have this present evening from my sister
That if they come to sojourn at my house
Corn Nor I assure thee Regan
Edmund I hear that you have shown your father
A childlike office
This hurt you see striving to apprehend him
Corn Is he pursued
Glou Ay my good lord
Corn If he be taken he shall never more
How in my strength you please For you Edmund
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself you shall be ours
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need
You we first seize on
Edm I shall serve you sir
Truly however else
Glou For him I thank your Grace
Occasions noble Gloucester of some poise
Wherein we must have use of your advice
Our father he hath writ so hath our sister
Of differences which I best thought it fit
To answer from our home The several messengers
From hence attend dispatch Our good old friend
Lay comforts to your bosom and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business
Which craves the instant use
Glou I serve you madam
Your Graces are right welcome
Exeunt Flourish
Scene II
Osw Good dawning to thee friend Art of this house
Kent Ay
Osw Where may we set our horses
Kent I love thee not
Osw Why then I care not for thee
Kent If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold I would make thee care for
Osw Why dost thou use me thus I know thee not
Kent Fellow I know thee
Osw What dost thou know me for
Kent A knave a rascal an eater of broken meats a base proud
good service and art nothing but the composition of a knave
beggar coward pander and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch
one whom I will beat into clamorous whining if thou deny the
least syllable of thy addition
Osw Why what a monstrous fellow art thou thus to rail on one
draw
Osw Away I have nothing to do with thee
Kent Draw you rascal You come with letters against the King and
rascal Come your ways
Osw Help ho murther help
Kent Strike you slave Stand rogue Stand you neat slave
Osw Help ho murther murther
Enter Edmund with his rapier drawn Gloucester Cornwall
Regan Servants
Come on young master
Corn Keep peace upon your lives
He dies that strikes again What is the matter
Reg The messengers from our sister and the King
Corn What is your difference Speak
Osw I am scarce in breath my lord
rascal nature disclaims in thee a tailor made thee
Corn Thou art a strange fellow A tailor make a man
Kent Ay a tailor sir A stonecutter or a painter could not have
made him so ill though he had been but two hours at the trade
Corn Speak yet how grew your quarrel
Kent Thou whoreson zed thou unnecessary letter My lord if
Corn Peace sirrah
You beastly knave know you no reverence
Kent Yes sir but anger hath a privilege
Corn Why art thou angry
Kent That such a slave as this should wear a sword
Who wears no honesty Such smiling rogues as these
Like rats oft bite the holy cords atwain
That in the natures of their lords rebel
Bring oil to fire snow to their colder moods
Renege affirm and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters
A plague upon your epileptic visage
Smile you my speeches as I were a fool
Goose an I had you upon Sarum Plain
Corn What art thou mad old fellow
Glou How fell you out Say that
Kent No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave
Corn Why dost thou call him knave What is his fault
Kent His countenance likes me not
Corn No more perchance does mine or his or hers
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant
Corn This is some fellow
A saucy roughness and constrains the garb
Quite from his nature He cannot flatter he
These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
That stretch their duties nicely
Kent Sir in good faith in sincere verity
Whose influence like the wreath of radiant fire
Kent To go out of my dialect which you discommend so much I
accent was a plain knave which for my part I will not be
Osw I never gave him any
To strike at me upon his misconstruction
When he conjunct and flattering his displeasure
And put upon him such a deal of man
That worthied him got praises of the King
And in the fleshment of this dread exploit
Drew on me here again
Kent None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool
Corn Fetch forth the stocks
You stubborn ancient knave you reverent braggart
Kent Sir I am too old to learn
Call not your stocks for me I serve the King
On whose employment I was sent to you
You shall do small respect show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master
Stocking his messenger
Corn Fetch forth the stocks As I have life and honour
There shall he sit till noon
Reg Till noon Till night my lord and all night too
You should not use me so
Reg Sir being his knave I will
Corn This is a fellow of the selfsame colour
Our sister speaks of Come bring away the stocks
Stocks brought out
Glou Let me beseech your Grace not to do so
His fault is much and the good King his master
That he so slightly valued in his messenger
Reg My sister may receive it much more worse
Come my good lord away
Whose disposition all the world well knows
Give you good morrow
Exit
Kent Good King that must approve the common saw
To the warm sun
Approach thou beacon to this under globe
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter Nothing almost sees miracles
From this enormous state seeking to give
Take vantage heavy eyes not to behold
This shameful lodging
Fortune good night smile once more turn thy wheel
Sleeps
Scene III
The open country
Enter Edgar
And by the happy hollow of a tree
That guard and most unusual vigilance
Does not attend my taking Whiles I may scape
I will preserve myself and am bethought
To take the basest and most poorest shape
That ever penury in contempt of man
Blanket my loins elf all my hair in knots
And with presented nakedness outface
The winds and persecutions of the sky
The country gives me proof and precedent
Of Bedlam beggars who with roaring voices
Pins wooden pricks nails sprigs of rosemary
And with this horrible object from low farms
Poor pelting villages sheepcotes and mills
Sometime with lunatic bans sometime with prayers
Scene IV
Enter Lear Fool and Gentleman
And not send back my messenger
The night before there was no purpose in them
Of this remove
Kent Hail to thee noble master
Lear Ha
Kent No my lord
Fool Ha ha look he wears cruel garters Horses are tied by the
To set thee here
Your son and daughter
Lear No
Kent Yes
Lear No I say
Kent I say yea
Lear No no they would not
Kent Yes they have
Lear By Jupiter I swear no
Kent By Juno I swear ay
To do upon respect such violent outrage
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage
Coming from us
Kent My lord when at their home
My duty kneeling came there a reeking post
From Goneril his mistress salutations
Which presently they read on whose contents
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer gave me cold looks
And meeting here the other messenger
Being the very fellow which of late
Having more man than wit about me drew
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind
Fortune that arrant whore
But for all this thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
daughters as thou canst tell in a year
Lear O how this mother swells up toward my heart
Hysterica passio Down thou climbing sorrow
Kent With the Earl sir here within
Lear Follow me not
Stay here                                            Exit
Gent Made you no more offence but what you speak of
Kent None
How chance the King comes with so small a number
Kent Why fool
wheel runs down a hill lest it break thy neck with following
it but the great one that goes upward let him draw thee after
When a wise man gives thee better counsel give me mine again I
would have none but knaves follow it since a fool gives it
That sir which serves and seeks for gain
And follows but for form
Will pack when it begins to rain
And leave thee in the storm
But I will tarry the fool will stay
And let the wise man fly
The knave turns fool that runs away
The fool no knave perdy
Enter Lear and Gloucester
Lear Deny to speak with me They are sick they are weary
The images of revolt and flying off
Fetch me a better answer
Glou My dear lord
You know the fiery quality of the Duke
In his own course
Lear Vengeance plague death confusion
Fiery What quality Why Gloucester Gloucester
Glou Ay my good lord
Lear The King would speak with Cornwall the dear father
Would with his daughter speak commands her service
No but not yet May be he is not well
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound We are not ourselves
And am fallen out with my more headier will
Should be sit here This act persuades me
That this remotion of the Duke and her
Is practice only Give me my servant forth
Now presently Bid them come forth and hear me
Till it cry sleep to death
Glou I would have all well betwixt you                 Exit
Lear O me my heart my rising heart But down
Fool Cry to it nuncle as the cockney did to the eels when she
in pure kindness to his horse buttered his hay
Enter Cornwall Regan Gloucester Servants
Lear Good morrow to you both
Corn Hail to your Grace
Kent here set at liberty
Reg I am glad to see your Highness
Lear Regan I think you are I know what reason
I have to think so If thou shouldst not be glad
Reg I pray you sir take patience I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty
Lear Say how is that
Reg I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation If sir perchance
As clears her from all blame
Lear My curses on her
Reg O sir you are old
Nature in you stands on the very verge
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return
Lear Ask her forgiveness
Do you but mark how this becomes the house
Age is unnecessary On my knees I beg
Reg Good sir no more These are unsightly tricks
Return you to my sister
She hath abated me of half my train
On her ingrateful top Strike her young bones
You taking airs with lameness
Corn Fie sir fie
Lear You nimble lightnings dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes Infect her beauty
To fall and blast her pride
Reg O the blest gods so will you wish on me
When the rash mood is on
Lear No Regan thou shalt never have my curse
To grudge my pleasures to cut off my train
To bandy hasty words to scant my sizes
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
The offices of nature bond of childhood
Effects of courtesy dues of gratitude
Tucket within
That she would soon be here
Is your lady come
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows
Out varlet from my sight
Corn What means your Grace
Enter Goneril
If you do love old men if your sweet sway
Make it your cause Send down and take my part
O Regan wilt thou take her by the hand
And dotage terms so
Lear O sides you are too tough
Corn I set him there sir but his own disorders
Lear You Did you
Reg I pray you father being weak seem so
If till the expiration of your month
You will return and sojourn with my sister
Dismissing half your train come then to me
I am now from home and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment
No rather I abjure all roofs and choose
Our youngest born I could as well be brought
To keep base life afoot Return with her
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
Gon At your choice sir
Lear I prithee daughter do not make me mad
I will not trouble thee my child farewell
But yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter
Which I must needs call mine Thou art a boil
A plague sore an embossed carbuncle
Let shame come when it will I do not call it
Mend when thou canst be better at thy leisure
I can be patient I can stay with Regan
I and my hundred knights
Reg Not altogether so
For your fit welcome Give ear sir to my sister
For those that mingle reason with your passion
But she knows what she does
Lear Is this well spoken
Reg I dare avouch it sir What fifty followers
Is it not well What should you need of more
Yea or so many sith that both charge and danger
Should many people under two commands
Gon Why might not you my lord receive attendance
From those that she calls servants or from mine
We could control them If you will come to me
Will I give place or notice
Reg And in good time you gave it
Lear Made you my guardians my depositaries
But kept a reservation to be followed
With such a number What must I come to you
When others are more wicked not being the worst
And thou art twice her love
Gon Hear me my lord
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you
Reg What need one
Lear O reason not the need Our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous
Allow not nature more than nature needs
If only to go warm were gorgeous
You heavens give me that patience patience I need
You see me here you gods a poor old man
As full of grief as age wretched in both
Against their father fool me not so much
To bear it tamely touch me with noble anger
I will have such revenges on you both
What they are yet I know not but they shall be
I have full cause of weeping but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Exeunt Lear Gloucester Kent and Fool Storm and
tempest
And must needs taste his folly
But not one follower
Where is my Lord of Gloucester
Corn Followed the old man forth
Enter Gloucester
Glou The King is in high rage
Corn Whither is he going
Glou He calls to horse but will I know not whither
Gon My lord entreat him by no means to stay
Glou Alack the night comes on and the bleak winds
Do sorely ruffle For many miles about
Reg O sir to wilful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters Shut up your doors
He is attended with a desperate train
And what they may incense him to being apt

ACT III Scene I
A heath
Storm still Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors
Gent One minded like the weather most unquietly
Gent Contending with the fretful elements
Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea
That things might change or cease tears his white hair
Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
Catch in their fury and make nothing of
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
Keep their fur dry unbonneted he runs
And bids what will take all
Kent But who is with him
Gent None but the fool who labours to outjest
Kent Sir I do know you
And dare upon the warrant of my note
Commend a dear thing to you There is division
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state What hath been seen
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind King or something deeper
But true it is from France there comes a power
Into this scattered kingdom who already
Wise in our negligence have secret feet
In some of our best ports and are at point
To show their open banner Now to you
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover you shall find
Some that will thank you making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The King hath cause to plain
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
This office to you
Gent I will talk further with you
Kent No do not
For confirmation that I am much more
What it contains If you shall see Cordelia
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know Fie on this storm
I will go seek the King
Gent Give me your hand Have you no more to say
Kent Few words but to effect more than all yet
Holla the other
Scene II
Another part of the heath
Storm still Enter Lear and Fool
Lear Blow winds and crack your cheeks rage blow
You cataracts and hurricanoes spout
That makes ingrateful man
Fool O nuncle court holy water in a dry house is better than this
Lear Rumble thy bellyful Spit fire spout rain
Nor rain wind thunder fire are my daughters
I tax not you you elements with unkindness
You owe me no subscription Then let fall
Your horrible pleasure Here I stand your slave
But yet I call you servile ministers
That will with two pernicious daughters join
The codpiece that will house
Before the head has any
The head and he shall louse
So beggars marry many
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe
And turn his sleep to wake
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
glass
Enter Kent
Lear No I will be the pattern of all patience
I will say nothing
fool
Kent Alas sir are you here Things that love night
Love not such nights as these The wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves Since I was man
Such sheets of fire such bursts of horrid thunder
Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
Lear Let the great gods
Find out their enemies now Tremble thou wretch
That hast within thee undivulged crimes
That art incestuous Caitiff in pieces shake
That under covert and convenient seeming
Rive your concealing continents and cry
These dreadful summoners grace I am a man
Kent Alack bareheaded
Gracious my lord hard by here is a hovel
Repose you there whilst I to this hard house
Which even but now demanding after you
Their scanted courtesy
Lear My wits begin to turn
Come on my boy How dost my boy Art cold
I am cold myself Where is this straw my fellow
The art of our necessities is strange
That can make vile things precious Come your hovel
Poor fool and knave I have one part in my heart
Must make content with his fortunes fit
For the rain it raineth every day
Lear True my good boy Come bring us to this hovel
prophecy ere I go
When priests are more in word than matter
When brewers mar their malt with water
When every case in law is right
No squire in debt nor no poor knight
When slanders do not live in tongues
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs
And bawds and whores do churches build
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion
This prophecy Merlin shall make for I live before his time
Exit
Scene III
Enter Gloucester and Edmund
Glou Alack alack Edmund I like not this unnatural dealing When
displeasure neither to speak of him entreat for him nor any
way sustain him
Edm Most savage and unnatural
Glou Go to say you nothing There is division betwixt the Dukes
and a worse matter than that I have received a letter this
my closet These injuries the King now bears will be revenged
the King I will seek him and privily relieve him Go you and
maintain talk with the Duke that my charity be not of him
perceived If he ask for me I am ill and gone to bed Though I
must be relieved There is some strange thing toward Edmund
Pray you be careful                                  Exit
Edm This courtesy forbid thee shall the Duke
Instantly know and of that letter too
This seems a fair deserving and must draw me
The younger rises when the old doth fall             Exit
Scene IV
The heath Before a hovel
Storm still Enter Lear Kent and Fool
Kent Here is the place my lord Good my lord enter
For nature to endure
Lear Let me alone
Kent Good my lord enter here
Lear Wilt break my heart
Kent I had rather break mine own Good my lord enter
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there Filial ingratitude
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
No I will weep no more In such a night
In such a night as this O Regan Goneril
Your old kind father whose frank heart gave all
O that way madness lies let me shun that
No more of that
Kent Good my lord enter here
Lear Prithee go in thyself seek thine own ease
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides
Too little care of this Take physic pomp
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
And show the heavens more just
Come forth
Edg Away the foul fiend follows me Through the sharp hawthorn
blows the cold wind Humh go to thy cold bed and warm thee
Lear Hast thou given all to thy two daughters and art thou come
to this
Edg Who gives anything to poor Tom whom the foul fiend hath led
bog and quagmire that hath laid knives under his pillow and
halters in his pew set ratsbane by his porridge made him proud
bridges to course his own shadow for a traitor Bless thy five
Storm still
Lear What have his daughters brought him to this pass
Lear Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Kent He hath no daughters sir
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh
Those pelican daughters
Fool This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen
Lear What hast thou been
did the act of darkness with her swore as many oaths as I spake
words and broke them in the sweet face of heaven one that
False of heart light of ear bloody of hand hog in sloth fox
in stealth wolf in greediness dog in madness lion in prey
Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
thy poor heart to woman Keep thy foot out of brothel thy hand
fiend Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind says
suum mun hey no nonny Dolphin my boy my boy sessa let
him trot by
Storm still
Lear Why thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare forked
animal as thou art Off off you lendings Come unbutton
here
comes a walking fire
Enter Gloucester with a torch
Edg This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet He begins at curfew
and walks till the first cock He gives the web and the pin
squints the eye and makes the harelip mildews the white wheat
and hurts the poor creature of earth
He met the nightmare and her nine fold
Bid her alight
And her troth plight
And aroint thee witch aroint thee
Kent How fares your Grace
Glou What are you there Your names
Edg Poor Tom that eats the swimming frog the toad the todpole
back six shirts to his body horse to ride and weapons to
wear
But mice and rats and such small deer
Beware my follower Peace Smulkin peace thou fiend
Glou What hath your Grace no better company
Edg The prince of darkness is a gentleman
Glou Our flesh and blood is grown so vile my lord
That it doth hate what gets it
Glou Go in with me My duty cannot suffer
Though their injunction be to bar my doors
And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you
And bring you where both fire and food is ready
Lear First let me talk with this philosopher
What is the cause of thunder
What is your study
Edg How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin
Lear Let me ask you one word in private
Kent Importune him once more to go my lord
Glou Canst thou blame him
Storm still
His daughters seek his death Ah that good Kent
I am almost mad myself I had a son
No father his son dearer True to tell thee
Lear O cry you mercy sir
Noble philosopher your company
Kent This way my lord
Lear With him
I will keep still with my philosopher
Kent Good my lord soothe him let him take the fellow
Glou Take him you on
Kent Sirrah come on go along with us
Lear Come good Athenian
Glou No words no words hush
Edg Child Rowland to the dark tower came
His word was still
Fie foh and fum
I smell the blood of a British man
Exeunt
Scene V
Enter Cornwall and Edmund
Corn I will have my revenge ere I depart his house
Edm How my lord I may be censured that nature thus gives way to
loyalty something fears me to think of
disposition made him seek his death but a provoking merit set
awork by a reproveable badness in himself
Edm How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just
This is the letter he spoke of which approves him an
intelligent party to the advantages of France O heavens that
Corn Go with me to the Duchess
Edm If the matter of this paper be certain you have mighty
business in hand
Corn True or false it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester
Seek out where thy father is that he may be ready for our
apprehension
though the conflict be sore between that and my blood
Corn I will lay trust upon thee and thou shalt find a dearer
father in my love
Exeunt
Scene VI
Enter Gloucester Lear Kent Fool and Edgar
Glou Here is better than the open air take it thankfully I will
piece out the comfort with what addition I can I will not be
long from you
Kent All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience
The gods reward your kindness
Edg Frateretto calls me and tells me Nero is an angler in the
lake of darkness Pray innocent and beware the foul fiend
Fool Prithee nuncle tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a
yeoman
Lear A king a king
mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him
Lear To have a thousand with red burning spits
Edg The foul fiend bites my back
Lear It shall be done I will arraign them straight
madam
Fool      Her boat hath a leak
And she must not speak
Why she dares not come over to thee
Edg The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale
not black angel I have no food for thee
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions
Sit you too
Edg Let us deal justly
Sleepest or wakest thou jolly shepherd
Thy sheep be in the corn
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
Thy sheep shall take no harm
Purr the cat is gray
this honourable assembly she kicked the poor King her father
Fool Come hither mistress Is your name Goneril
Lear She cannot deny it
What store her heart is made on Stop her there
Arms arms sword fire Corruption in the place
False justicer why hast thou let her scape
Edg Bless thy five wits
Kent O pity Sir where is the patience now
That you so oft have boasted to retain
Lear The little dogs and all
Tray Blanch and Sweetheart see they bark at me
Edg Tom will throw his head at them Avaunt you curs
Be thy mouth or black or white
Tooth that poisons if it bite
Mastiff greyhound mongrel grim
Hound or spaniel brach or lym
Tom will make them weep and wail
For with throwing thus my head
Dogs leap the hatch and all are fled
Do de de de Sessa Come march to wakes and fairs and market
towns Poor Tom thy horn is dry
Lear Then let them anatomize Regan See what breeds about her
heart Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
Kent Now good my lord lie here and rest awhile
Lear Make no noise make no noise draw the curtains
Enter Gloucester
Glou Come hither friend Where is the King my master
Kent Here sir but trouble him not his wits are gone
Glou Good friend I prithee take him in thy arms
And drive towards Dover friend where thou shalt meet
Both welcome and protection Take up thy master
If thou shouldst dally half an hour his life
With thine and all that offer to defend him
Stand in assured loss Take up take up
And follow me that will to some provision
Give thee quick conduct
Kent Oppressed nature sleeps
Which if convenience will not allow
Thou must not stay behind
Glou Come come away
Edg When we our betters see bearing our woes
We scarcely think our miseries our foes
Leaving free things and happy shows behind
When grief hath mates and bearing fellowship
How light and portable my pain seems now
When that which makes me bend makes the King bow
He childed as I fathered Tom away
Mark the high noises and thyself bewray
When false opinion whose wrong thought defiles thee
In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee
Scene VII

Reg Hang him instantly
Gon Pluck out his eyes
Corn Leave him to my displeasure Edmund keep you our sister

father are not fit for your beholding Advise the Duke where you
are going to a most festinate preparation We are bound to the

Farewell dear sister farewell my Lord of Gloucester
Some five or six and thirty of his knights
Hot questrists after him met him at gate
Are gone with him towards Dover where they boast
Corn Get horses for your mistress
Gon Farewell sweet lord and sister
Corn Edmund farewell
Go seek the traitor Gloucester
Pinion him like a thief bring him before us
Though well we may not pass upon his life

You are my guests Do me no foul play friends
Corn Bind him I say

You should not ruffle thus What will you do
Corn Come sir what letters had you late from France
Corn And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom
Reg To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King
Speak
Glou I have a letter guessingly set down
Corn Cunning
Reg And false
Corn Where hast thou sent the King
Glou To Dover
Corn Wherefore to Dover Let him first answer that
Reg Wherefore to Dover sir
Glou Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs
The sea with such a storm as his bare head
Yet poor old heart he holp the heavens to rain
The winged vengeance overtake such children
Glou He that will think to live till he be old
1 Serv Hold your hand my lord
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold
Reg How now you dog
1 Serv If you did wear a beard upon your chin
Reg What do you mean
Corn My villain                               Draw and fight
1 Serv Nay then come on and take the chance of anger
Reg Give me thy sword A peasant stand up thus
She takes a sword and runs at him behind
1 Serv O I am slain My lord you have one eye left
To see some mischief on him O                     He dies
Corn Lest it see more prevent it Out vile jelly
Where is thy lustre now
Edmund enkindle all the sparks of nature
To quit this horrid act
Reg Out treacherous villain
That made the overture of thy treasons to us
Who is too good to pity thee
Kind gods forgive me that and prosper him
Reg Go thrust him out at gates and let him smell
His way to Dover
Turn out that eyeless villain Throw this slave
Upon the dunghill Regan I bleed apace
Untimely comes this hurt Give me your arm
If this man come to good
3 Serv If she live long
And in the end meet the old course of death
Women will all turn monsters
To lead him where he would His roguish madness
Allows itself to anything
To apply to his bleeding face Now heaven help him

ACT IV Scene I
The heath
Enter Edgar
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune
Stands still in esperance lives not in fear
The lamentable change is from the best
The worst returns to laughter Welcome then
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
Owes nothing to thy blasts
Enter Gloucester led by an Old Man
But who comes here
My father poorly led World world O world
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee
Life would not yield to age
Old Man O my good lord
These fourscore years
Glou Away get thee away Good friend be gone
Thy comforts can do me no good at all
Thee they may hurt
Old Man You cannot see your way
Glou I have no way and therefore want no eyes
Our means secure us and our mere defects
Prove our commodities Ah dear son Edgar
Might I but live to see thee in my touch
Old Man Fellow where goest
Glou Is it a beggarman
Old Man Madman and beggar too
Glou He has some reason else he could not beg
Which made me think a man a worm My son
Came then into my mind and yet my mind
Was then scarce friends with him I have heard more since
They kill us for their sport
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow
Glou Is that the naked fellow
Old Man Ay my lord
Glou Then prithee get thee gone If for my sake
And bring some covering for this naked soul
Old Man Alack sir he is mad
Do as I bid thee or rather do thy pleasure
Above the rest be gone
Glou Come hither fellow
Edg Both stile and gate horseway and footpath Poor Tom hath been
the foul fiend Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once of
lust as Obidicut Hobbididence prince of dumbness Mahu of
stealing Modo of murder Flibbertigibbet of mopping and
mowing who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women So
bless thee master
Have humbled to all strokes That I am wretched
Makes thee the happier Heavens deal so still
That slaves your ordinance that will not see
So distribution should undo excess
And each man have enough Dost thou know Dover
Edg Ay master
Glou There is a cliff whose high and bending head
Looks fearfully in the confined deep
Bring me but to the very brim of it
With something rich about me From that place
I shall no leading need
Edg Give me thy arm
Poor Tom shall lead thee
Exeunt
Scene II
Gon Welcome my lord I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way
I told him of the army that was landed
And of the loyal service of his son
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him
What like offensive
It is the cowish terror of his spirit
Which tie him to an answer Our wishes on the way
May prove effects Back Edmund to my brother
I must change arms at home and give the distaff
Shall pass between us Ere long you are like to hear
Spare speech
Decline your head This kiss if it durst speak
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air
Conceive and fare thee well
Edm Yours in the ranks of death                        Exit
Gon My most dear Gloucester
O the difference of man and man
My fool usurps my body
Osw Madam here comes my lord                          Exit
Enter Albany
Gon I have been worth the whistle
Alb O Goneril
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
Blows in your face I fear your disposition
That nature which contemns it origin
Cannot be bordered certain in itself
She that herself will sliver and disbranch
From her material sap perforce must wither
And come to deadly use
Gon No more The text is foolish
Alb Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile
Filths savour but themselves What have you done
A father and a gracious aged man
Most barbarous most degenerate have you madded
Could my good brother suffer you to do it
A man a prince by him so benefited
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences
It will come
Humanity must perforce prey on itself
Like monsters of the deep
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land
With plumed helm thy state begins to threat
Alb See thyself devil
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
So horrid as in woman
Gon O vain fool
To let these hands obey my blood
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
Gon Marry your manhood mew
Enter a Gentleman
Alb What news
Slain by his servant going to put out
The other eye of Gloucester
But not without that harmful stroke which since
Alb This shows you are above
You justicers that these our nether crimes
So speedily can venge But O poor Gloucester
Lose he his other eye
Gent Both both my lord
This letter madam craves a speedy answer
But being widow and my Gloucester with her
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life Another way
Exit
Alb Where was his son when they did take his eyes
Gent Come with my lady hither
Alb He is not here
Gent No my good lord I met him back again
Alb Knows he the wickedness
And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
Might have the freer course
Alb Gloucester I live
And to revenge thine eyes Come hither friend
Exeunt
Scene III
The French camp near Dover
Enter Kent and a Gentleman
Kent Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
reason
Gent Something he left imperfect in the state which since his
coming forth is thought of which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger that his personal return was most required and
necessary
Kent Who hath he left behind him general
Gent The Marshal of France Monsieur La Far
Kent Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
grief
Gent Ay sir She took them read them in my presence
Gent Not to a rage Patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once her smiles and tears
Were like a better way Those happy smilets
What guests were in her eyes which parted thence
If all could so become it
Kent Made she no verbal question
The holy water from her heavenly eyes
To deal with grief alone
Kent It is the stars
The stars above us govern our conditions
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues You spoke not with her since
Gent No
Gent No since
Who sometime in his better tune remembers
What we are come about and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter
Gent Why good sir
Kent A sovereign shame so elbows him his own unkindness
To foreign casualties gave her dear rights
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia
Gent Alack poor gentleman
And leave you to attend him Some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile
When I am known aright you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance I pray you go
Along with me                                      Exeunt
Scene IV
The French camp
Enter with Drum and Colours Cordelia Doctor and Soldiers
Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn A century send forth
wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense
He that helps him take all my outward worth
Doct There is means madam
Our foster nurse of nature is repose
The which he lacks That to provoke in him
Are many simples operative whose power
Will close the eye of anguish
Cor All blest secrets
Spring with my tears be aidant and remediate
That wants the means to lead it
Enter Messenger
Mess News madam
In expectation of them O dear father
It is thy business that I go about
Therefore great France
My mourning and important tears hath pitied
No blown ambition doth our arms incite
Soon may I hear and see him
Exeunt
Scene V
Osw Ay madam
Reg Himself in person there
Osw Madam with much ado
Your sister is the better soldier
Reg Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home
Osw No madam
Osw I know not lady
Reg Faith he is posted hence on serious matter
To let him live Where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us Edmund I think is gone
In pity of his misery to dispatch
His nighted life moreover to descry
Osw I must needs after him madam with my letter
The ways are dangerous
Osw I may not madam
Reg Why should she write to Edmund Might not you
Transport her purposes by word Belike
Let me unseal the letter
Reg I know your lady does not love her husband
I am sure of that and at her late being here
She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund I know you are of her bosom
Osw I madam
Therefore I do advise you take this note
And more convenient is he for my hand
If you do find him pray you give him this
And when your mistress hears thus much from you
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her
So farewell
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off
Osw Would I could meet him madam I should show
What party I do follow
Reg Fare thee well                                   Exeunt
Scene VI
The country near Dover
Edg You do climb up it now Look how we labour
Glou Methinks the ground is even
Edg Horrible steep
Hark do you hear the sea
Glou No truly
Edg Why then your other senses grow imperfect
Glou So may it be indeed
In better phrase and matter than thou didst
But in my garments
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
Show scarce so gross as beetles Halfway down
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head
The fishermen that walk upon the beach
Appear like mice and yond tall anchoring bark
Almost too small for sight The murmuring surge
Lest my brain turn and the deficient sight
Topple down headlong
Glou Set me where you stand
Edg Give me your hand You are now within a foot
Would I not leap upright
Glou Let go my hand
Here friend is another purse in it a jewel
Prosper it with thee Go thou further off
Bid me farewell and let me hear thee going
Edg Now fare ye well good sir
Glou With all my heart
Is done to cure it
Glou O you mighty gods                            He kneels
This world I do renounce and in your sights
Shake patiently my great affliction off
If I could bear it longer and not fall
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills
My snuff and loathed part of nature should
Burn itself out If Edgar live O bless him
Now fellow fare thee well
And yet I know not how conceit may rob
The treasury of life when life itself
Yields to the theft Had he been where he thought
Thus might he pass indeed Yet he revives
What are you sir
Glou Away and let me die
Edg Hadst thou been aught but gossamer feathers air
So many fadom down precipitating
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell
Thy life is a miracle Speak yet again
Edg From the dread summit of this chalky bourn
Cannot be seen or heard Do but look up
Glou Alack I have no eyes
And frustrate his proud will
Edg Give me your arm
Glou Too well too well
Edg This is above all strangeness
Which parted from you
Glou A poor unfortunate beggar
Edg As I stood here below methought his eyes
Were two full moons he had a thousand noses
It was some fiend Therefore thou happy father
Think that the clearest gods who make them honours
Affliction till it do cry out itself
Edg Bear free and patient thoughts
But who comes here
His master thus
Lear No they cannot touch me for coming
I am the King himself
Edg Sweet marjoram
Lear Pass
Glou I know that voice
and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would
Glou The trick of that voice I do well remember
Lear Ay every inch a king
When I do stare see how the subject quakes
Adultery
Thou shalt not die Die for adultery No
Does lecher in my sight
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Whose face between her forks presageth snow
That minces virtue and does shake the head
With a more riotous appetite
Down from the waist they are Centaurs
Though women all above
But to the girdle do the gods inherit
burning scalding stench consumption Fie fie fie pah pah
Give me an ounce of civet good apothecary to sweeten my
Glou O let me kiss that hand
Lear Let me wipe it first it smells of mortality
Shall so wear out to naught Dost thou know me
Lear I remember thine eyes well enough Dost thou squiny at me
challenge mark but the penning of it
Glou Were all the letters suns I could not see one
And my heart breaks at it
Lear Read
Glou What with the case of eyes
Lear O ho are you there with me No eyes in your head nor no
money in your purse Your eyes are in a heavy case your purse
in a light Yet you see how this world goes
Glou I see it feelingly
Lear What art mad A man may see how the world goes with no eyes
Look with thine ears See how yond justice rails upon yond
which is the justice which is the thief Thou hast seen a
Glou Ay sir
Lear And the creature run from the cur There thou mightst behold
Thou rascal beadle hold thy bloody hand
Why dost thou lash that whore Strip thine own back
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks
Take that of me my friend who have the power
And like a scurvy politician seem
To see the things thou dost not Now now now now
Pull off my boots Harder harder So
Reason in madness
Lear If thou wilt weep my fortunes take my eyes
I know thee well enough thy name is Gloucester
Thou must be patient We came crying hither
We wawl and cry I will preach to thee Mark
Glou Alack alack the day
Lear When we are born we cry that we are come
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
Then kill kill kill kill kill kill
Lear No rescue What a prisoner I am even
The natural fool of fortune Use me well
You shall have ransom Let me have a surgeon
Gent You shall have anything
Lear No seconds All myself
Why this would make a man a man of salt
To use his eyes for garden waterpots
Lear I will die bravely like a smug bridegroom What
I will be jovial Come come I am a king
My masters know you that
Gent You are a royal one and we obey you
by running Sa sa sa sa

Past speaking of in a king Thou hast one daughter

Am pregnant to good pity Give me your hand
Glou Hearty thanks

To Edmund Earl of Gloucester Seek him out
Upon the British party O untimely death Death

As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
As badness would desire

Their papers is more lawful             Reads the letter

return the conqueror Then am I the prisoner and his bed my
jail from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me and supply the
place for your labour
And the exchange my brother Here in the sands
Of murtherous lechers and in the mature time
With this ungracious paper strike the sight
That of thy death and business I can tell
Glou The King is mad How stiff is my vile sense
That I stand up and have ingenious feeling
Of my huge sorrows Better I were distract
And woes by wrong imaginations lose
The knowledge of themselves
A drum afar off
Edg Give me your hand
Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum

A tent in the French camp
Enter Cordelia Kent Doctor and Gentleman
Cor O thou good Kent how shall I live and work
To match thy goodness My life will be too short
And every measure fail me
All my reports go with the modest truth
Cor Be better suited

Though he had bit me should have stood that night
Against my fire and wast thou fain poor father
To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn

Sir this I hear the King is come to his daughter
With others whom the rigour of our state
I never yet was valiant For this business
It toucheth us as France invades our land
Not bolds the King with others whom I fear
Most just and heavy causes make oppose
Edm Sir you speak nobly
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here
Edm I shall attend you presently at your tent
Gon No
Hear me one word
Edg Before you fight the battle ope this letter
If you have victory let the trumpet sound
For him that brought it Wretched though I seem
I can produce a champion that will prove
What is avouched there If you miscarry
Your business of the world hath so an end
And machination ceases Fortune love you
Alb Stay till I have read the letter
Edg I was forbid it
When time shall serve let but the herald cry
Enter Edmund
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
By diligent discovery but your haste
Alb We will greet the time                             Exit
Edm To both these sisters have I sworn my love
Each jealous of the other as the stung
Are of the adder Which of them shall I take
If both remain alive To take the widow
Exasperates makes mad her sister Goneril
And hardly shall I carry out my side
His countenance for the battle which being done
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off As for the mercy
The battle done and they within our power
Shall never see his pardon for my state
Stands on me to defend not to debate                Exit

Scene III
The British camp near Dover
Enter in conquest with Drum and Colours Edmund Lear and Cordelia
as prisoners Soldiers Captain
Edm Some officers take them away Good guard
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them
Cor We are not the first
For thee oppressed king am I cast down
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters
And pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh
At gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues
Edm Take them away
Lear Upon such sacrifices my Cordelia
The gods themselves throw incense Have I caught thee
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes Wipe thine eyes
Edm Come hither Captain hark
As this instructs thee thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes Know thou this that men
Does not become a sword Thy great employment
Or thrive by other means
As I have set it down
Capt I cannot draw a cart nor eat dried oats
Flourish Enter Albany Goneril Regan Soldiers
And fortune led you well You have the captives
We do require them of you so to use them
As we shall find their merits and our safety
May equally determine
Edm Sir I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable King
To some retention and appointed guard
Whose age has charms in it whose title more
To pluck the common bosom on his side
Which do command them With him I sent the Queen
My reason all the same and they are ready
Where you shall hold your session At this time
We sweat and bleed the friend hath lost his friend
By those that feel their sharpness
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place
Alb Sir by your patience
I hold you but a subject of this war
Not as a brother
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far He led our powers
Bore the commission of my place and person
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother
Gon Not so hot
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition
Reg In my rights
By me invested he compeers the best
Gon That were the most if he should husband you
Reg Jesters do oft prove prophets
Gon Holla holla
Reg Lady I am not well else I should answer
Take thou my soldiers prisoners patrimony
Dispose of them of me the walls are thine
Witness the world that I create thee here
My lord and master
Gon Mean you to enjoy him
Edm Nor in thine lord
Alb Stay yet hear reason Edmund I arrest thee
On capital treason and in thine attaint
sister
I bar it in the interest of my wife
And I her husband contradict your banes
If you will marry make your loves to me
My lady is bespoke
Gon An interlude
If none appear to prove upon thy person
Thy heinous manifest and many treasons
heart
Ere I taste bread thou art in nothing less
Reg Sick O sick

Call by thy trumpet He that dares approach
On him on you who not I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly
Alb A herald ho
Edm A herald ho a herald
Alb Trust to thy single virtue for thy soldiers
All levied in my name have in my name
Took their discharge
Reg My sickness grows upon me
Alb She is not well Convey her to my tent
Enter a Herald
Come hither herald Let the trumpet sound
And read out this
Capt Sound trumpet                        A trumpet sounds
the army will maintain upon Edmund supposed Earl of Gloucester
that he is a manifold traitor let him appear by the third sound
Edm Sound                                     First trumpet
Her Again                                    Second trumpet
Her Again                                     Third trumpet
Trumpet answers within
Enter Edgar armed at the third sound a Trumpet before him
Alb Ask him his purposes why he appears
Her What are you
Your name your quality and why you answer
This present summons
Edg Know my name is lost
Yet am I noble as the adversary
I come to cope
Alb Which is that adversary
Edg Draw thy sword
That if my speech offend a noble heart
Thy arm may do thee justice Here is mine
Behold it is the privilege of mine honours
Maugre thy strength youth place and eminence
False to thy gods thy brother and thy father
To the descent and dust beneath thy foot
This sword this arm and my best spirits are bent
To prove upon thy heart whereto I speak
Thou liest
Edm In wisdom I should ask thy name
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood I disdain and spurn
Back do I toss those treasons to thy head
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for ever Trumpets speak
Alb Save him save him
Gon This is mere practice Gloucester
Alb Shut your mouth dame
No tearing lady I perceive you know it
Alb Most monstrous
Gon Ask me not what I know                             Exit
And more much more The time will bring it out
I do forgive thee
I am no less in blood than thou art Edmund
The gods are just and of our pleasant vices
Make instruments to scourge us
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
Cost him his eyes
The wheel is come full circle I am here
Alb Methought thy very gait did prophesy
A royal nobleness I must embrace thee
Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
Did hate thee or thy father
Alb Where have you hid yourself
How have you known the miseries of your father
Edg By nursing them my lord List a brief tale
The bloody proclamation to escape
That with the pain of death would hourly die
Met I my father with his bleeding rings
Their precious stones new lost became his guide
Not sure though hoping of this good success
Burst smilingly
And shall perchance do good but speak you on
You look as you had something more to say
Alb If there be more more woful hold it in
For I am almost ready to dissolve
Hearing of this
To such as love not sorrow but another
To amplify too much would make much more
And top extremity
Whilst I was big in clamour came there a man
Who having seen me in my worst estate
He fastened on my neck and bellowed out
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
Began to crack Twice then the trumpets sounded
Alb But who was this
Followed his enemy king and did him service
Improper for a slave
Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife
Gent Help help O help
Edg What kind of help
Alb Speak man
Edg What means that bloody knife
Alb Who dead Speak man
Gent Your lady sir your lady and her sister
Edm I was contracted to them both All three
Now marry in an instant
Enter Kent
Edg Here comes Kent
Alb Produce their bodies be they alive or dead
This judgement of the heavens that makes us tremble
Touches us not with pity O is this he
The time will not allow the compliment
That very manners urges
Kent I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night
Is he not here
Alb Great thing of us forgot
The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in
Seest thou this object Kent
Kent Alack why thus
The one the other poisoned for my sake
And after slew herself
Alb Even so Cover their faces
Edm I pant for life Some good I mean to do
Despite of mine own nature Quickly send
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia
Nay send in time
Alb Run run O run
Edg To who my lord Who has the office Send
Thy token of reprieve
Edm Well thought on Take my sword
Give it the Captain
Edm He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison and
To lay the blame upon her own despair
That she fordid herself
Alb The gods defend her Bear him hence awhile
Lear Howl howl howl howl O you are men of stone
I know when one is dead and when one lives
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone
Why then she lives
Edg Or image of that horror
Alb Fall and cease
Lear This feather stirs she lives If it be so
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt
Kent O my good master
Lear Prithee away
Lear A plague upon you murderers traitors all
Cordelia Cordelia stay a little Ha
Lear Did I not fellow
I have seen the day with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip I am old now
And these same crosses spoil me Who are you
One of them we behold
Your servant Kent Where is your servant Caius
Kent That from your first of difference and decay
Have followed your sad steps
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves
And desperately are dead
Lear Ay so I think
Alb He knows not what he says and vain is it
That we present us to him
Edg Very bootless
Enter a Captain
Capt Edmund is dead my lord
You lords and noble friends know our intent
What comfort to this great decay may come
Shall be applied For us we will resign
During the life of this old Majesty
rights
With boot and Such addition as your honours
The wages of their virtue and all foes
Why should a dog a horse a rat have life
Never never never never never
Pray you undo this button Thank you sir
Do you see this Look on her look her lips
Look there look there                            He dies
Edg He faints My lord my lord
Kent Break heart I prithee break
Edg Look up my lord
Kent Vex not his ghost O let him pass He hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer
Edg He is gone indeed
Alb Bear them from hence Our present business
twain
Kent I have a journey sir shortly to go
My master calls me I must not say no
Alb The weight of this sad time we must obey
Speak what we feel not what we ought to say
The oldest have borne most we that are young
Shall never see so much nor live so long
Exeunt with a dead march

SCENE
Navarre
ACT I SCENE I
Enter the King BEROWNE LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
KING Let fame that all hunt after in their lives
And then grace us in the disgrace of death
When spite of cormorant devouring Time
And make us heirs of all eternity
That war against your own affections
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world
Our court shall be a little Academe
Still and contemplative in living art
You three Berowne Dumain and Longaville
That are recorded in this schedule here
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein
Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too
The mind shall banquet though the body pine
Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits
DUMAIN My loving lord Dumain is mortified
To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die
With all these living in philosophy
BEROWNE I can but say their protestation over
So much dear liege I have already sworn
That is to live and study here three years
But there are other strict observances
As not to see a woman in that term
Which I hope well is not enrolled there
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside
The which I hope is not enrolled there
And then to sleep but three hours in the night
When I was wont to think no harm all night
Which I hope well is not enrolled there
O these are barren tasks too hard to keep
Not to see ladies study fast not sleep
BEROWNE Let me say no my liege an if you please
I only swore to study with your Grace
LONGAVILLE You swore to that Berowne and to the rest
BEROWNE By yea and nay sir then I swore in jest
What is the end of study let me know
KING Why that to know which else we should not know
BEROWNE Come on then I will swear to study so
To know the thing I am forbid to know
As thus to study where I well may dine
When I to feast expressly am forbid
Or study where to meet some mistress fine
When mistresses from common sense are hid
Study to break it and not break my troth
Study knows that which yet it doth not know
KING These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight
BEROWNE Why all delights are vain but that most vain
As painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile
So ere you find where light in darkness lies
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye
Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by
Small have continual plodders ever won
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are
Too much to know is to know nought but fame
And every godfather can give a name
DUMAIN Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding
LONGAVILLE He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding
DUMAIN How follows that
BEROWNE Fit in his place and time
DUMAIN In reason nothing
BEROWNE Something then in rhyme
LONGAVILLE Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost
BEROWNE Well say I am why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing
Why should I joy in any abortive birth
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
But like of each thing that in season grows
So you to study now it is too late
KING Well sit out go home Berowne adieu
BEROWNE No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say
Give me the paper let me read the same
KING How well this yielding rescues thee from shame
LONGAVILLE Four days ago
LONGAVILLE Marry that did I
BEROWNE Sweet lord and why
LONGAVILLE To fright them hence with that dread penalty
BEROWNE A dangerous law against gentility
the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the
This article my liege yourself must break
For well you know here comes in embassy
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit sick and bedrid father
Therefore this article is made in vain
KING What say you lords Why this was quite forgot
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most
KING We must of force dispense with this decree
She must lie here on mere necessity
BEROWNE Necessity will make us all forsworn
For every man with his affects is born
If I break faith this word shall speak for me
I am forsworn on mere necessity
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame
Suggestions are to other as to me
But I believe although I seem so loath
I am the last that will last keep his oath
But is there no quick recreation granted
KING Ay that there is Our court you know is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain
One who the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony
A man of complements whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny
This child of fancy that Armado hight
For interim to our studies shall relate
How you delight my lords I know not I
But I protest I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy
BEROWNE Armado is a most illustrious wight
LONGAVILLE Costard the swain and he shall be our sport
And so to study three years is but short
Enter DULL a constable with a letter and COSTARD
BEROWNE This fellow What wouldst
farborough but I would see his own person in flesh and blood
BEROWNE This is he
this letter will tell you more
COSTARD Sir the contempts thereof are as touching me
KING A letter from the magnificent Armado
BEROWNE How low soever the matter I hope in God for high words
LONGAVILLE A high hope for a low heaven God grant us patience
BEROWNE To hear or forbear hearing
LONGAVILLE To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to
forbear both
BEROWNE Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb
in the merriness
COSTARD The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta
The manner of it is I was taken with the manner
BEROWNE In what manner
COSTARD In manner and form following sir all those three I was
and taken following her into the park which put together is in
BEROWNE For the following sir
COSTARD As it shall follow in my correction and God defend the
right
KING Will you hear this letter with attention
BEROWNE As we would hear an oracle
COSTARD Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh
COSTARD Not a word of Costard yet
COSTARD It may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling
true but so
KING Peace
COSTARD Be to me and every man that dares not fight
KING No words
did commend the black oppressing humour to the most wholesome
myself to walk The time When About the sixth hour when beasts
most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment
which is called supper So much for the time When Now for the
ground Which which I mean I upon it is ycleped thy park Then
for the place Where where I mean I did encounter that obscene
surveyest or seest But to the place Where It standeth
COSTARD Me
COSTARD Me
COSTARD Still me
COSTARD O me
COSTARD With a wench
duty pricks me on have sent to thee to receive the meed of
bring her to trial Thine in all compliments of devoted and
ever I heard
KING Ay the best for the worst But sirrah what say you to
this
COSTARD Sir I confess the wench
KING Did you hear the proclamation
COSTARD I do confess much of the hearing it but little of the
marking of it
wench
COSTARD I was taken with none sir I was taken with a damsel
KING Well it was proclaimed damsel
COSTARD This was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin
KING It is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin
COSTARD If it were I deny her virginity I was taken with a maid
COSTARD This maid will serve my turn sir
KING Sir I will pronounce your sentence you shall fast a week
with bran and water
COSTARD I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge
KING And Don Armado shall be your keeper
And go we lords to put in practice that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn
Exeunt KING LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn
Sirrah come on
COSTARD I suffer for the truth sir for true it is I was taken
with Jaquenetta and Jaquenetta is a true girl and therefore
welcome the sour cup of prosperity Affliction may one day smile
again and till then sit thee down sorrow
Exeunt
SCENE II
The park
Enter ARMADO and MOTH his page
ARMADO Boy what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows
melancholy
MOTH A great sign sir that he will look sad
MOTH No no O Lord sir no
ARMADO How canst thou part sadness and melancholy my tender
juvenal
MOTH By a familiar demonstration of the working my tough signior
ARMADO Why tough signior Why tough signior
MOTH Why tender juvenal Why tender juvenal
ARMADO I spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days which we may nominate tender
MOTH And I tough signior as an appertinent title to your old
time which we may name tough
ARMADO Pretty and apt
MOTH How mean you sir I pretty and my saying apt or I apt and
my saying pretty
ARMADO Thou pretty because little
MOTH Little pretty because little Wherefore apt
ARMADO And therefore apt because quick
MOTH Speak you this in my praise master
ARMADO In thy condign praise
MOTH I will praise an eel with the same praise
ARMADO that an eel is ingenious
MOTH That an eel is quick
ARMADO I have promised to study three years with the Duke
MOTH You may do it in an hour sir
ARMADO Impossible
MOTH How many is one thrice told
MOTH You are a gentleman and a gamester sir
ARMADO I confess both they are both the varnish of a complete
man
amounts to
ARMADO It doth amount to one more than two
MOTH Which the base vulgar do call three
ARMADO True
MOTH Why sir is this such a piece of study Now here is three
dancing horse will tell you
ARMADO A most fine figure
ARMADO I will hereupon confess I am in love And as it is base for
a soldier to love so am I in love with a base wench If drawing
my sword against the humour of affection would deliver me from
the reprobate thought of it I would take Desire prisoner and
me boy what great men have been in love
MOTH Hercules master
ARMADO Most sweet Hercules More authority dear boy name more
and sweet my child let them be men of good repute and carriage
MOTH Samson master he was a man of good carriage great
carriage for he carried the town gates on his back like a
porter and he was in love
in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates I am in
MOTH A woman master
ARMADO Of what complexion
MOTH Of all the four or the three or the two or one of the
four
ARMADO Tell me precisely of what complexion
ARMADO Is that one of the four complexions
MOTH As I have read sir and the best of them too
ARMADO Green indeed is the colour of lovers but to have a love
of that colour methinks Samson had small reason for it He
surely affected her for her wit
MOTH It was so sir for she had a green wit
ARMADO My love is most immaculate white and red
colours
ARMADO Sweet invocation of a child most pretty and pathetical
MOTH      If she be made of white and red
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown
Then if she fear or be to blame
By this you shall not know
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe
A dangerous rhyme master against the reason of white and red
ARMADO Is there not a ballad boy of the King and the Beggar
MOTH The world was very guilty of such a ballad some three ages
would neither serve for the writing nor the tune
example my digression by some mighty precedent Boy I do love
that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind
Costard she deserves well
ARMADO Sing boy my spirit grows heavy in love
ARMADO I say sing
MOTH Forbear till this company be past
Enter DULL COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
must fast three days a week For this damsel I must keep her at
ARMADO I do betray myself with blushing Maid
JAQUENETTA Man
ARMADO I will visit thee at the lodge
ARMADO I know where it is situate
JAQUENETTA Lord how wise you are
ARMADO I will tell thee wonders
JAQUENETTA With that face
ARMADO I love thee
JAQUENETTA So I heard you say
ARMADO And so farewell
JAQUENETTA Fair weather after you
DULL Come Jaquenetta away             Exit with JAQUENETTA
ARMADO Villain thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou be
pardoned
COSTARD Well sir I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full
stomach
ARMADO Thou shalt be heavily punished
COSTARD I am more bound to you than your fellows for they are but
lightly rewarded
ARMADO Take away this villain shut him up
MOTH Come you transgressing slave away
COSTARD Let me not be pent up sir I will fast being loose
MOTH No sir that were fast and loose Thou shalt to prison
COSTARD Well if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I
have seen some shall see
MOTH What shall some see
COSTARD Nay nothing Master Moth but what they look upon It is
not for prisoners to be too silent in their words and therefore
I will say nothing I thank God I have as little patience as
another man and therefore I can be quiet
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
ARMADO I do affect the very ground which is base where her shoe
which is baser guided by her foot which is basest doth tread
love And how can that be true love which is falsely attempted
Love is a familiar Love is a devil There is no evil angel but
Love Yet was Samson so tempted and he had an excellent
strength yet was Solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit
will not serve my turn the passado he respects not the duello
he regards not his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory
is to subdue men Adieu valour rust rapier be still drum
for your manager is in love yea he loveth Assist me some
extemporal god of rhyme for I am sure I shall turn sonnet
Devise wit write pen for I am for whole volumes in folio

ACT II SCENE II
The park
Enter the PRINCESS OF FRANCE with three attending ladies
ROSALINE MARIA KATHARINE BOYET and two other LORDS
BOYET Now madam summon up your dearest spirits
Consider who the King your father sends
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe
Matchless Navarre the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine a dowry for a queen
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Good Lord Boyet my beauty though but mean
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise
Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine
But now to task the tasker good Boyet
Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow
Till painful study shall outwear three years
No woman may approach his silent court
Before we enter his forbidden gates
To know his pleasure and in that behalf
Bold of your worthiness we single you
Tell him the daughter of the King of France
On serious business craving quick dispatch
Importunes personal conference with his Grace
Haste signify so much while we attend
BOYET Proud of employment willingly I go
PRINCESS OF FRANCE All pride is willing pride and yours is so
Exit BOYET
Who are the votaries my loving lords
FIRST LORD Lord Longaville is one
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Know you the man
MARIA I know him madam at a marriage feast
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge solemnized
In Normandy saw I this Longaville
Well fitted in arts glorious in arms
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well
Whose edge hath power to cut whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power
MARIA They say so most that most his humours know
Who are the rest
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved
Most power to do most harm least knowing ill
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good
And shape to win grace though he had no wit
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness
ROSALINE Another of these students at that time
Was there with him if I have heard a truth
Berowne they call him but a merrier man
Within the limit of becoming mirth
His eye begets occasion for his wit
For every object that the one doth catch
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished
So sweet and voluble is his discourse
PRINCESS OF FRANCE God bless my ladies Are they all in love
That every one her own hath garnished
With such bedecking ornaments of praise
FIRST LORD Here comes Boyet
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Now what admittance lord
BOYET Navarre had notice of your fair approach
And he and his competitors in oath
Before I came Marry thus much I have learnt
He rather means to lodge you in the field
Like one that comes here to besiege his court
Than seek a dispensation for his oath
To let you enter his unpeopled house
Enter KING LONGAVILLE DUMAIN BEROWNE
and ATTENDANTS
Here comes Navarre
KING Fair Princess welcome to the court of Navarre
have not yet The roof of this court is too high to be yours and
welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine
KING You shall be welcome madam to my court
PRINCESS OF FRANCE I will be welcome then conduct me thither
KING Not for the world fair madam by my will
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Why will shall break it will and nothing
else
KING Your ladyship is ignorant what it is
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Were my lord so his ignorance were wise
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance
And sin to break it
But pardon me I am too sudden bold
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming
KING Madam I will if suddenly I may
PRINCESS OF FRANCE YOU Will the sooner that I were away
BEROWNE Did not I dance with you in Brabant once
KATHARINE Did not I dance with you in Brabant once
BEROWNE I know you did
KATHARINE How needless was it then to ask the question
BEROWNE You must not be so quick
KATHARINE Not till it leave the rider in the mire
KATHARINE The hour that fools should ask
BEROWNE Now fair befall your mask
KATHARINE Fair fall the face it covers
BEROWNE And send you many lovers
KATHARINE Amen so you be none
BEROWNE Nay then will I be gone
KING Madam your father here doth intimate
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns
Being but the one half of an entire sum
Disbursed by my father in his wars
But say that he or we as neither have
A hundred thousand more in surety of the which
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us
If then the King your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied
We will give up our right in Aquitaine
And hold fair friendship with his Majesty
But that it seems he little purposeth
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns and not demands
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns
To have his title live in Aquitaine
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is
Dear Princess were not his requests so far
And go well satisfied to France again
PRINCESS OF FRANCE You do the King my father too much wrong
And wrong the reputation of your name
In so unseeming to confess receipt
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid
KING I do protest I never heard of it
Or yield up Aquitaine
PRINCESS OF FRANCE We arrest your word
Boyet you can produce acquittances
For such a sum from special officers
Of Charles his father
KING Satisfy me so
BOYET So please your Grace the packet is not come
Where that and other specialties are bound
KING It shall suffice me at which interview
All liberal reason I will yield unto
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
As honour without breach of honour may
Make tender of to thy true worthiness
You may not come fair Princess within my gates
Though so denied fair harbour in my house
Your own good thoughts excuse me and farewell
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Sweet health and fair desires consort your
Grace
KING Thy own wish wish I thee in every place
Exit with attendants
BEROWNE Lady I will commend you to mine own heart
ROSALINE Pray you do my commendations
I would be glad to see it
BEROWNE I would you heard it groan
ROSALINE Is the fool sick
BEROWNE Sick at the heart
ROSALINE Alack let it blood
BEROWNE Would that do it good
ROSALINE No point with my knife
BEROWNE Now God save thy life
ROSALINE And yours from long living
DUMAIN Sir I pray you a word what lady is that same
BOYET The heir of Alencon Katharine her name
DUMAIN A gallant lady Monsieur fare you well          Exit
LONGAVILLE I beseech you a word what is she in the white
BOYET A woman sometimes an you saw her in the light
LONGAVILLE Perchance light in the light I desire her name
BOYET She hath but one for herself to desire that were a shame
LONGAVILLE Pray you sir whose daughter
BOYET Good sir be not offended
She is an heir of Falconbridge
LONGAVILLE Nay my choler is ended
She is a most sweet lady
BOYET Not unlike sir that may be           Exit LONGAVILLE
BOYET Rosaline by good hap
BEROWNE Is she wedded or no
BOYET To her will sir or so
BEROWNE You are welcome sir adieu
BOYET Farewell to me sir and welcome to you
Exit BEROWNE LADIES Unmask
Not a word with him but a jest
BOYET And every jest but a word
PRINCESS OF FRANCE It was well done of you to take him at his
word
BOYET I was as willing to grapple as he was to board
KATHARINE Two hot sheeps marry
BOYET And wherefore not ships
No sheep sweet lamb unless we feed on your lips
KATHARINE Not so gentle beast
My lips are no common though several they be
BOYET Belonging to whom
KATHARINE To my fortunes and me
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Good wits will be jangling but gentles
agree
This civil war of wits were much better used
BOYET If my observation which very seldom lies
Deceive me not now Navarre is infected
PRINCESS OF FRANCE With what
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Your reason
BOYET Why all his behaviours did make their retire
To the court of his eye peeping thorough desire
His heart like an agate with your print impressed
Proud with his form in his eye pride expressed
His tongue all impatient to speak and not see
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be
All senses to that sense did make their repair
To feel only looking on fairest of fair
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss
I only have made a mouth of his eye
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie
ROSALINE Then was Venus like her mother for her father is but
grim
BOYET Do you hear my mad wenches
MARIA No
BOYET What then do you see
MARIA Ay our way to be gone
BOYET You are too hard for me                         Exeunt

ARMADO How meanest thou Brawling in French

eyelids sigh a note and sing a note sometime through the
throat as if you swallowed love with singing love sometime

MOTH Minime honest master or rather master no

MOTH You are too swift sir to say so
ARMADO Sweet smoke of rhetoric
I shoot thee at the swain
MOTH Thump then and I flee                            Exit
ARMADO A most acute juvenal volable and free of grace
By thy favour sweet welkin I must sigh in thy face
Most rude melancholy valour gives thee place
salve sir but a plantain
ARMADO By virtue thou enforcest laughter thy silly thought my
spleen the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous
smiling O pardon me my stars Doth the inconsiderate take
ARMADO No page it is an epilogue or discourse to make plain
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain

Were still at odds being but three
MOTH    Until the goose came out of door
Were still at odds being but three
ARMADO  Until the goose came out of door
Staying the odds by adding four
Sir your pennyworth is good an your goose be fat
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose
ARMADO Come hither come hither How did this argument begin
MOTH By saying that a costard was broken in a shin
COSTARD True and I for a plantain Thus came your argument in
And he ended the market
ARMADO But tell me how was there a costard broken in a shin
MOTH I will tell you sensibly
COSTARD Thou hast no feeling of it Moth I will speak that
I Costard running out that was safely within
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin
ARMADO We will talk no more of this matter
COSTARD Till there be more matter in the shin
ARMADO Sirrah Costard I will enfranchise thee

ARMADO By my sweet soul I mean setting thee at liberty
enfreedoming thy person thou wert immured restrained

COSTARD True true and now you will be my purgation and let me
loose
ARMADO I give thee thy liberty set thee from durance and in
lieu thereof impose on thee nothing but this bear this

MOTH Like the sequel I Signior Costard adieu

Enter BEROWNE
BEROWNE My good knave Costard exceedingly well met
COSTARD Pray you sir how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for
a remuneration
BEROWNE What is a remuneration
COSTARD Marry sir halfpenny farthing
BEROWNE Stay slave I must employ thee
As thou wilt win my favour good my knave
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat
COSTARD When would you have it done sir

BEROWNE Thou knowest not what it is
COSTARD I shall know sir when I have done it
BEROWNE Why villain thou must know first
BEROWNE It must be done this afternoon
Hark slave it is but this
The Princess comes to hunt here in the park
And in her train there is a gentle lady
When tongues speak sweetly then they name her name
And Rosaline they call her Ask for her
And to her white hand see thou do commend
COSTARD Gardon O sweet gardon better than remuneration a
A very beadle to a humorous sigh
Than whom no mortal so magnificent
This wimpled whining purblind wayward boy
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents
Dread prince of plackets king of codpieces
Sole imperator and great general
Of trotting paritors O my little heart
And I to be a corporal of his field
A woman that is like a German clock
And never going aright being a watch
And among three to love the worst of all
A whitely wanton with a velvet brow
With two pitch balls stuck in her face for eyes
Ay and by heaven one that will do the deed
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard
And I to sigh for her to watch for her
To pray for her Go to it is a plague
That Cupid will impose for my neglect
Of his almighty dreadful little might
Well I will love write sigh pray sue and groan
Some men must love my lady and some Joan              Exit

ACT IV SCENE I
The park
Enter the PRINCESS ROSALINE MARIA KATHARINE BOYET LORDS ATTENDANTS
and a FORESTER
hard
Against the steep uprising of the hill
BOYET I know not but I think it was not he
On Saturday we will return to France
Then forester my friend where is the bush
That we must stand and play the murderer in
FORESTER Hereby upon the edge of yonder coppice
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot
PRINCESS OF FRANCE I thank my beauty I am fair that shoot
FORESTER Pardon me madam for I meant not so
PRINCESS OF FRANCE What what First praise me and again say no
FORESTER Yes madam fair
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Nay never paint me now
Where fair is not praise cannot mend the brow
Here good my glass take this for telling true
Fair payment for foul words is more than due
FORESTER Nothing but fair is that which you inherit
O heresy in fair fit for these days
A giving hand though foul shall have fair praise
But come the bow Now mercy goes to kill
And shooting well is then accounted ill
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot
If wounding then it was to show my skill
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill
And out of question so it is sometimes
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes
We bend to that the working of the heart
As I for praise alone now seek to spill
Only for praise sake when they strive to be
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Only for praise and praise we may afford
To any lady that subdues a lord
Enter COSTARD
BOYET Here comes a member of the commonwealth
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Thou shalt know her fellow by the rest that
have no heads
COSTARD Which is the greatest lady the highest
PRINCESS OF FRANCE The thickest and the tallest
COSTARD The thickest and the tallest It is so truth is truth
An your waist mistress were as slender as my wit
Are not you the chief woman You are the thickest here
COSTARD I have a letter from Monsieur Berowne to one
Lady Rosaline
of mine
Stand aside good bearer Boyet you can carve
Break up this capon
BOYET I am bound to serve
This letter is mistook it importeth none here
It is writ to Jaquenetta
PRINCESS OF FRANCE We will read it I swear
Break the neck of the wax and every one give ear
true that thou art beauteous truth itself that thou art lovely
More fairer than fair beautiful than beauteous truer than truth
itself have commiseration on thy heroical vassal The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the
pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon and he it was that
stands the comparison thou the beggar for so witnesseth thy
lowliness Shall I command thy love I may Shall I enforce thy
love I could Shall I entreat thy love I will What shalt thou
eyes on thy picture and my heart on thy every part
Thine in the dearest design of industry
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
Submissive fall his princely feet before
And he from forage will incline to play
But if thou strive poor soul what are thou then
PRINCESS OF FRANCE What plume of feathers is he that indited this
letter
What vane What weathercock Did you ever hear better
BOYET I am much deceived but I remember the style
erewhile
BOYET This Armado is a Spaniard that keeps here in court
A phantasime a Monarcho and one that makes sport
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Thou fellow a word
Who gave thee this letter
COSTARD I told you my lord
PRINCESS OF FRANCE To whom shouldst thou give it
COSTARD From my lord to my lady
PRINCESS OF FRANCE From which lord to which lady
COSTARD From my Lord Berowne a good master of mine
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Thou hast mistaken his letter Come lords
away
day                             Exeunt PRINCESS and TRAIN
BOYET Who is the shooter who is the shooter
ROSALINE Shall I teach you to know
BOYET Ay my continent of beauty
ROSALINE Why she that bears the bow
Finely put off
BOYET My lady goes to kill horns but if thou marry
Hang me by the neck if horns that year miscarry
Finely put on
ROSALINE Well then I am the shooter
BOYET And who is your deer
ROSALINE If we choose by the horns yourself come not near
Finely put on indeed
MARIA You Still wrangle with her Boyet and she strikes at the
brow
BOYET But she herself is hit lower Have I hit her now
ROSALINE Shall I come upon thee with an old saying that was a man
when King Pepin of France was a little boy as touching the hit
BOYET So I may answer thee with one as old that was a woman when
Queen Guinever of Britain was a little wench as touching the hit
Thou canst not hit it hit it hit it
Thou canst not hit it my good man
BOYET    An I cannot cannot cannot
An I cannot another can
Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE
COSTARD By my troth most pleasant How both did fit it
MARIA A mark marvellous well shot for they both did hit it
BOYET A mark O mark but that mark A mark says my lady
clout
BOYET An if my hand be out then belike your hand is in
COSTARD Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin
MARIA Come come you talk greasily your lips grow foul
bowl
Exeunt BOYET and MARIA
COSTARD By my soul a swain a most simple clown
Lord Lord how the ladies and I have put him down
When it comes so smoothly off so obscenely as it were so fit
To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan
Ah heavens it is a most pathetical nit
Sola sola                                     Exit COSTARD
SCENE II
The park
From the shooting within enter HOLOFERNES SIR NATHANIEL and DULL
NATHANIEL Very reverent sport truly and done in the testimony of
a good conscience
HOLOFERNES The deer was as you know sanguis in blood ripe as
the pomewater who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of caelo
the sky the welkin the heaven and anon falleth like a crab on
the face of terra the soil the land the earth
NATHANIEL Truly Master Holofernes the epithets are sweetly
varied like a scholar at the least but sir I assure ye it was
a buck of the first head
HOLOFERNES Sir Nathaniel haud credo
HOLOFERNES Most barbarous intimation yet a kind of insinuation
as it were in via in way of explication facere as it were
replication or rather ostentare to show as it were his
inclination after his undressed unpolished uneducated
unpruned untrained or rather unlettered or ratherest
unconfirmed fashion to insert again my haud credo for a deer
O thou monster Ignorance how deformed dost thou look
NATHANIEL Sir he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in
a book
He hath not eat paper as it were he hath not drunk ink his
intellect is not replenished he is only an animal only sensible
in the duller parts
And such barren plants are set before us that we thankful should
fructify in us more than he
For as it would ill become me to be vain indiscreet or a fool
So were there a patch set on learning to see him in a school
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind
yet
HOLOFERNES Dictynna goodman Dull Dictynna goodman Dull
DULL What is Dictynna
NATHANIEL A title to Phoebe to Luna to the moon
HOLOFERNES The moon was a month old when Adam was no more
the exchange
DULL And I say the polusion holds in the exchange for the moon is
HOLOFERNES Sir Nathaniel will you hear an extemporal epitaph on
the death of the deer And to humour the ignorant call the deer
NATHANIEL Perge good Master Holofernes perge so it shall please
you to abrogate scurrility
HOLOFERNES I Will something affect the letter for it argues
facility
pricket
Some say a sore but not a sore till now made sore with shooting
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L
NATHANIEL A rare talent
talent
HOLOFERNES This is a gift that I have simple simple a foolish
extravagant spirit full of forms figures shapes objects
ideas apprehensions motions revolutions These are begot in
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion But the gift is good in
those in whom it is acute and I am thankful for it
NATHANIEL Sir I praise the Lord for you and so may my
daughters profit very greatly under you You are a good member of
the commonwealth
HOLOFERNES Mehercle if their sons be ingenious they shall want
no instruction if their daughters be capable I will put it to
them but vir sapit qui pauca loquitur A soul feminine saluteth
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA God give you good morrow Master Person
COSTARD Marry Master Schoolmaster he that is likest to a
hogshead

JAQUENETTA Good Master Parson be so good as read me this letter

beseech you read it
HOLOFERNES Fauste precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra

the traveller doth of Venice
Venetia Venetia
Chi non ti vede non ti pretia
Old Mantuan old Mantuan Who understandeth thee not
Ut re sol la mi fa
Under pardon sir what are the contents or rather as
NATHANIEL Ay sir and very learned
HOLOFERNES Let me hear a staff a stanze a verse lege domine
love
Ah never faith could hold if not to beauty vowed
Those thoughts to me were oaks to thee like osiers bowed
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend
If knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire
Which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
Celestial as thou art O pardon love this wrong
HOLOFERNES You find not the apostrophas and so miss the accent
let me supervise the canzonet Here are only numbers ratified
but for the elegancy facility and golden cadence of poesy
smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy the jerks of
invention Imitari is nothing so doth the hound his master the
ape his keeper the tired horse his rider But damosella virgin
was this directed to you
JAQUENETTA Ay sir from one Monsieur Berowne one of the strange
the intellect of the letter for the nomination of the party
of the votaries with the King and here he hath framed a letter
the way of progression hath miscarried Trip and go my sweet
deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King it may
concern much Stay not thy compliment I forgive thy duty Adieu
JAQUENETTA Good Costard go with me Sir God save your life
COSTARD Have with thee my girl
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
NATHANIEL Sir you have done this in the fear of God very
HOLOFERNES Sir tell not me of the father I do fear colourable
colours But to return to the verses did they please you Sir
Nathaniel
NATHANIEL Marvellous well for the pen
mine where if before repast it shall please you to gratify
the table with a grace I will on my privilege I have with the
parents of the foresaid child or pupil undertake your ben
venuto where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned
neither savouring of poetry wit nor invention I beseech your
society
NATHANIEL And thank you too for society saith the text is the
happiness of life
HOLOFERNES And certes the text most infallibly concludes it
pauca verba Away the gentles are at their game and we will to
our recreation                                       Exeunt
SCENE III
The park
Enter BEROWNE with a paper his band alone
BEROWNE The King he is hunting the deer I am coursing myself
so they say the fool said and so say I and I am the fool Well
proved wit By the Lord this love is as mad as Ajax it kills
for her two eyes Well I do nothing in the world but lie and
lie in my throat By heaven I do love and it hath taught me to
rhyme and to be melancholy and here is part of my rhyme and
clown bore it the fool sent it and the lady hath it sweet
clown sweeter fool sweetest lady By the world I would not
care a pin if the other three were in Here comes one with a
paper God give him grace to groan
Enter the KING with a paper
KING Ay me
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
Through the transparent bosom of the deep
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe
Do but behold the tears that swell in me
And they thy glory through my grief will show
But do not love thyself then thou wilt keep
My tears for glasses and still make me weep
O queen of queens how far dost thou excel
Sweet leaves shade folly Who is he comes here
Enter LONGAVILLE with a paper
What Longaville and reading Listen car
BEROWNE Now in thy likeness one more fool appear
LONGAVILLE Ay me I am forsworn
BEROWNE Why he comes in like a perjure wearing papers
KING In love I hope sweet fellowship in shame
BEROWNE One drunkard loves another of the name
BEROWNE I could put thee in comfort not by two that I know
LONGAVILLE I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move
O sweet Maria empress of my love
These numbers will I tear and write in prose
Disfigure not his slop
Persuade my heart to this false perjury
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
A woman I forswore but I will prove
Thou being a goddess I forswore not thee
My vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
Vows are but breath and breath a vapour is
Then thou fair sun which on my earth dost shine
If broken then it is no fault of mine
If by me broke what fool is not so wise
Enter DUMAIN with a paper
Like a demigod here sit I in the sky
More sacks to the mill O heavens I have my wish
Dumain transformed Four woodcocks in a dish
DUMAIN O most divine Kate
BEROWNE O most profane coxcomb
DUMAIN By heaven the wonder in a mortal eye
BEROWNE By earth she is not corporal there you lie
DUMAIN Her amber hairs for foul hath amber quoted
DUMAIN As upright as the cedar
BEROWNE Stoop I say
Her shoulder is with child
DUMAIN As fair as day
BEROWNE Ay as some days but then no sun must shine
DUMAIN O that I had my wish
LONGAVILLE And I had mine
KING And I mine toogood Lord
BEROWNE Amen so I had mine Is not that a good word
DUMAIN I would forget her but a fever she
BEROWNE A fever in your blood Why then incision
Would let her out in saucers Sweet misprision
Love whose month is ever May
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air
Through the velvet leaves the wind
All unseen can passage find
That the lover sick to death
Air would I might triumph so
But alack my hand is sworn
Vow alack for youth unmeet
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet
Do not call it sin in me
That I am forsworn for thee
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were
And deny himself for Jove
This will I send and something else more plain
O would the King Berowne and Longaville
Were lovers too Ill to example ill
For none offend where all alike do dote
You may look pale but I should blush I know
You chide at him offending twice as much
You do not love Maria Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
Saw sighs reek from you noted well your passion
What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
Faith infringed which such zeal did swear
How will he scorn how will he spend his wit
How will he triumph leap and laugh at it
For all the wealth that ever I did see
I would not have him know so much by me
Ah good my liege I pray thee pardon me
Good heart what grace hast thou thus to reprove
These worms for loving that art most in love
Your eyes do make no coaches in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears
Tush none but minstrels like of sonneting
But are you not ashamed Nay are you not
You found his mote the King your mote did see
But I a beam do find in each of three
Of sighs of groans of sorrow and of teen
O me with what strict patience have I sat
To see a king transformed to a gnat
To see great Hercules whipping a gig
And profound Solomon to tune a jig
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys
Where lies thy grief O tell me good Dumain
And gentle Longaville where lies thy pain
A caudle ho
KING Too bitter is thy jest
BEROWNE Not you by me but I betrayed to you
I that am honest I that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in
I am betrayed by keeping company
With men like you men of inconstancy
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme
In pruning me When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand a foot a face an eye
A gait a state a brow a breast a waist
KING Soft whither away so fast
A true man or a thief that gallops so
BEROWNE I post from love good lover let me go
Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD
JAQUENETTA God bless the King
KING What present hast thou there
COSTARD Some certain treason
KING What makes treason here
COSTARD Nay it makes nothing sir
KING If it mar nothing neither
The treason and you go in peace away together
JAQUENETTA I beseech your Grace let this letter be read
Where hadst thou it
JAQUENETTA Of Costard
KING Where hadst thou it
COSTARD Of Dun Adramadio Dun Adramadio
KING How now What is in you Why dost thou tear it
BEROWNE A toy my liege a toy Your Grace needs not fear it
to do me shame
Guilty my lord guilty I confess I confess
KING What
O dismiss this audience and I shall tell you more
DUMAIN Now the number is even
BEROWNE True true we are four
Will these turtles be gone
KING Hence sirs away
COSTARD Walk aside the true folk and let the traitors stay
Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA
BEROWNE Sweet lords sweet lovers O let us embrace
As true we are as flesh and blood can be
The sea will ebb and flow heaven show his face
Young blood doth not obey an old decree
We cannot cross the cause why we were born
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn
KING What did these rent lines show some love of thine
That like a rude and savage man of Inde
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow
That is not blinded by her majesty
My love her mistress is a gracious moon
She an attending star scarce seen a light
BEROWNE My eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne
O but for my love day would turn to night
Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek
Where several worthies make one dignity
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek
Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not
She passes praise then praise too short doth blot
Might shake off fifty looking in her eye
KING By heaven thy love is black as ebony
BEROWNE Is ebony like her O wood divine
A wife of such wood were felicity
O who can give an oath Where is a book
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack
If that she learn not of her eye to look
No face is fair that is not full so black
KING O paradox Black is the badge of hell
The hue of dungeons and the school of night
BEROWNE Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light
It mourns that painting and usurping hair
Should ravish doters with a false aspect
And therefore is she born to make black fair
Her favour turns the fashion of the days
For native blood is counted painting now
And therefore red that would avoid dispraise
Paints itself black to imitate her brow
LONGAVILLE And since her time are colliers counted bright
KING And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack
DUMAIN Dark needs no candles now for dark is light
BEROWNE Your mistresses dare never come in rain
KING No devil will fright thee then so much as she
DUMAIN I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear
BEROWNE O if the streets were paved with thine eyes
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread
DUMAIN O vile Then as she goes what upward lies
KING But what of this Are we not all in love
BEROWNE Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn
KING Then leave this chat and good Berowne now prove
Our loving lawful and our faith not torn
DUMAIN Ay marry there some flattery for this evil
LONGAVILLE O some authority how to proceed
Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil
DUMAIN Some salve for perjury
Consider what you first did swear unto
Say can you fast Your stomachs are too young
And abstinence engenders maladies
In that each of you have forsworn his book
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look
For when would you my lord or you or you
They are the ground the books the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
Why universal plodding poisons up
The nimble spirits in the arteries
The sinewy vigour of the traveller
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
And study too the causer of your vow
For where is author in the world
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
And where we are our learning likewise is
With ourselves
Do we not likewise see our learning there
O we have made a vow to study lords
And in that vow we have forsworn our books
For when would you my liege or you or you
In leaden contemplation have found out
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain
And therefore finding barren practisers
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil
Lives not alone immured in the brain
But with the motion of all elements
Courses as swift as thought in every power
And gives to every power a double power
Above their functions and their offices
It adds a precious seeing to the eye
Than are the tender horns of cockled snails
For valour is not Love a Hercules
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides
Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical
And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods
Make heaven drowsy with the harmony
Never durst poet touch a pen to write
O then his lines would ravish savage ears
And plant in tyrants mild humility
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire
They are the books the arts the academes
That show contain and nourish all the world
Else none at all in aught proves excellent
Then fools you were these women to forswear
Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths
It is religion to be thus forsworn
For charity itself fulfils the law
And who can sever love from charity
KING Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field
BEROWNE Advance your standards and upon them lords
In conflict that you get the sun of them
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France
KING And win them too therefore let us devise
Some entertainment for them in their tents
BEROWNE First from the park let us conduct them thither
Then homeward every man attach the hand
Of his fair mistress In the afternoon
We will with some strange pastime solace them
Such as the shortness of the time can shape
For revels dances masks and merry hours
Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers
KING Away away No time shall be omitted
That will betime and may by us be fitted
And justice always whirls in equal measure
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn
If so our copper buys no better treasure            Exeunt

HOLOFERNES Novi hominem tanquam te His humour is lofty his

SCENE II
The park
Enter the PRINCESS MARIA KATHARINE and ROSALINE
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Sweet hearts we shall be rich ere we depart
If fairings come thus plentifully in
Look you what I have from the loving King
ROSALINE Madam came nothing else along with that
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Nothing but this Yes as much love in rhyme
ROSALINE That was the way to make his godhead wax
For he hath been five thousand year a boy
KATHARINE Ay and a shrewd unhappy gallows too
KATHARINE He made her melancholy sad and heavy
And so she died Had she been light like you
Of such a merry nimble stirring spirit
And so may you for a light heart lives long
KATHARINE A light condition in a beauty dark
ROSALINE We need more light to find your meaning out
KATHARINE So do not you for you are a light wench
ROSALINE Indeed I weigh not you and therefore light
But Rosaline you have a favour too
Who sent it and what is it
ROSALINE I would you knew
An if my face were but as fair as yours
My favour were as great be witness this
Nay I have verses too I thank Berowne
I were the fairest goddess on the ground
O he hath drawn my picture in his letter
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Anything like
ROSALINE Much in the letters nothing in the praise
ROSALINE Ware pencils ho Let me not die your debtor
My red dominical my golden letter
KATHARINE A pox of that jest and I beshrew all shrows
PRINCESS OF FRANCE But Katharine what was sent to you from fair
Dumain
KATHARINE Madam this glove
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Did he not send you twain
KATHARINE Yes madam and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover
A huge translation of hypocrisy
MARIA This and these pearl to me sent Longaville
The letter is too long by half a mile
PRINCESS OF FRANCE I think no less Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short
MARIA Ay or I would these hands might never part
PRINCESS OF FRANCE We are wise girls to mock our lovers so
ROSALINE They are worse fools to purchase mocking so
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests
That he should be my fool and I his fate
PRINCESS OF FRANCE None are so surely caught when they are
ROSALINE The blood of youth burns not with such excess
MARIA Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove by wit worth in simplicity
Enter BOYET
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Here comes Boyet and mirth is in his face
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Thy news Boyet
BOYET Prepare madam prepare
Arm wenches arm Encounters mounted are
Muster your wits stand in your own defence
Or hide your heads like cowards and fly hence
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Saint Dennis to Saint Cupid What are they
That charge their breath against us Say scout say
BOYET Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The King and his companions warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by
Their herald is a pretty knavish page
Action and accent did they teach him there
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder
A better speech was never spoke before
Another with his finger and his thumb
With that they all did tumble on the ground
With such a zealous laughter so profound
That in this spleen ridiculous appears
PRINCESS OF FRANCE But what but what come they to visit us
Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess
Their purpose is to parley court and dance
By favours several which they did bestow
And not a man of them shall have the grace
Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear
And then the King will court thee for his dear
Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine
So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline
And change you favours too so shall your loves
ROSALINE Come on then wear the favours most in sight
KATHARINE But in this changing what is your intent
PRINCESS OF FRANCE The effect of my intent is to cross theirs
They do it but in mocking merriment
And mock for mock is only my intent
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
Upon the next occasion that we meet
PRINCESS OF FRANCE No to the death we will not move a foot
And quite divorce his memory from his part
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Therefore I do it and I make no doubt
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own
So shall we stay mocking intended game
Enter BLACKAMOORS music MOTH as Prologue the
KING and his LORDS as maskers in the guise of Russians
MOTH All hail the richest heauties on the earth
BOYET Beauties no richer than rich taffeta
MOTH A holy parcel of the fairest dames
BEROWNE Their eyes villain their eyes
BOYET True out indeed
MOTH Out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe
BEROWNE Once to behold rogue
BOYET They will not answer to that epithet
MOTH They do not mark me and that brings me out
BEROWNE Is this your perfectness Be gone you rogue
Exit MOTH
ROSALINE What would these strangers Know their minds Boyet
That some plain man recount their purposes
Know what they would
BOYET What would you with the Princess
BEROWNE Nothing but peace and gentle visitation
ROSALINE What would they say they
BOYET Nothing but peace and gentle visitation
ROSALINE Why that they have and bid them so be gone
BOYET She says you have it and you may be gone
To tread a measure with her on this grass
To tread a measure with you on this grass
ROSALINE It is not so Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile If they have measured many
And many miles the Princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile
BEROWNE Tell her we measure them by weary steps
BOYET She hears herself
ROSALINE How many weary steps
BEROWNE We number nothing that we spend for you
Our duty is so rich so infinite
That we may do it still without accompt
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face
That we like savages may worship it
ROSALINE My face is but a moon and clouded too
KING Blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do
Vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine
Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne
ROSALINE O vain petitioner beg a greater matter
Thou now requests but moonshine in the water
KING Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change
ROSALINE Play music then Nay you must do it soon
Not yet No dance Thus change I like the moon
KING Will you not dance How come you thus estranged
KING Yet still she is the Moon and I the Man
The music plays vouchsafe some motion to it
ROSALINE Our ears vouchsafe it
KING But your legs should do it
ROSALINE Since you are strangers and come here by chance
KING Why take we hands then
ROSALINE Only to part friends
Curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends
KING More measure of this measure be not nice
ROSALINE We can afford no more at such a price
KING Price you yourselves What buys your company
ROSALINE Your absence only
KING That can never be
Twice to your visor and half once to you
ROSALINE In private then
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Honey and milk and sugar there is three
BEROWNE Nay then two treys an if you grow so nice
Metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Seventh sweet adieu
BEROWNE One word in secret
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Let it not be sweet
BEROWNE Thou grievest my gall
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Gall bitter
DUMAIN Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word
MARIA Name it
Take that for your fair lady
DUMAIN Please it you
KATHARINE What was your vizard made without a tongue
LONGAVILLE I know the reason lady why you ask
KATHARINE O for your reason Quickly sir I long
LONGAVILLE You have a double tongue within your mask
And would afford my speechless vizard half
LONGAVILLE A calf fair lady
KATHARINE No a fair lord calf
Take all and wean it it may prove an ox
LONGAVILLE Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks
Will you give horns chaste lady Do not so
KATHARINE Then die a calf before your horns do grow
LONGAVILLE One word in private with you ere I die
KATHARINE Bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry
BOYET The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen
Above the sense of sense so sensible
Seemeth their conference their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things
ROSALINE Not one word more my maids break off break off
KING Farewell mad wenches you have simple wits
Exeunt KING LORDS and BLACKAMOORS
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Twenty adieus my frozen Muscovits
Are these the breed of wits so wondered at
Or ever but in vizards show their faces
ROSALINE They were all in lamentable cases
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Berowne did swear himself out of all suit
MARIA Dumain was at my service and his sword
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Qualm perhaps
KATHARINE Yes in good faith
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Go sickness as thou art
But will you hear The King is my love sworn
PRINCESS OF FRANCE And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me
KATHARINE And Longaville was for my service born
MARIA Dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree
BOYET Madam and pretty mistresses give ear
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Will they return
BOYET They will they will God knows
And leap for joy though they are lame with blows
Therefore change favours and when they repair
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air
PRINCESS OF FRANCE How blow how blow Speak to be understood
Are angels vailing clouds or roses blown
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Avaunt perplexity What shall we do
If they return in their own shapes to woo
Let us complain to them what fools were here
And wonder what they were and to what end
And their rough carriage so ridiculous
Should be presented at our tent to us
BOYET Ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand
Exeunt PRINCESS ROSALINE KATHARINE and MARIA
in their proper habits
BOYET Gone to her tent Please it your Majesty
Command me any service to her thither
KING That she vouchsafe me audience for one word
BOYET I will and so will she I know my lord          Exit
BEROWNE This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease
And utters it again when God doth please
At wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs
And we that sell by gross the Lord doth know
Have not the grace to grace it with such show
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve
Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve
This is the ape of form Monsieur the Nice
That when he plays at tables chides the dice
In honourable terms nay he can sing
A mean most meanly and in ushering
Mend him who can The ladies call him sweet
The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet
And consciences that will not die in debt
KING A blister on his sweet tongue with my heart
MARIA and KATHARINE
BEROWNE See where it comes Behaviour what wert thou
KING All hail sweet madam and fair time of day
KING Construe my speeches better if you may
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Then wish me better I will give you leave
KING We came to visit you and purpose now
To lead you to our court vouchsafe it then
PRINCESS OF FRANCE This field shall hold me and so hold your vow
KING Rebuke me not for that which you provoke
The virtue of your eye must break my oath
PRINCESS OF FRANCE You nickname virtue vice you should have
spoke
Now by my maiden honour yet as pure
As the unsullied lily I protest
A world of torments though I should endure
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths vowed with integrity
Unseen unvisited much to our shame
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Not so my lord it is not so I swear
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game
A mess of Russians left us but of late
KING How madam Russians
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Ay in truth my lord
Trim gallants full of courtship and of state
ROSALINE Madam speak true It is not so my lord
My lady to the manner of the days
In courtesy gives undeserving praise
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit here they stayed an hour
They did not bless us with one happy word
I dare not call them fools but this I think
When they are thirsty fools would fain have drink
BEROWNE This jest is dry to me Fair gentle sweet
Your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet
By light we lose light your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor
BEROWNE I am a fool and full of poverty
ROSALINE But that you take what doth to you belong
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue
BEROWNE O I am yours and all that I possess
ROSALINE All the fool mine
BEROWNE I cannot give you less
ROSALINE Which of the vizards was it that you wore
BEROWNE Where when what vizard Why demand you this
ROSALINE There then that vizard that superfluous case
DUMAIN Let us confess and turn it to a jest
BEROWNE Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury
Can any face of brass hold longer out
Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit
And I will wish thee never more to dance
Nor never more in Russian habit wait
Nor never come in vizard to my friend
Taffeta phrases silken terms precise
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation
I do forswear them and I here protest
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes
My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw
BEROWNE Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage bear with me I am sick
They are infected in their hearts it lies
They have the plague and caught it of your eyes
These lords are visited you are not free
PRINCESS OF FRANCE No they are free that gave these tokens to us
BEROWNE Our states are forfeit seek not to undo us
ROSALINE It is not so for how can this be true
That you stand forfeit being those that sue
BEROWNE Peace for I will not have to do with you
ROSALINE Nor shall not if I do as I intend
BEROWNE Speak for yourselves my wit is at an end
KING Teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse
PRINCESS OF FRANCE The fairest is confession
KING Madam I was
KING I was fair madam
PRINCESS OF FRANCE When you then were here
KING That more than all the world I did respect her
PRINCESS OF FRANCE When she shall challenge this you will reject
her
KING Upon mine honour no
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Peace peace forbear
Your oath once broke you force not to forswear
KING Despise me when I break this oath of mine
PRINCESS OF FRANCE I will and therefore keep it Rosaline
What did the Russian whisper in your ear
ROSALINE Madam he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight and did value me
Above this world adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me or else die my lover
PRINCESS OF FRANCE God give thee joy of him The noble lord
Most honourably doth uphold his word
KING What mean you madam By my life my troth
I never swore this lady such an oath
ROSALINE By heaven you did and to confirm it plain
You gave me this but take it sir again
KING My faith and this the Princess I did give
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Pardon me sir this jewel did she wear
And Lord Berowne I thank him is my dear
What will you have me or your pearl again
BEROWNE Neither of either I remit both twain
Knowing aforehand of our merriment
To dash it like a Christmas comedy
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
The ladies did change favours and then we
Now to our perjury to add more terror
We are again forsworn in will and error
Forestall our sport to make us thus untrue
And laugh upon the apple of her eye
And stand between her back sir and the fire
Holding a trencher jesting merrily
Die when you will a smock shall be your shroud
Wounds like a leaden sword
BOYET Full merrily
Hath this brave manage this career been run
BEROWNE Lo he is tilting straight Peace I have done
Enter COSTARD
COSTARD O Lord sir they would know

BEROWNE Go bid them prepare
COSTARD We will turn it finely off sir we will take some care
Exit COSTARD
KING Berowne they will shame us let them not approach
KING I say they shall not come
That sport best pleases that doth least know how
Where zeal strives to content and the contents
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth
When great things labouring perish in their birth
BEROWNE A right description of our sport my lord
Enter ARMADO
ARMADO Anointed I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet
breath as will utter a brace of words
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Doth this man serve God
BEROWNE Why ask you
ARMADO That is all one my fair sweet honey monarch for I

guerra I wish you the peace of mind most royal couplement
Exit ARMADO

HOLOFERNES Great Hercules is presented by this imp

HOLOFERNES You have put me out of countenance
BEROWNE False we have given thee faces
BEROWNE An thou wert a lion we would do so
BOYET Therefore as he is an ass let him go
And so adieu sweet Jude Nay why dost thou stay
DUMAIN For the latter end of his name
HOLOFERNES This is not generous not gentle not humble
BOYET A light for Monsieur Judas It grows dark he may stumble
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Alas poor Maccabaeus how hath he been baited
Enter ARMADO for HECTOR

DUMAIN Though my mocks come home by me I will now be merry
KING Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this
BOYET But is this Hector

DUMAIN That mint
LONGAVILLE That columbine
ARMADO Sweet Lord Longaville rein thy tongue
LONGAVILLE I must rather give it the rein for it runs against
Hector

bestow on me the sense of hearing
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Speak brave Hector we are much delighted
COSTARD The party is gone fellow Hector she is gone she is two
months on her way

MARCADE God save you madam
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Welcome Marcade

MARCADE I am sorry madam for the news I bring
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Dead for my life
MARCADE Even so my tale is told
BEROWNE WOrthies away the scene begins to cloud
ARMADO For mine own part I breathe free breath I have seen the
day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and I will
right myself like a soldier                 Exeunt WORTHIES
KING How fares your Majesty
KING Madam not so I do beseech you stay
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Prepare I say I thank you gracious lords
For all your fair endeavours and entreat
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits
Was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue
Excuse me so coming too short of thanks
KING The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
As to rejoice at friends but newly found
PRINCESS OF FRANCE I understand you not my griefs are double
BEROWNE Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief
And by these badges understand the King
For your fair sakes have we neglected time
Hath much deformed us fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents
As love is full of unbefitting strains
All wanton as a child skipping and vain
Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance
Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes
Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults
Suggested us to make Therefore ladies
Our love being yours the error that love makes
Is likewise yours We to ourselves prove false
By being once false for ever to be true
And even that falsehood in itself a sin
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace
Your favours the ambassadors of love
And in our maiden council rated them
At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy
As bombast and as lining to the time
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion like a merriment
LONGAVILLE So did our looks
ROSALINE We did not quote them so
KING Now at the latest minute of the hour
Grant us your loves
PRINCESS OF FRANCE A time methinks too short
Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this
If for my love as there is no such cause
Your oath I will not trust but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage
Remote from all the pleasures of the world
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood
If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love
But that it bear this trial and last love
Then at the expiration of the year
Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts
And by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mournful house
Raining the tears of lamentation
If this thou do deny let our hands part
KING If this or more than this I would deny
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye
Hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast
BEROWNE And what to me my love and what to me
You are attaint with faults and perjury
Therefore if you my favour mean to get
A twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest
But seek the weary beds of people sick
DUMAIN But what to me my love but what to me
A wife
KATHARINE A beard fair health and honesty
With threefold love I wish you all these three
DUMAIN O shall I say I thank you gentle wife
KATHARINE No so my lord a twelvemonth and a day
Come when the King doth to my lady come
KATHARINE Yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again
LONGAVILLE What says Maria
MARIA The liker you few taller are so young
BEROWNE Studies my lady Mistress look on me
Behold the window of my heart mine eye
What humble suit attends thy answer there
Impose some service on me for thy love
ROSALINE Oft have I heard of you my Lord Berowne
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain
And therewithal to win me if you please
Without the which I am not to be won
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches and your task shall be
With all the fierce endeavour of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile
BEROWNE To move wild laughter in the throat of death
It cannot be it is impossible
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools
Of him that hears it never in the tongue
Of him that makes it then if sickly ears
Will hear your idle scorns continue then
And I will have you and that fault withal
But if they will not throw away that spirit
And I shall find you empty of that fault
Right joyful of your reformation
BEROWNE A twelvemonth Well befall what will befall
my leave
KING No madam we will bring you on your way
BEROWNE Our wooing doth not end like an old play
Might well have made our sport a comedy
PRINCESS OF FRANCE Was not that not Hector
DUMAIN The worthy knight of Troy
ARMADO I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave I am a
sweet love three year But most esteemed greatness will you
hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in
praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo It should have followed in the
end of our show
KING Call them forth quickly we will do so
ARMADO Holla approach
Enter All
SPRING
When daisies pied and violets blue
Do paint the meadows with delight
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he
Unpleasing to a married ear
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
When turtles tread and rooks and daws
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then on every tree
Mocks married men for thus sings he
Unpleasing to a married ear
WINTER
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail
Then nightly sings the staring owl
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And birds sit brooding in the snow
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl
Then nightly sings the staring owl
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot
ARMADO The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo
You that way we this way                            Exeunt

A desert place Thunder and lightning
Enter three Witches
FIRST WITCH When shall we three meet again
In thunder lightning or in rain
THIRD WITCH That will be ere the set of sun
FIRST WITCH Where the place
SECOND WITCH Upon the heath
THIRD WITCH There to meet with Macbeth
FIRST WITCH I come Graymalkin
ALL Paddock calls Anon
Fair is foul and foul is fair
Hover through the fog and filthy air                Exeunt
SCENE II
A camp near Forres Alarum within
Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox with Attendants
meeting a bleeding Sergeant
DUNCAN What bloody man is that He can report
As seemeth by his plight of the revolt
The newest state
MALCOLM This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it
SERGEANT Doubtful it stood
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
Worthy to be a rebel for to that
The multiplying villainies of nature
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
And Fortune on his damned quarrel smiling
Which smoked with bloody execution
Till he faced the slave
DUNCAN O valiant cousin Worthy gentleman
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break
Discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage
Began a fresh assault
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo
SERGEANT Yes
As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
If I say sooth I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks
So they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha
But I am faint my gashes cry for help
DUNCAN So well thy words become thee as thy wounds
They smack of honor both Go get him surgeons
Exit Sergeant attended
Who comes here
Enter Ross
MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross
LENNOX What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look
That seems to speak things strange
ROSS God save the King
DUNCAN Whence camest thou worthy Thane
ROSS From Fife great King
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold
Norway himself with terrible numbers
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
The victory fell on us
DUNCAN Great happiness
ROSS That now
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Ten thousand dollars to our general use
DUNCAN No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death
And with his former title greet Macbeth
DUNCAN What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won
Exeunt

FIRST WITCH Where hast thou been sister
SECOND WITCH Killing swine
THIRD WITCH Sister where thou
And like a rat without a tail
THIRD WITCH And I another
FIRST WITCH I myself have all the other
And the very ports they blow
All the quarters that they know
I will drain him dry as hay
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid
He shall live a man forbid
Shall he dwindle peak and pine
Though his bark cannot be lost
Look what I have
SECOND WITCH Show me show me
THIRD WITCH A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come
ALL The weird sisters hand in hand
Posters of the sea and land
Thus do go about about
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again to make up nine
Enter Macbeth and Banquo
MACBETH So foul and fair a day I have not seen
That man may question You seem to understand me
By each at once her choppy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips You should be women
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so
MACBETH Speak if you can What are you
FIRST WITCH All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Glamis
SECOND WITCH All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Cawdor
THIRD WITCH All hail Macbeth that shalt be King hereafter
BANQUO Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
Are ye fantastical or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope
That he seems rapt withal To me you speak not
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not
Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate
FIRST WITCH Hail
SECOND WITCH Hail
THIRD WITCH Hail
FIRST WITCH Lesser than Macbeth and greater
SECOND WITCH Not so happy yet much happier
THIRD WITCH Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
FIRST WITCH Banquo and Macbeth all hail
MACBETH Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman and to be King
Stands not within the prospect of belief
No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you
Witches vanish
BANQUO The earth hath bubbles as the water has
BANQUO Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner
MACBETH Your children shall be kings
BANQUO You shall be King
MACBETH And Thane of Cawdor too Went it not so
Enter Ross and Angus
ROSS The King hath happily received Macbeth
The news of thy success and when he reads
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his Silenced with that
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make
Strange images of death As thick as hail
Came post with post and every one did bear
ANGUS We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks
Only to herald thee into his sight
Not pay thee
ROSS And for an earnest of a greater honor
He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
In which addition hail most worthy Thane
For it is thine
BANQUO What can the devil speak true
MACBETH The Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me
ANGUS Who was the Thane lives yet
But under heavy judgement bears that life
Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined
With those of Norway or did line the rebel
With hidden help and vantage or that with both
Have overthrown him
pains
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
And oftentimes to win us to our harm
The instruments of darkness tell us truths
Cousins a word I pray you
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Cannot be ill cannot be good If ill
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor
If good why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings
My thought whose murther yet is but fantastical
Shakes so my single state of man that function
But what is not
crown me
Without my stir
BANQUO New honors come upon him
Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day
BANQUO Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure
MACBETH Give me your favor my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains
The leaf to read them Let us toward the King
Think upon what hath chanced and at more time
Our free hearts each to other
BANQUO Very gladly
MACBETH Till then enough Come friends             Exeunt
SCENE IV
Forres The palace
Flourish Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox and Attendants
DUNCAN Is execution done on Cawdor Are not
MALCOLM My liege
They are not yet come back But I have spoke
With one that saw him die who did report
A deep repentance Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed
He was a gentleman on whom I built
An absolute trust
Enter Macbeth Banquo Ross and Angus
O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me Thou art so far before
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
To overtake thee Would thou hadst less deserved
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
Might have been mine Only I have left to say
More is thy due than more than all can pay
MACBETH The service and the loyalty lowe
Is to receive our duties and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants
Which do but what they should by doing everything
Safe toward your love and honor
DUNCAN Welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo
That hast no less deserved nor must be known
No less to have done so let me infold thee
And hold thee to my heart
BANQUO There if I grow
The harvest is your own
DUNCAN My plenteous joys
Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes
And you whose places are the nearest know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only
But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
On all deservers From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you
MACBETH The rest is labor which is not used for you
The hearing of my wife with your approach
So humbly take my leave
DUNCAN My worthy Cawdor
For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires
Let not light see my black and deep desires
The eye wink at the hand yet let that be
Which the eye fears when it is done to see          Exit
DUNCAN True worthy Banquo He is full so valiant
And in his commendations I am fed
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
It is a peerless kinsman                  Flourish Exeunt
SCENE V
Enter Lady Macbeth reading a letter
learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than
mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them
further they made themselves air into which they vanished
Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the
thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness
that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart
Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature
To catch the nearest way Thou wouldst be great
Art not without ambition but without
The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
Enter a Messenger
What is your tidings
MESSENGER The King comes here tonight
MESSENGER So please you it is true our Thane is coming
One of my fellows had the speed of him
Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
Than would make up his message
LADY MACBETH Give him tending
He brings great news                        Exit Messenger
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements Come you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood
Stop up the access and passage to remorse
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
And take my milk for gall your murthering ministers
Wherever in your sightless substances
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
Enter Macbeth
Great Glamis Worthy Cawdor
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present and I feel now
The future in the instant
MACBETH My dearest love
Duncan comes here tonight
LADY MACBETH And when goes hence
MACBETH Tomorrow as he purposes
LADY MACBETH O never
Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my Thane is as a book where men
May read strange matters To beguile the time
Look like the time bear welcome in your eye
Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower
Must be provided for and you shall put
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom
MACBETH We will speak further
LADY MACBETH Only look up clear
To alter favor ever is to fear
Leave all the rest to me                            Exeunt
SCENE VI
Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Banquo Lennox Macduff Ross Angus
and Attendants
DUNCAN This castle hath a pleasant seat the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses
BANQUO This guest of summer
Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze
Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
The air is delicate
Enter Lady Macbeth
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble
Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you
And thank us for your trouble
LADY MACBETH All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house For those of old
We rest your hermits
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor but he rides well
And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him
To his home before us Fair and noble hostess
We are your guest tonight
LADY MACBETH Your servants ever
Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt
Still to return your own
DUNCAN Give me your hand
Conduct me to mine host We love him highly
And shall continue our graces towards him
By your leave hostess                              Exeunt
SCENE VII
Enter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service who pass over
the stage  Then enter Macbeth
It were done quickly If the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence and catch
With his surcease success that but this blow
But here upon this bank and shoal of time
We still have judgement here that we but teach
Bloody instructions which being taught return
First as I am his kinsman and his subject
Strong both against the deed then as his host
Who should against his murtherer shut the door
Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
So clear in his great office that his virtues
Upon the sightless couriers of the air
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent but only
And falls on the other
Enter Lady Macbeth
How now what news
LADY MACBETH Know you not he has
MACBETH We will proceed no further in this business
Golden opinions from all sorts of people
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
Not cast aside so soon
LADY MACBETH Was the hope drunk
And wakes it now to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely From this time
Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valor
As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
And live a coward in thine own esteem
MACBETH Prithee peace
I dare do all that may become a man
Who dares do more is none
LADY MACBETH What beast wast then
That made you break this enterprise to me
When you durst do it then you were a man
And to be more than what you were you would
Be so much more the man Nor time nor place
Did then adhere and yet you would make both
They have made themselves and that their fitness now
Does unmake you I have given suck and know
I would while it was smiling in my face
Have done to this
MACBETH If we should fail
LADY MACBETH We fail
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory the warder of the brain
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only When in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan What not put upon
His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males Will it not be received
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
LADY MACBETH Who dares receive it other
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Upon his death
MACBETH I am settled and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
Away and mock the time with fairest show
False face must hide what the false heart doth know
Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
Enter Banquo and Fleance bearing a torch before him
BANQUO How goes the night boy
FLEANCE The moon is down I have not heard the clock
BANQUO And she goes down at twelve
Their candles are all out Take thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose
Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch
Give me my sword
MACBETH A friend
He hath been in unusual pleasure and
Sent forth great largess to your offices
This diamond he greets your wife withal
By the name of most kind hostess and shut up
In measureless content
MACBETH Being unprepared
Our will became the servant to defect
Which else should free have wrought
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
MACBETH I think not of them
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
We would spend it in some words upon that business
If you would grant the time
It shall make honor for you
BANQUO So I lose none
In seeking to augment it but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear
MACBETH Good repose the while
BANQUO Thanks sir the like to you
Exeunt Banquo and Fleance
MACBETH Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed     Exit Servant
Is this a dagger which I see before me
The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fatal vision sensible
To feeling as to sight Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind a false creation
I see thee yet in form as palpable
As this which now I draw
And such an instrument I was to use
Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
It is the bloody business which informs
Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
And take the present horror from the time
Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives
A bell rings
I go and it is done the bell invites me
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell               Exit
SCENE II
The same
Enter Lady Macbeth
LADY MACBETH That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die
LADY MACBETH Alack I am afraid they have awaked
Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready
Enter Macbeth
My husband
MACBETH I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise
LADY MACBETH I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry
Did not you speak
MACBETH When
LADY MACBETH Now
MACBETH As I descended
LADY MACBETH Ay
MACBETH Hark
LADY MACBETH Donalbain
LADY MACBETH A foolish thought to say a sorry sight
That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
Again to sleep
LADY MACBETH There are two lodged together
LADY MACBETH Consider it not so deeply
Stuck in my throat
LADY MACBETH These deeds must not be thought
After these ways so it will make us mad
LADY MACBETH What do you mean
LADY MACBETH Who was it that thus cried Why worthy Thane
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of things Go get some water
And wash this filthy witness from your hand
Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there Go carry them and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood
I am afraid to think what I have done
LADY MACBETH Infirm of purpose
Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead
That fears a painted devil If he do bleed
For it must seem their guilt         Exit Knocking within
MACBETH Whence is that knocking
What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes
Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine
Making the green one red
LADY MACBETH My hands are of your color but I shame
At the south entry Retire we to our chamber
A little water clears us of this deed
How easy is it then Your constancy
Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us
And show us to be watchers Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts
Knocking within
Wake Duncan with thy knocking I would thou couldst
Exeunt
SCENE III
The same
Enter a Porter Knocking within
both the scales against either scale who committed treason
stealing out of a French hose Come in tailor here you may
all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting
porter
Opens the gate
Enter Macduff and Lennox
MACDUFF Was it so late friend ere you went to bed
That you do lie so late
PORTER Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and
drink sir is a great provoker of three things
MACDUFF What three things does drink especially provoke
it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes
away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be an
equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets
him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens
him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion
equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him
MACDUFF I believe drink gave thee the lie last night
him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though
he took up my legs sometime yet I made shift to cast him
MACDUFF Is thy master stirring
Enter Macbeth
Our knocking has awaked him here he comes
LENNOX Good morrow noble sir
MACBETH morrow both
MACDUFF Is the King stirring worthy Thane
MACBETH Not yet
MACDUFF He did command me to call timely on him
MACDUFF I know this is a joyful trouble to you
MACBETH The labor we delight in physics pain
This is the door
LENNOX Goes the King hence today
MACBETH He does he did appoint so
LENNOX The night has been unruly Where we lay
Our chimneys were blown down and as they say
And prophesying with accents terrible
Of dire combustion and confused events
Was feverous and did shake
LENNOX My young remembrance cannot parallel
A fellow to it
MACDUFF O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee
MACDUFF Confusion now hath made his masterpiece
Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope
LENNOX Mean you his Majesty
MACDUFF Approach the chamber and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon Do not bid me speak
See and then speak yourselves
Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox
Awake awake
Ring the alarum bell Murther and treason
Banquo and Donalbain Malcolm awake
And look on death itself Up up and see
As from your graves rise up and walk like sprites
To countenance this horror Ring the bell       Bell rings
Enter Lady Macbeth
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house Speak speak
MACDUFF O gentle lady
Would murther as it fell
Enter Banquo
O Banquo Banquo
LADY MACBETH Woe alas
What in our house
BANQUO Too cruel anywhere
Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself
And say it is not so
MACBETH Had I but died an hour before this chance
I had lived a blessed time for from this instant
All is but toys renown and grace is dead
The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of
Enter Malcolm and Donalbain
DONALBAIN What is amiss
The spring the head the fountain of your blood
MALCOLM O by whom
Their hands and faces were all badged with blood
So were their daggers which unwiped we found
Upon their pillows
Was to be trusted with them
MACBETH O yet I do repent me of my fury
That I did kill them
MACDUFF Wherefore did you so
MACBETH Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious
Loyal and neutral in a moment No man
The expedition of my violent love
Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan
His silver skin laced with his golden blood
That had a heart to love and in that heart
LADY MACBETH Help me hence ho
MACDUFF Look to the lady
That most may claim this argument for ours
our fate
Hid in an auger hole may rush and seize us
Upon the foot of motion
BANQUO Look to the lady
Lady Macbeth is carried out
And when we have our naked frailties hid
That suffer in exposure let us meet
And question this most bloody piece of work
To know it further Fears and scruples shake us
In the great hand of God I stand and thence
Against the undivulged pretense I fight
Of treasonous malice
MACDUFF And so do I
ALL So all
ALL Well contented
Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
DONALBAIN To Ireland I our separated fortune
Shall keep us both the safer Where we are
The nearer bloody
Hath not yet lighted and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse
Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter Ross with an Old Man
OLD MAN Threescore and ten I can remember well
Within the volume of which time I have seen
Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night
Hath trifled former knowings
ROSS Ah good father
And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp
That darkness does the face of earth entomb
When living light should kiss it
A falcon towering in her pride of place
Beauteous and swift the minions of their race
War with mankind
ROSS They did so to the amazement of mine eyes
Enter Macduff
Here comes the good Macduff
How goes the world sir now
MACDUFF Why see you not
MACDUFF Those that Macbeth hath slain
ROSS Alas the day
What good could they pretend
Suspicion of the deed
Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth
MACDUFF He is already named and gone to Scone
To be invested
MACDUFF Carried to Colmekill
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors
And guardian of their bones
ROSS Will you to Scone
ROSS Well I will thither
MACDUFF Well may you see things well done there
Adieu
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new
ROSS Farewell father
That would make good of bad and friends of foes
Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Forres The palace
Enter Banquo
BANQUO Thou hast it now King Cawdor Glamis all
As the weird women promised and I fear
It should not stand in thy posterity
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings If there come truth from them
Why by the verities on thee made good
May they not be my oracles as well
And set me up in hope But hush no more
Sennet sounds Enter Macbeth as King Lady Macbeth
as Queen Lennox Ross Lords Ladies and Attendants
LADY MACBETH If he had been forgotten
It had been as a gap in our great feast
And all thing unbecoming
MACBETH Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir
BANQUO Let your Highness
Command upon me to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
Forever knit
MACBETH Ride you this afternoon
BANQUO Ay my good lord
MACBETH We should have else desired your good advice
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous
BANQUO As far my lord as will fill up the time
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain
MACBETH Fail not our feast
BANQUO My lord I will not
In England and in Ireland not confessing
Their cruel parricide filling their hearers
With strange invention But of that tomorrow
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu
Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you
MACBETH I wish your horses swift and sure of foot
And so I do commend you to their backs
Farewell                                       Exit Banquo
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night to make society
The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself
Till supper time alone While then God be with you
Exeunt all but Macbeth and an Attendant
Sirrah a word with you Attend those men
Our pleasure
ATTENDANT They are my lord without the palace gate
MACBETH Bring them before us                 Exit Attendant
To be thus is nothing
But to be safely thus Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep and in his royalty of nature
And to that dauntless temper of his mind
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
To act in safety There is none but he
Whose being I do fear and under him
My genius is rebuked as it is said
When first they put the name of King upon me
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
Only for them and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
Rather than so come Fate into the list
Now go to the door and stay there till we call
Exit Attendant
Was it not yesterday we spoke together
FIRST MURTHERER It was so please your Highness
MACBETH Well then now
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune which you thought had been
Our innocent self This I made good to you
Who wrought with them and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
FIRST MURTHERER You made it known to us
MACBETH I did so and went further which is now
Our point of second meeting Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
To pray for this good man and for his issue
FIRST MURTHERER We are men my liege
MACBETH Ay in the catalogue ye go for men
As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs
All by the name of dogs The valued file
Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle
The housekeeper the hunter every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed whereby he does receive
Particular addition from the bill
That writes them all alike and so of men
Now if you have a station in the file
And I will put that business in your bosoms
Whose execution takes your enemy off
Grapples you to the heart and love of us
Who wear our health but sickly in his life
Which in his death were perfect
SECOND MURTHERER I am one my liege
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world
FIRST MURTHERER And I another
That I would set my life on any chance
MACBETH Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy
BOTH MURTHERERS True my lord
MACBETH So is he mine and in such bloody distance
That every minute of his being thrusts
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
For certain friends that are both his and mine
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down And thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons
SECOND MURTHERER We shall my lord
Perform what you command us
MACBETH Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves
Fleance his son that keeps him company
Whose absence is no less material to me
Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart
BOTH MURTHERERS We are resolved my lord
Exeunt Murtherers
If it find heaven must find it out tonight           Exit
SCENE II
The palace
Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant
LADY MACBETH Is Banquo gone from court
SERVANT Ay madam but returns again tonight
LADY MACBETH Say to the King I would attend his leisure
For a few words
SERVANT Madam I will                                  Exit
Where our desire is got without content
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy
Enter Macbeth
How now my lord Why do you keep alone
Of sorriest fancies your companions making
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on Things without all remedy
Remains in danger of her former tooth
But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly Better be with the dead
Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave
Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
Can touch him further
LADY MACBETH Come on
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight
MACBETH So shall I love and so I pray be you
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo
Present him eminence both with eye and tongue
Unsafe the while that we
Must lave our honors in these flattering streams
And make our faces vizards to our hearts
Disguising what they are
LADY MACBETH You must leave this
MACBETH O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown
A deed of dreadful note
MACBETH Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill
So prithee go with me                             Exeunt
SCENE III
A park near the palace
Enter three Murtherers
FIRST MURTHERER But who did bid thee join with us
THIRD MURTHERER Macbeth
SECOND MURTHERER He needs not our mistrust since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just
FIRST MURTHERER Then stand with us
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day
Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn and near approaches
The subject of our watch
THIRD MURTHERER Hark I hear horses
That are within the note of expectation
FIRST MURTHERER His horses go about
Make it their walk
SECOND MURTHERER A light a light
Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch
BANQUO It will be rain tonight
FIRST MURTHERER Let it come down
They set upon Banquo
BANQUO O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly
Thou mayst revenge O slave          Dies Fleance escapes
THIRD MURTHERER Who did strike out the light
FIRST MURTHERER Wast not the way
SECOND MURTHERER We have lost
Best half of our affair
Exeunt
SCENE IV
A Hall in the palace A banquet prepared
Enter Macbeth Lady Macbeth Ross Lennox Lords and Attendants
MACBETH You know your own degrees sit down At first
And last the hearty welcome
LORDS Thanks to your Majesty
MACBETH Ourself will mingle with society
And play the humble host
Our hostess keeps her state but in best time
We will require her welcome
LADY MACBETH Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends
For my heart speaks they are welcome
Enter first Murtherer to the door
face
MURTHERER My lord his throat is cut that I did for him
That did the like for Fleance If thou didst it
Thou art the nonpareil
MURTHERER Most royal sir
Whole as the marble founded as the rock
As broad and general as the casing air
MURTHERER Ay my good lord Safe in a ditch he bides
With twenty trenched gashes on his head
The least a death to nature
MACBETH Thanks for that
Hath nature that in time will venom breed
No teeth for the present Get thee gone Tomorrow
Exit Murtherer
LADY MACBETH My royal lord
You do not give the cheer The feast is sold
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony
Meeting were bare without it
MACBETH Sweet remembrancer
Now good digestion wait on appetite
And health on both
Were the graced person of our Banquo present
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance
ROSS His absence sir
To grace us with your royal company
LENNOX Here is a place reserved sir
MACBETH Where
MACBETH Which of you have done this
LORDS What my good lord
MACBETH Thou canst not say I did it never shake
Thy gory locks at me
ROSS Gentlemen rise his Highness is well
LADY MACBETH Sit worthy friends my lord is often thus
And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat
The fit is momentary upon a thought
He will again be well If much you note him
You shall offend him and extend his passion
MACBETH Ay and a bold one that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil
LADY MACBETH O proper stuff
This is the very painting of your fear
Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts
Impostors to true fear would well become
Authorized by her grandam Shame itself
You look but on a stool
MACBETH Prithee see there Behold Look Lo How say you
Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too
If charnel houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites                      Exit Ghost
MACBETH If I stand here I saw him
LADY MACBETH Fie for shame
Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal
Too terrible for the ear The time has been
That when the brains were out the man would die
And there an end but now they rise again
With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns
And push us from our stools This is more strange
Than such a murther is
LADY MACBETH My worthy lord
Your noble friends do lack you
MACBETH I do forget
Do not muse at me my most worthy friends
I have a strange infirmity which is nothing
To those that know me Come love and health to all
And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss
Would he were here To all and him we thirst
And all to all
LORDS Our duties and the pledge
MACBETH Avaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee
Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with
LADY MACBETH Think of this good peers
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time
MACBETH What man dare I dare
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear
Take any shape but that and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble Or be alive again
And dare me to the desert with thy sword
If trembling I inhabit then protest me
The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow
Unreal mockery hence                           Exit Ghost
Why so being gone
I am a man again Pray you sit still
LADY MACBETH You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting
With most admired disorder
MACBETH Can such things be
Without our special wonder You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
ROSS What sights my lord
LADY MACBETH I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse
Question enrages him At once good night
Stand not upon the order of your going
But go at once
LENNOX Good night and better health
Attend his Majesty
LADY MACBETH A kind good night to all
Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth
MACBETH will have blood they say blood will have blood
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak
Augures and understood relations have
By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
LADY MACBETH Almost at odds with morning which is which
At our great bidding
LADY MACBETH Did you send to him sir
MACBETH I hear it by the way but I will send
I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow
And betimes I will to the weird sisters
More shall they speak for now I am bent to know
By the worst means the worst For mine own good
All causes shall give way I am in blood
Strange things I have in head that will to hand
LADY MACBETH You lack the season of all natures sleep
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use
We are yet but young in deed                       Exeunt
SCENE V
A heath Thunder
Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate
FIRST WITCH Why how now Hecate You look angerly
HECATE Have I not reason beldams as you are
Saucy and overbold How did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death
And I the mistress of your charms
The close contriver of all harms
Or show the glory of our art
And which is worse all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son
Spiteful and wrathful who as others do
Loves for his own ends not for you
But make amends now Get you gone
And at the pit of Acheron
Will come to know his destiny
Your vessels and your spells provide
Your charms and everything beside
Unto a dismal and a fatal end
Great business must be wrought ere noon
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vaporous drop profound
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion
He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear
And you all know security
Music and a song within
Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me                Exit
Exeunt
SCENE VI
Forres The palace
Enter Lennox and another Lord
LENNOX My former speeches have but hit your thoughts
Which can interpret farther only I say
Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead
For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
To kill their gracious father Damned fact
How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight
In pious rage the two delinquents tear
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep
Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too
He has borne all things well and I do think
Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell
Where he bestows himself
LORD The son of Duncan
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
Lives in the English court and is received
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
Takes from his high respect Thither Macduff
Is gone to pray the holy King upon his aid
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward
That by the help of these with Him above
To ratify the work we may again
Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives
All which we pine for now And this report
Hath so exasperate the King that he
Prepares for some attempt of war
LENNOX Sent he to Macduff
The cloudy messenger turns me his back
LENNOX And that well might
Advise him to a caution to hold what distance
His wisdom can provide Some holy angel
Fly to the court of England and unfold
His message ere he come that a swift blessing
May soon return to this our suffering country
Under a hand accursed
Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
A cavern In the middle a boiling cauldron Thunder
Enter the three Witches
FIRST WITCH Round about the cauldron go
Toad that under cold stone
ALL Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
SECOND WITCH Fillet of a fenny snake
In the cauldron boil and bake
Eye of newt and toe of frog
Wool of bat and tongue of dog
For a charm of powerful trouble
ALL Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
THIRD WITCH Scale of dragon tooth of wolf
Liver of blaspheming Jew
Gall of goat and slips of yew
Make the gruel thick and slab
For the ingredients of our cawdron
ALL Double double toil and trouble
Fire burn and cauldron bubble
Then the charm is firm and good
Enter Hecate to the other three Witches
HECATE O well done I commend your pains
And now about the cauldron sing
Like elves and fairies in a ring
Enchanting all that you put in
Hecate retires
SECOND WITCH By the pricking of my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes
Open locks
Whoever knocks
Enter Macbeth
MACBETH How now you secret black and midnight hags
ALL A deed without a name
MACBETH I conjure you by that which you profess
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations though the treasure
Even till destruction sicken answer me
To what I ask you
FIRST WITCH Speak
SECOND WITCH Demand
Into the flame
ALL Come high or low
Thyself and office deftly show
Thunder First Apparition an armed Head
FIRST WITCH He knows thy thought
Hear his speech but say thou nought
FIRST APPARITION Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth Beware Macduff
Beware the Thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough
Descends
More potent than the first
Thunder Second Apparition a bloody Child
SECOND APPARITION Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth
SECOND APPARITION Be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn
The power of man for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth                                Descends
MACBETH Then live Macduff What need I fear of thee
And take a bond of fate thou shalt not live
And sleep in spite of thunder
Thunder Third Apparition a Child crowned
with a tree in his hand
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king
And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty
Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are
Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill
Shall come against him                            Descends
MACBETH That will never be
Who can impress the forest bid the tree
Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath
To time and mortal custom Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing tell me if your art
Reign in this kingdom
ALL Seek to know no more
MACBETH I will be satisfied Deny me this
And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know
Why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this
Hautboys
FIRST WITCH Show
SECOND WITCH Show
THIRD WITCH Show
ALL Show his eyes and grieve his heart
Come like shadows so depart
A show of eight Kings the last with a glass in his hand
MACBETH Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs And thy hair
A third is like the former Filthy hags
Why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes
What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom
And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass
Which shows me many more and some I see
That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry
And points at them for his What is this so
FIRST WITCH Ay sir all this is so But why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly
Comesisters cheer we up his sprites
And show the best of our delights
While you perform your antic round
That this great King may kindly say
Our duties did his welcome pay
Music The Witches dance and
then vanish with Hecate
MACBETH are they Gone Let this pernicious hour
Stand ay accursed in the calendar
Come in without there
Enter Lennox
MACBETH Saw you the weird sisters
LENNOX No my lord
MACBETH Came they not by you
LENNOX No indeed my lord
The galloping of horse Who wast came by
Macduff is fled to England
MACBETH Fled to England
LENNOX Ay my good lord
Unless the deed go with it From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand And even now
To crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done
The castle of Macduff I will surprise
His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line No boasting like a fool
Come bring me where they are                       Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross
LADY MACDUFF What had he done to make him fly the land
ROSS You must have patience madam
LADY MACDUFF He had none
His flight was madness When our actions do not
Our fears do make us traitors
ROSS You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear
LADY MACDUFF Wisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes
His mansion and his titles in a place
From whence himself does fly He loves us not
He wants the natural touch for the poor wren
The most diminutive of birds will fight
Her young ones in her nest against the owl
All is the fear and nothing is the love
As little is the wisdom where the flight
So runs against all reason
ROSS My dearest coz
I pray you school yourself But for your husband
He is noble wise Judicious and best knows
But cruel are the times when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor
From what we fear yet know not what we fear
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move I take my leave of you
Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward
To what they were before My pretty cousin
Blessing upon you
ROSS I am so much a fool should I stay longer
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort
I take my leave at once                               Exit
And what will you do now How will you live
SON As birds do Mother
LADY MACDUFF What with worms and flies
SON With what I get I mean and so do they
The pitfall nor the gin
SON Why should I Mother Poor birds they are not set for
My father is not dead for all your saying
LADY MACDUFF Yes he is dead How wilt thou do for father
SON Nay how will you do for a husband
LADY MACDUFF Why I can buy me twenty at any market
With wit enough for thee
SON Was my father a traitor Mother
LADY MACDUFF Ay that he was
SON What is a traitor
LADY MACDUFF Why one that swears and lies
SON And be all traitors that do so
LADY MACDUFF Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be
hanged
SON And must they all be hanged that swear and lie
LADY MACDUFF Everyone
SON Who must hang them
LADY MACDUFF Why the honest men
SON Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and
swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them
LADY MACDUFF Now God help thee poor monkey But how wilt thou do
for a father
were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father
Enter a Messenger
MESSENGER Bless you fair dame I am not to you known
Though in your state of honor I am perfect
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly
Be not found here hence with your little ones
To fright you thus methinks I am too savage
To do worse to you were fell cruelty
Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you
I dare abide no longer                                Exit
LADY MACDUFF Whither should I fly
I have done no harm But I remember now
I am in this earthly world where to do harm
Is often laudable to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly Why then alas
Do I put up that womanly defense
Enter Murtherers
FIRST MURTHERER Where is your husband
LADY MACDUFF I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him
FIRST MURTHERER What you egg
Stabs him
Young fry of treachery
Run away I pray you                                  Dies
Exeunt Murtherers following her
SCENE III
Enter Malcolm and Macduff
MALCOLM Let us seek out some desolate shade and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty
MACDUFF Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
Like syllable of dolor
What know believe and what I can redress
As I shall find the time to friend I will
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
Was once thought honest You have loved him well
You may deserve of him through me and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god
MACDUFF I am not treacherous
MALCOLM But Macbeth is
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose
Angels are bright still though the brightest fell
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace
Yet grace must still look so
MACDUFF I have lost my hopes
MALCOLM Perchance even there where I did find my doubts
Why in that rawness left you wife and child
Those precious motives those strong knots of love
Let not my jealousies be your dishonors
But mine own safeties You may be rightly just
Whatever I shall think
MACDUFF Bleed bleed poor country
Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure
For goodness dare not check thee Wear thou thy wrongs
And the rich East to boot
MALCOLM Be not offended
I speak not as in absolute fear of you
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke
It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands But for all this
Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever
By him that shall succeed
MACDUFF What should he be
MALCOLM It is myself I mean in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb being compared
With my confineless harms
MACDUFF Not in the legions
In evils to top Macbeth
MALCOLM I grant him bloody
Luxurious avaricious false deceitful
Sudden malicious smacking of every sin
In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters
Your matrons and your maids could not fill up
The cestern of my lust and my desire
That did oppose my will Better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign
MACDUFF Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours You may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty
And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink
We have willing dames enough there cannot be
That vulture in you to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves
Finding it so inclined
MALCOLM With this there grows
A stanchless avarice that were I King
I should cut off the nobles for their lands
To make me hunger more that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal
Destroying them for wealth
MACDUFF This avarice
Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root
The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
Of your mere own All these are portable
As justice verity temperance stableness
Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness
Devotion patience courage fortitude
I have no relish of them but abound
In the division of each several crime
Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell
Uproar the universal peace confound
All unity on earth
MACDUFF O Scotland Scotland
MALCOLM If such a one be fit to govern speak
I am as I have spoken
MACDUFF Fit to govern
No not to live O nation miserable
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed
And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet
Died every day she lived Fare thee well
Thy hope ends here
MALCOLM Macduff this noble passion
Child of integrity hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me
Deal between thee and me For even now
I put myself to thy direction and
Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself
For strangers to my nature I am yet
Unknown to woman never was forsworn
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own
At no time broke my faith would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life My first false speaking
Was this upon myself What I am truly
Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men
Already at a point was setting forth
Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent
MACDUFF Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
Enter a Doctor
MALCOLM Well more anon Comes the King forth I pray you
DOCTOR Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls
That stay his cure Their malady convinces
The great assay of art but at his touch
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand
They presently amend
MALCOLM I thank you Doctor                     Exit Doctor
A most miraculous work in this good King
I have seen him do How he solicits heaven
The mere despair of surgery he cures
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction With this strange virtue
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy
And sundry blessings hang about his throne
That speak him full of grace
Enter Ross
MACDUFF See who comes here
MALCOLM My countryman but yet I know him not
MACDUFF My ever gentle cousin welcome hither
MALCOLM I know him now Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers
ROSS Sir amen
MACDUFF Stands Scotland where it did
ROSS Alas poor country
Almost afraid to know itself It cannot
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Expire before the flowers in their caps
Dying or ere they sicken
MACDUFF O relation
Too nice and yet too true
Each minute teems a new one
MACDUFF How does my wife
ROSS Why well
MACDUFF And all my children
ROSS Well too
MACDUFF Be not a niggard of your speech How goest
ROSS When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor
Of many worthy fellows that were out
Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses
We are coming thither Gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out
ROSS Would I could answer
This comfort with the like But I have words
Where hearing should not latch them
MACDUFF What concern they
Due to some single breast
But in it shares some woe though the main part
Pertains to you alone
MACDUFF If it be mine
Keep it not from me quickly let me have it
ROSS Let not your ears despise my tongue forever
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard
MACDUFF Humh I guess at it
ROSS Your castle is surprised your wife and babes
To add the death of you
MALCOLM Merciful heaven
What man Neer pull your hat upon your brows
Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak
MACDUFF My children too
ROSS Wife children servants all
That could be found
MACDUFF And I must be from thence
ROSS I have said
MALCOLM Be comforted
To cure this deadly grief
MACDUFF He has no children All my pretty ones
What all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop
MALCOLM Dispute it like a man
MACDUFF I shall do so
But I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to me Did heaven look on
And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
They were all struck for thee Naught that I am
Not for their own demerits but for mine
Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now
MALCOLM Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief
Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it
MACDUFF O I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
Cut short all intermission front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
Heaven forgive him too
MALCOLM This tune goes manly
Come go we to the King our power is ready
Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking and the powers above
Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may
The night is long that never finds the day          Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Dunsinane Anteroom in the castle
Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman
DOCTOR I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no
truth in your report When was it she last walked
GENTLEWOMAN Since his Majesty went into the field have seen her
rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her
afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while
in a most fast sleep
DOCTOR A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the
benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this slumbery
agitation besides her walking and other actual performances
what at any time have you heard her say
GENTLEWOMAN That sir which I will not report after her
GENTLEWOMAN Neither to you nor anyone having no witness to
confirm my speech
Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper
Lo you here she comes This is her very guise and upon my
life fast asleep Observe her stand close
DOCTOR How came she by that light
GENTLEWOMAN Why it stood by her She has light by her
DOCTOR You see her eyes are open
GENTLEWOMAN Ay but their sense is shut
DOCTOR What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands
GENTLEWOMAN It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus
washing her hands I have known her continue in this a quarter of
an hour
DOCTOR Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her to
satisfy my remembrance the more strongly
afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call our
power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to have
had so much blood in him
DOCTOR Do you mark that
LADY MACBETH The Thane of Fife had a wife where is she now What
DOCTOR Go to go to you have known what you should not
GENTLEWOMAN She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that
Heaven knows what she has known
of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand Oh oh oh
DOCTOR What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged
GENTLEWOMAN I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
dignity of the whole body
GENTLEWOMAN Pray God it be sir
DOCTOR This disease is beyond my practice Yet I have known those
which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their
beds
LADY MACBETH Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so
DOCTOR Even so
To bed to bed to bed
Exit
DOCTOR Will she go now to bed
GENTLEWOMAN Directly
DOCTOR Foul whisperings are abroad Unnatural deeds
Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets
More needs she the divine than the physician
God God forgive us all Look after her
Remove from her the means of all annoyance
And still keep eyes upon her So good night
My mind she has mated and amazed my sight
I think but dare not speak
GENTLEWOMAN Good night good doctor
Exeunt
SCENE II
The country near Dunsinane Drum and colors
Enter Menteith Caithness Angus Lennox and Soldiers
MENTEITH The English power is near led on by Malcolm
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff
Revenges burn in them for their dear causes
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
Excite the mortified man
ANGUS Near Birnam Wood
Shall we well meet them that way are they coming
CAITHNESS Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother
LENNOX For certain sir he is not I have a file
And many unrough youths that even now
Protest their first of manhood
MENTEITH What does the tyrant
CAITHNESS Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies
Do call it valiant fury but for certain
Within the belt of rule
ANGUS Now does he feel
His secret murthers sticking on his hands
Those he commands move only in command
Nothing in love Now does he feel his title
Upon a dwarfish thief
MENTEITH Who then shall blame
When all that is within him does condemn
Itself for being there
CAITHNESS Well march we on
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal
Each drop of us
LENNOX Or so much as it needs
To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds
Make we our march towards Birnam           Exeunt marching
SCENE III
Dunsinane A room in the castle
Enter Macbeth Doctor and Attendants
MACBETH Bring me no more reports let them fly all
Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane
Was he not born of woman The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus
And mingle with the English epicures
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear
Enter a Servant
MACBETH Geese villain
SERVANT Soldiers sir
Death of thy soul Those linen cheeks of thine
SERVANT The English force so please you
MACBETH Take thy face hence                    Exit Servant
Will cheer me ever or disseat me now
I have lived long enough My way of life
And that which should accompany old age
As honor love obedience troops of friends
I must not look to have but in their stead
Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not
Seyton
Enter Seyton
MACBETH What news more
Give me my armor
Send out more horses skirr the country round
Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armor
How does your patient doctor
DOCTOR Not so sick my lord
That keep her from her rest
MACBETH Cure her of that
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Which weighs upon the heart
DOCTOR Therein the patient
Must minister to himself
Come put mine armor on give me my staff
Seyton send out Doctor the Thanes fly from me
Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast
The water of my land find her disease
And purge it to a sound and pristine health
I would applaud thee to the very echo
What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug
Would scour these English hence Hearst thou of them
DOCTOR Ay my good lord your royal preparation
Makes us hear something
MACBETH Bring it after me
I will not be afraid of death and bane
Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane
Profit again should hardly draw me here             Exeunt
SCENE IV
Country near Birnam Wood Drum and colors
Enter Malcolm old Seward and his Son Macduff Menteith Caithness
Angus Lennox Ross and Soldiers marching
MALCOLM Cousins I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe
MENTEITH We doubt it nothing
SIWARD What wood is this before us
MENTEITH The Wood of Birnam
MALCOLM Let every soldier hew him down a bough
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us
SOLDIERS It shall be done
SIWARD We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure
For where there is advantage to be given
Both more and less have given him the revolt
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too
MACDUFF Let our just censures
Attend the true event and put we on
Industrious soldiership
SIWARD The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate
Towards which advance the war
Exeunt Marching
SCENE V
Dunsinane Within the castle
Enter Macbeth Seyton and Soldiers with drum and colors
MACBETH Hang out our banners on the outward walls
Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up
Were they not forced with those that should be ours
We might have met them dareful beard to beard
And beat them backward home
A cry of women within
What is that noise
SEYTON It is the cry of women my good lord            Exit
MACBETH I have almost forgot the taste of fears
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me
Wherefore was that cry
SEYTON The Queen my lord is dead
MACBETH She should have died hereafter
There would have been a time for such a word
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death Out out brief candle
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more It is a tale
Told by an idiot full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing
Enter a Messenger
Thou comest to use thy tongue thy story quickly
MESSENGER Gracious my lord
I should report that which I say I saw
But know not how to do it
MACBETH Well say sir
MESSENGER As I did stand my watch upon the hill
The Wood began to move
MACBETH Liar and slave
Within this three mile may you see it coming
I say a moving grove
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive
Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth
I care not if thou dost for me as much
I pull in resolution and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out
If this which he avouches does appear
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here
Ring the alarum bell Blow wind Come wrack
SCENE VI
Dunsinane  Before the castle
Enter Malcolm old Siward Macduff and their Army with boughs
Drum and colors
MALCOLM Now near enough your leavy screens throw down
And show like those you are You worthy uncle
Shall with my cousin your right noble son
Lead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we
According to our order
SIWARD Fare you well
Let us be beaten if we cannot fight
MACDUFF Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death
Exeunt
SCENE VII
Dunsinane  Before the castle  Alarums
Enter Macbeth
MACBETH They have tied me to a stake I cannot fly
That was not born of woman Such a one
Am I to fear or none
Enter young Siward
YOUNG SIWARD What is thy name
Than any is in hell
YOUNG SIWARD The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear
MACBETH No nor more fearful
YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest abhorred tyrant with my sword
They fight and young Seward is slain
MACBETH Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn
Alarums Enter Macduff
MACDUFF That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face
If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine
I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves Either thou Macbeth
I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be
By this great clatter one of greatest note
Seems bruited Let me find him Fortune
And more I beg not                           Exit Alarums
Enter Malcolm and old Siward
The noble Thanes do bravely in the war
The day almost itself professes yours
And little is to do
MALCOLM We have met with foes
That strike beside us
SIWARD Enter sir the castle
Exeunt Alarum
SCENE VIII
Another part of the field
Enter Macbeth
MACBETH Why should I play the Roman fool and die
On mine own sword Whiles I see lives the gashes
Do better upon them
Enter Macduff
MACDUFF Turn hell hound turn
MACBETH Of all men else I have avoided thee
But get thee back my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already
MACDUFF I have no words
My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out                    They fight
MACBETH Thou losest labor
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests
I bear a charmed life which must not yield
To one of woman born
MACDUFF Despair thy charm
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
MACBETH Accursed be that tongue that tells me so
And be these juggling fiends no more believed
That patter with us in a double sense
That keep the word of promise to our ear
MACDUFF Then yield thee coward
Painted upon a pole and underwrit
MACBETH I will not yield
Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane
And thou opposed being of no woman born
Yet I will try the last Before my body
I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff
Exeunt fighting Alarums
SCENE IX
Retreat Flourish Enter with drum and colors Malcolm old Siward Ross
the other Thanes and Soldiers
MALCOLM I would the friends we miss were safe arrived
SIWARD Some must go off and yet by these I see
So great a day as this is cheaply bought
MALCOLM Macduff is missing and your noble son
He only lived but till he was a man
In the unshrinking station where he fought
But like a man he died
SIWARD Then he is dead
ROSS Ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth for then
It hath no end
SIWARD Had he his hurts before
ROSS Ay on the front
Had I as many sons as I have hairs
I would not wish them to a fairer death
They say he parted well and paid his score
And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort
MACDUFF Hail King for so thou art Behold where stands
That speak my salutation in their minds
Hail King of Scotland
ALL Hail King of Scotland                         Flourish
MALCOLM We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves
And make us even with you My Thanes and kinsmen
Henceforth be Earls the first that ever Scotland
Which would be planted newly with the time
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Took off her life this and what needful else
That calls upon us by the grace of Grace
We will perform in measure time and place
So thanks to all at once and to each one
Flourish Exeunt

SCENE
Vienna
ACT I SCENE I
Enter DUKE ESCALUS LORDS and ATTENDANTS
DUKE Escalus
ESCALUS My lord
DUKE Of government the properties to unfold
Since I am put to know that your own science
Exceeds in that the lists of all advice
My strength can give you then no more remains
And let them work The nature of our people
As art and practice hath enriched any
That we remember There is our commission
From which we would not have you warp Call hither
I say bid come before us Angelo         Exit an ATTENDANT
What figure of us think you he will bear
For you must know we have with special soul
Elected him our absence to supply
And given his deputation all the organs
Of our own power What think you of it
ESCALUS If any in Vienna be of worth
To undergo such ample grace and honour
It is Lord Angelo
Enter ANGELO
DUKE Look where he comes
I come to know your pleasure
DUKE Angelo
There is a kind of character in thy life
Fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings
Are not thine own so proper as to waste
Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do
Not light them for themselves for if our virtues
But to fine issues nor Nature never lends
The smallest scruple of her excellence
But like a thrifty goddess she determines
Herself the glory of a creditor
Both thanks and use But I do bend my speech
To one that can my part in him advertise
In our remove be thou at full ourself
Mortality and mercy in Vienna
Live in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus
Though first in question is thy secondary
Take thy commission
ANGELO Now good my lord
Let there be some more test made of my metal
Before so noble and so great a figure
DUKE No more evasion
Proceeded to you therefore take your honours
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
Matters of needful value We shall write to you
As time and our concernings shall importune
How it goes with us and do look to know
What doth befall you here So fare you well
Of your commissions
ANGELO Yet give leave my lord
That we may bring you something on the way
DUKE My haste may not admit it
Nor need you on mine honour have to do
With any scruple your scope is as mine own
So to enforce or qualify the laws
As to your soul seems good Give me your hand
But do not like to stage me to their eyes
Though it do well I do not relish well
Their loud applause and Aves vehement
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
That does affect it Once more fare you well
ANGELO The heavens give safety to your purposes
ESCALUS Lead forth and bring you back in happiness
DUKE I thank you Fare you well                         Exit
ESCALUS I shall desire you sir to give me leave
To have free speech with you and it concerns me
To look into the bottom of my place
I am not yet instructed
And we may soon our satisfaction have
Touching that point
SCENE II
A street
Enter Lucio and two other GENTLEMEN
LUCIO If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition
with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the
King
FIRST GENTLEMAN Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of
SECOND GENTLEMAN Amen
and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal
meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace
SECOND GENTLEMAN I never heard any soldier dislike it
LUCIO I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was
said
SECOND GENTLEMAN No A dozen times at least
FIRST GENTLEMAN What in metre
LUCIO In any proportion or in any language
FIRST GENTLEMAN I think or in any religion
LUCIO Ay why not Grace is grace despite of all controversy as
for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all
grace
FIRST GENTLEMAN Well there went but a pair of shears between us
LUCIO I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet
Thou art the list
velvet Do I speak feelingly now
LUCIO I think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of
thy speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin
thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after thee
FIRST GENTLEMAN I think I have done myself wrong have I not
SECOND GENTLEMAN Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or
free
Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE
LUCIO Behold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I have
SECOND GENTLEMAN To what I pray
FIRST GENTLEMAN Judge
SECOND GENTLEMAN To three thousand dolours a year
FIRST GENTLEMAN Ay and more
LUCIO A French crown more
FIRST GENTLEMAN Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou
art full of error I am sound
LUCIO Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things
that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast
of thee
FIRST GENTLEMAN How now which of your hips has the most profound
sciatica
to prison was worth five thousand of you all
carried away and which is more within these three days his
LUCIO But after all this fooling I would not have it so Art
thou sure of this
MRS OVERDONE I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam
Julietta with child
SECOND GENTLEMAN Besides you know it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose
FIRST GENTLEMAN But most of all agreeing with the proclamation
Exeunt Lucio and GENTLEMEN
MRS OVERDONE Thus what with the war what with the sweat what
Enter POMPEY
POMPEY Yonder man is carried to prison
MRS OVERDONE Well what has he done
POMPEY A woman
POMPEY Groping for trouts in a peculiar river
MRS OVERDONE What is there a maid with child by him
heard of the proclamation have you
MRS OVERDONE What proclamation man
MRS OVERDONE And what shall become of those in the city
POMPEY They shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that
a wise burgher put in for them
MRS OVERDONE But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
POMPEY To the ground mistress
What shall become of me
POMPEY Come fear not you good counsellors lack no clients
be your tapster still Courage there will be pity taken on you
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will
be considered
POMPEY Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison
Enter PROVOST CLAUDIO JULIET and OFFICERS
LUCIO following
Bear me to prison where I am committed
PROVOST I do it not in evil disposition
But from Lord Angelo by special charge
CLAUDIO Thus can the demigod Authority
Make us pay down for our offence by weight
The words of heaven on whom it will it will
LUCIO Why how now Claudio whence comes this restraint
CLAUDIO From too much liberty my Lucio liberty
As surfeit is the father of much fast
So every scope by the immoderate use
Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane
A thirsty evil and when we drink we die
LUCIO If I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for
certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth I had as lief
have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment
CLAUDIO What but to speak of would offend again
CLAUDIO No
LUCIO Lechery
CLAUDIO Call it so
PROVOST Away sir you must go
CLAUDIO One word good friend Lucio a word with you
after
CLAUDIO Thus stands it with me upon a true contract
You know the lady she is fast my wife
Save that we do the denunciation lack
Of outward order this we came not to
Remaining in the coffer of her friends
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
Till time had made them for us But it chances
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
With character too gross is writ on Juliet
LUCIO With child perhaps
CLAUDIO Unhappily even so
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
Or whether that the body public be
A horse whereon the governor doth ride
Who newly in the seat that it may know
He can command lets it straight feel the spur
Whether the tyranny be in his place
Or in his eminence that fills it up
I stagger in But this new governor
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
And none of them been worn and for a name
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
LUCIO I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy
shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off
Send after the Duke and appeal to him
I prithee Lucio do me this kind service
This day my sister should the cloister enter
And there receive her approbation
Acquaint her with the danger of my state
Implore her in my voice that she make friends
To the strict deputy bid herself assay him
I have great hope in that for in her youth
There is a prone and speechless dialect
Such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
When she will play with reason and discourse
And well she can persuade
LUCIO I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like
which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the
enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus
CLAUDIO I thank you good friend Lucio
LUCIO Within two hours
CLAUDIO Come officer away                           Exeunt
SCENE III
A monastery
Enter DUKE and FRIAR THOMAS
DUKE No holy father throw away that thought
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
Can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee
To give me secret harbour hath a purpose
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
Of burning youth
FRIAR May your Grace speak of it
DUKE My holy sir none better knows than you
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
Where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps
A man of stricture and firm abstinence
My absolute power and place here in Vienna
And so it is received Now pious sir
You will demand of me why I do this
FRIAR Gladly my lord
DUKE We have strict statutes and most biting laws
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip
That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers
For terror not to use in time the rod
Dead to infliction to themselves are dead
And liberty plucks justice by the nose
The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
Goes all decorum
FRIAR It rested in your Grace
Than in Lord Angelo
DUKE I do fear too dreadful
For what I bid them do for we bid this be done
When evil deeds have their permissive pass
And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father
And yet my nature never in the fight
To do in slander And to behold his sway
Visit both prince and people Therefore I prithee
Supply me with the habit and instruct me
How I may formally in person bear me
Like a true friar Moe reasons for this action
At our more leisure shall I render you
Only this one Lord Angelo is precise
Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
That his blood flows or that his appetite
Is more to bread than stone Hence shall we see
If power change purpose what our seemers be         Exeunt
SCENE IV
A nunnery
Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA
ISABELLA And have you nuns no farther privileges
FRANCISCA Are not these large enough
ISABELLA Yes truly I speak not as desiring more
But rather wishing a more strict restraint
Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare
Turn you the key and know his business of him
You may I may not you are yet unsworn
But in the presence of the prioress
Then if you speak you must not show your face
Or if you show your face you must not speak
He calls again I pray you answer him        Exit FRANCISCA
Enter LUCIO
Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me
As bring me to the sight of Isabella
A novice of this place and the fair sister
To her unhappy brother Claudio
The rather for I now must make you know
I am that Isabella and his sister
LUCIO Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you
ISABELLA Woe me For what
LUCIO For that which if myself might be his judge
He should receive his punishment in thanks
He hath got his friend with child
ISABELLA Sir make me not your story
LUCIO It is true
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted
By your renouncement an immortal spirit
As with a saint
ISABELLA You do blaspheme the good in mocking me
As those that feed grow full as blossoming time
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
ISABELLA Some one with child by him My cousin Juliet
LUCIO Is she your cousin
By vain though apt affection
LUCIO She it is
ISABELLA O let him marry her
LUCIO This is the point
The Duke is very strangely gone from hence
Bore many gentlemen myself being one
In hand and hope of action but we do learn
By those that know the very nerves of state
And with full line of his authority
Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood
The wanton stings and motions of the sense
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
With profits of the mind study and fast
Which have for long run by the hideous law
Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it
And follows close the rigour of the statute
To make him an example All hope is gone
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
ISABELLA Doth he so seek his life
Already and as I hear the Provost hath
A warrant for his execution
To do him good
ISABELLA My power alas I doubt
LUCIO Our doubts are traitors
And make us lose the good we oft might win
By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo
And let him learn to know when maidens sue
Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
All their petitions are as freely theirs
As they themselves would owe them
LUCIO But speedily
ISABELLA I will about it straight
No longer staying but to give the Mother
Notice of my affair I humbly thank you
Commend me to my brother soon at night
LUCIO I take my leave of you
ISABELLA Good sir adieu                              Exeunt

ACT II Scene I
Enter ANGELO ESCALUS a JUSTICE PROVOST OFFICERS and other ATTENDANTS
ANGELO We must not make a scarecrow of the law
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey
And let it keep one shape till custom make it
Their perch and not their terror
ESCALUS Ay but yet
Let us be keen and rather cut a little
Than fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman
Whom I would save had a most noble father
Let but your honour know
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue
That in the working of your own affections
Or that the resolute acting of our blood
Whether you had not sometime in your life
Another thing to fall I not deny
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
That justice seizes What knows the laws
Because we see it but what we do not see
We tread upon and never think of it
You may not so extenuate his offence
For I have had such faults but rather tell me
When I that censure him do so offend
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death
And nothing come in partial Sir he must die
ESCALUS Be it as your wisdom will
ANGELO Where is the Provost
PROVOST Here if it like your honour
ANGELO See that Claudio
Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall
Some run from breaks of ice and answer none
And some condemned for a fault alone
Enter ELBOW and OFFICERS with FROTH and POMPEY
ELBOW Come bring them away if these be good people in a
commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses
I know no law bring them away
and my name is Elbow I do lean upon justice sir and do bring
in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors
malefactors
ELBOW If it please your honour I know not well what they are but
precise villains they are that I am sure of and void of all
profanation in the world that good Christians ought to have
ANGELO Go to what quality are they of Elbow is your name Why
dost thou not speak Elbow
ANGELO What are you sir

ELBOW I say sir I will detest myself also as well as she that
for it is a naughty house
ESCALUS How dost thou know that constable
ELBOW Marry sir by my wife who if she had been a woman
adultery and all uncleanliness there
his face so she defied him
POMPEY Sir if it please your honour this is not so
ELBOW Prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man
prove it
ESCALUS Do you hear how he misplaces
POMPEY Sir she came in great with child and longing saving your
house which at that very distant time stood as it were in a
fruit dish a dish of some three pence your honours have seen
such dishes they are not China dishes but very good dishes
ESCALUS Go to go to no matter for the dish sir
POMPEY No indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the
right but to the point As I say this Mistress Elbow being as
said for prunes and having but two in the dish as I said
Master Froth here this very man having eaten the rest as I
said and as I say paying for them very honestly for as you
FROTH No indeed
FROTH Ay so I did indeed
that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you
FROTH All this is true
ESCALUS Come you are a tedious fool To the purpose what was
to what was done to her
POMPEY Sir your honour cannot come to that yet
ESCALUS No sir nor I mean it not
I beseech you look into Master Froth here sir a man of
at Hallowmas Master Froth
POMPEY Why very well I hope here be truths He sir sitting as
where indeed you have a delight to sit have you not
FROTH I have so because it is an open room and good for winter
POMPEY Why very well then I hope here be truths
ANGELO This will last out a night in Russia
And leave you to the hearing of the cause
ESCALUS I think no less Good morrow to your lordship
once more
ELBOW I beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife
POMPEY I beseech your honour ask me
ESCALUS Well sir what did this gentleman to her
your honour mark his face
ESCALUS Ay sir very well
POMPEY Nay I beseech you mark it well
ESCALUS Well I do so
POMPEY Doth your honour see any harm in his face
ESCALUS Why no
about him Good then if his face be the worst thing about him
know that of your honour
ELBOW First an it like you the house is a respected house next
this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected
woman
POMPEY By this hand sir his wife is a more respected person than
any of us all
ELBOW Varlet thou liest thou liest wicket varlet the time is
yet to come that she was ever respected with man woman or
child
POMPEY Sir she was respected with him before he married with her
ESCALUS Which is the wiser here Justice or Iniquity Is this
true
ELBOW O thou caitiff O thou varlet O thou wicked Hannibal I
respected with her before I was married to her If ever I was
respected with her or she with me let not your worship think me
action of slander too
ESCALUS Truly officer because he hath some offences in him that
thou wouldst discover if thou couldst let him continue in his
ELBOW Marry I thank your worship for it Thou seest thou wicked
thou varlet thou art to continue
ESCALUS Where were you born friend

ESCALUS Hath she had any more than one husband
POMPEY Nine sir Overdone by the last
ESCALUS Nine Come hither to me Master Froth Master Froth I
would not have you acquainted with tapsters they will draw you
Master Froth and you will hang them Get you gone and let me
hear no more of you
FROTH I thank your worship For mine own part I never come into
any room in a taphouse but I am drawn in
Tapster
POMPEY Pompey
ESCALUS What else
POMPEY Bum sir
ESCALUS Troth and your bum is the greatest thing about you so
that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the Great Pompey
you are partly a bawd Pompey howsoever you colour it in being a
tapster Are you not Come tell me true it shall be the better
for you
POMPEY Truly sir I am a poor fellow that would live
think of the trade Pompey Is it a lawful trade
POMPEY If the law would allow it sir
ESCALUS But the law will not allow it Pompey nor it shall not be
allowed in Vienna
POMPEY Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of
the city
ESCALUS No Pompey
your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you
need not to fear the bawds
ESCALUS There is pretty orders beginning I can tell you but it
is but heading and hanging
POMPEY If you head and hang all that offend that way but for ten
house in it after threepence a bay If you live to see this come
to pass say Pompey told you so
ESCALUS Thank you good Pompey and in requital of your prophecy
hark you I advise you let me not find you before me again upon
do Pompey I shall beat you to your tent and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you in plain dealing Pompey I shall have you whipt
So for this time Pompey fare you well
shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine
Whip me No no let carman whip his jade
ESCALUS Come hither to me Master Elbow come hither Master
Constable How long have you been in this place of constable
ELBOW Seven year and a half sir
ESCALUS I thought by the readiness in the office you had
continued in it some time You say seven years together
ELBOW And a half sir
ESCALUS Alas it hath been great pains to you They do you wrong
sufficient to serve it
ELBOW Faith sir few of any wit in such matters as they are
chosen they are glad to choose me for them I do it for some
piece of money and go through with all
ESCALUS Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven the
most sufficient of your parish
JUSTICE Eleven sir
ESCALUS I pray you home to dinner with me
JUSTICE I humbly thank you
ESCALUS It grieves me for the death of Claudio
JUSTICE Lord Angelo is severe
ESCALUS It is but needful
Mercy is not itself that oft looks so
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe
But yet poor Claudio There is no remedy
Come sir                                            Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter PROVOST and a SERVANT
His pleasure may be he will relent Alas
He hath but as offended in a dream
All sects all ages smack of this vice and he
Enter ANGELO
ANGELO Did not I tell thee yea Hadst thou not order
Why dost thou ask again
PROVOST Lest I might be too rash
Under your good correction I have seen
When after execution judgment hath
ANGELO Go to let that be mine
Do you your office or give up your place
What shall be done sir with the groaning Juliet
ANGELO Dispose of her
To some more fitter place and that with speed
Desires access to you
ANGELO Hath he a sister
PROVOST Ay my good lord a very virtuous maid
And to be shortly of a sisterhood
If not already
ANGELO Well let her be admitted                Exit SERVANT
Let her have needful but not lavish means
Enter Lucio and ISABELLA
your will
ISABELLA I am a woeful suitor to your honour
Please but your honour hear me
ISABELLA There is a vice that most I do abhor
And most desire should meet the blow of justice
For which I would not plead but that I must
For which I must not plead but that I am
ANGELO Well the matter
I do beseech you let it be his fault
And not my brother
ANGELO Condemn the fault and not the actor of it
Mine were the very cipher of a function
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record
And let go by the actor
ISABELLA O just but severe law
I had a brother then Heaven keep your honour
Kneel down before him hang upon his gown
You are too cold if you should need a pin
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it
To him I say
ISABELLA Must he needs die
ANGELO Maiden no remedy
ISABELLA Yes I do think that you might pardon him
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
ISABELLA But can you if you would
ANGELO Look what I will not that I cannot do
As mine is to him
ISABELLA Too late Why no I that do speak a word
May call it back again Well believe this
No ceremony that to great ones longs
Become them with one half so good a grace
As mercy does
If he had been as you and you as he
Would not have been so stern
ANGELO Pray you be gone
ISABELLA I would to heaven I had your potency
And you were Isabel Should it then be thus
And what a prisoner
ANGELO Your brother is a forfeit of the law
And you but waste your words
ISABELLA Alas Alas
Why all the souls that were were forfeit once
And He that might the vantage best have took
Found out the remedy How would you be
If He which is the top of judgment should
But judge you as you are O think on that
And mercy then will breathe within your lips
Like man new made
ANGELO Be you content fair maid
It is the law not I condemn your brother
Were he my kinsman brother or my son
We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven
With less respect than we do minister
To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you
Who is it that hath died for this offence
ANGELO The law hath not been dead though it hath slept
Takes note of what is done and like a prophet
Are now to have no successive degrees
But here they live to end
ISABELLA Yet show some pity
ANGELO I show it most of all when I show justice
For then I pity those I do not know
And do him right that answering one foul wrong
Lives not to act another Be satisfied
ISABELLA So you must be the first that gives this sentence
And he that suffers O it is excellent
To use it like a giant
ISABELLA Could great men thunder
As Jove himself does Jove would never be quiet
For every pelting petty officer
Would use his heaven for thunder
Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
Than the soft myrtle But man proud man
His glassy essence like an angry ape
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
As makes the angels weep who with our speens
Would all themselves laugh mortal
ISABELLA We cannot weigh our brother with ourself
But in the less foul profanation
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
ANGELO Why do you put these sayings upon me
ISABELLA Because authority though it err like others
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
A natural guiltiness such as is his
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
ISABELLA Gentle my lord turn back
ANGELO How bribe me
ISABELLA Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
ISABELLA Not with fond sicles of the tested gold
Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor
As fancy values them but with true prayers
That shall be up at heaven and enter there
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
To nothing temporal
ISABELLA Heaven keep your honour safe
Am that way going to temptation
Where prayers cross
Shall I attend your lordship
ISABELLA Save your honour              Exeunt all but ANGELO
ANGELO From thee even from thy virtue
The tempter or the tempted who sins most
Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I
That lying by the violet in the sun
Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be
That modesty may more betray our sense
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie
What dost thou or what art thou Angelo
Dost thou desire her foully for those things
That make her good O let her brother live
Thieves for their robbery have authority
When judges steal themselves What do I love her
That I desire to hear her speak again
O cunning enemy that to catch a saint
With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous
Is that temptation that doth goad us on
To sin in loving virtue Never could the strumpet
With all her double vigour art and nature
Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
Subdues me quite Ever till now
SCENE III
A prison
Enter severally DUKE disguised as a FRIAR and PROVOST
DUKE Hail to you Provost so I think you are
DUKE Bound by my charity and my blest order
I come to visit the afflicted spirits
Here in the prison Do me the common right
To let me see them and to make me know
The nature of their crimes that I may minister
To them accordingly
PROVOST I would do more than that if more were needful
Enter JULIET
Look here comes one a gentlewoman of mine
Who falling in the flaws of her own youth
More fit to do another such offence
Than die for this
DUKE When must he die
And you shall be conducted
DUKE Repent you fair one of the sin you carry
JULIET I do and bear the shame most patiently
And try your penitence if it be sound
Or hollowly put on
DUKE So then it seems your most offenceful act
Was mutually committed
JULIET Mutually
DUKE Then was your sin of heavier kind than his
JULIET I do confess it and repent it father
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame
Which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
JULIET I do repent me as it is an evil
And take the shame with joy
DUKE There rest
And I am going with instruction to him
Grace go with you Benedicite                          Exit
That respites me a life whose very comfort
Is still a dying horror
SCENE IV
Enter ANGELO
ANGELO When I would pray and think I think and pray
To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words
Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth
As if I did but only chew his name
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
Of my conception The state whereon I studied
Is like a good thing being often read
Grown sere and tedious yea my gravity
Could I with boot change for an idle plume
Which the air beats for vain O place O form
How often dost thou with thy case thy habit
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood
Enter SERVANT
SERVANT One Isabel a sister desires access to you
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart
Making both it unable for itself
And dispossessing all my other parts
Of necessary fitness
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
Come all to help him and so stop the air
By which he should revive and even so
Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
Crowd to his presence where their untaught love
Must needs appear offence
Enter ISABELLA
How now fair maid
ISABELLA I am come to know your pleasure
ANGELO That you might know it would much better please me
ISABELLA Even so Heaven keep your honour
ANGELO Yet may he live awhile and it may be
As long as you or I yet he must die
ISABELLA Under your sentence
ANGELO Yea
ISABELLA When I beseech you that in his reprieve
Longer or shorter he may be so fitted
That his soul sicken not
ANGELO Ha Fie these filthy vices It were as good
A man already made as to remit
Falsely to take away a life true made
As to put metal in restrained means
To make a false one
ANGELO Say you so Then I shall pose you quickly
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
ISABELLA Sir believe this
I had rather give my body than my soul
Stand more for number than for accompt
ISABELLA How say you
Against the thing I say Answer to this
I now the voice of the recorded law
Might there not be a charity in sin
It is no sin at all but charity
Were equal poise of sin and charity
ISABELLA That I do beg his life if it be sin
Heaven let me bear it You granting of my suit
To have it added to the faults of mine
And nothing of your answer
ANGELO Nay but hear me
Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant
ISABELLA Let me be ignorant and in nothing good
But graciously to know I am no better
ANGELO Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
When it doth tax itself as these black masks
Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder
Your brother is to die
ISABELLA So
ANGELO And his offence is so as it appears
Accountant to the law upon that pain
ISABELLA True
ANGELO Admit no other way to save his life
As I subscribe not that nor any other
But in the loss of question that you his sister
Whose credit with the judge or own great place
Could fetch your brother from the manacles
No earthly mean to save him but that either
You must lay down the treasures of your body
What would you do
ISABELLA As much for my poor brother as myself
That is were I under the terms of death
And strip myself to death as to a bed
My body up to shame
ANGELO Then must your brother die
Better it were a brother died at once
Than that a sister by redeeming him
Should die for ever
ANGELO Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
ISABELLA Ignominy in ransom and free pardon
Are of two houses lawful mercy
Is nothing kin to foul redemption
A merriment than a vice
ISABELLA O pardon me my lord It oft falls out
To have what we would have we speak not what we mean
I something do excuse the thing I hate
For his advantage that I dearly love
ANGELO We are all frail
ISABELLA Else let my brother die
If not a fedary but only he
Owe and succeed thy weakness
ANGELO Nay women are frail too
ISABELLA Ay as the glasses where they view themselves
Which are as easy broke as they make forms
Women help heaven Men their creation mar
In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail
For we are soft as our complexions are
And credulous to false prints
ANGELO I think it well
And from this testimony of your own sex
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
Than faults may shake our frames let me be bold
I do arrest your words Be that you are
By all external warrants show it now
ISABELLA I have no tongue but one gentle my lord
Let me intreat you speak the former language
ANGELO Plainly conceive I love you
ISABELLA My brother did love Juliet
ANGELO He shall not Isabel if you give me love
Which seems a little fouler than it is
To pluck on others
ANGELO Believe me on mine honour
My words express my purpose
And most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming
Sign me a present pardon for my brother
What man thou art
ANGELO Who will believe thee Isabel
Will so your accusation overweigh
That you shall stifle in your own report
And smell of calumny I have begun
And now I give my sensual race the rein
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
By yielding up thy body to my will
Or else he must not only die the death
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
Or by the affection that now guides me most
ISABELLA To whom should I complain Did I tell this
Who would believe me O perilous mouths
Either of condemnation or approof
Bidding the law make curtsy to their will
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
That had he twenty heads to tender down
Before his sister should her body stoop
Then Isabel live chaste and brother die
More than our brother is our chastity

ACT III SCENE I
The prison
Enter DUKE disguised as before CLAUDIO and PROVOST
DUKE So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo
CLAUDIO The miserable have no other medicine
But only hope
DUKE Be absolute for death either death or life
Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life
If I do lose thee I do lose a thing
That none but fools would keep A breath thou art
Servile to all the skyey influences
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep
Thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself
For thou exists on many a thousand grains
That issue out of dust Happy thou art not
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects
For like an ass whose back with ingots bows
And Death unloads thee Friend hast thou none
For thine own bowels which do call thee sire
The mere effusion of thy proper loins
Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age
Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
That bears the name of life Yet in this life
Lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear
That makes these odds all even
CLAUDIO I humbly thank you
To sue to live I find I seek to die
And seeking death find life Let it come on
CLAUDIO Most holy sir I thank you
Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA My business is a word or two with Claudio
DUKE Provost a word with you
PROVOST As many as you please
Exeunt DUKE and PROVOST
ISABELLA Why
As all comforts are most good most good indeed
Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven
Intends you for his swift ambassador
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger
Therefore your best appointment make with speed
CLAUDIO Is there no remedy
ISABELLA None but such remedy as to save a head
To cleave a heart in twain
CLAUDIO But is there any
ISABELLA Yes brother you may live
There is a devilish mercy in the judge
But fetter you till death
CLAUDIO Perpetual durance
ISABELLA Ay just perpetual durance a restraint
CLAUDIO But in what nature
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
And leave you naked
CLAUDIO Let me know the point
ISABELLA O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
And six or seven winters more respect
The sense of death is most in apprehension
And the poor beetle that we tread upon
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
As when a giant dies
CLAUDIO Why give you me this shame
Think you I can a resolution fetch
I will encounter darkness as a bride
And hug it in mine arms
Did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die
Thou art too noble to conserve a life
Whose settled visage and deliberate word
As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
His filth within being cast he would appear
A pond as deep as hell
CLAUDIO The precise Angelo
In precise guards Dost thou think Claudio
If I would yield him my virginity
Thou mightst be freed
CLAUDIO O heavens it cannot be
That I should do what I abhor to name
ISABELLA O were it but my life
As frankly as a pin
CLAUDIO Thanks dear Isabel
CLAUDIO Yes Has he affections in him
When he would force it Sure it is no sin
Or of the deadly seven it is the least
ISABELLA Which is the least
CLAUDIO If it were damnable he being so wise
Why would he for the momentary trick
ISABELLA What says my brother
CLAUDIO Death is a fearful thing
ISABELLA And shamed life a hateful
CLAUDIO Ay but to die and go we know not where
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot
This sensible warm motion to become
A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
To bathe in fiery floods or to reside
And blown with restless violence round about
The pendent world or to be worse than worst
Of those that lawless and incertain thought
The weariest and most loathed worldly life
That age ache penury and imprisonment
Can lay on nature is a paradise
To what we fear of death
ISABELLA Alas alas
CLAUDIO Sweet sister let me live
Nature dispenses with the deed so far
That it becomes a virtue
ISABELLA O you beast
O faithless coward O dishonest wretch
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
For such a warped slip of wilderness
Die perish Might but my bending down
Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed
No word to save thee
CLAUDIO Nay hear me Isabel
ISABELLA O fie fie fie
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd
CLAUDIO O hear me Isabella
DUKE Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
ISABELLA What is your will
DUKE Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have
some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is
likewise your own benefit
ISABELLA I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out
of other affairs but I will attend you awhile
sister Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath
made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the
disposition of natures She having the truth of honour in her
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to
receive I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true
therefore prepare yourself to death Do not satisfy your
go to your knees and make ready
CLAUDIO Let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life
that I will sue to be rid of it
you
DUKE That now you are come you will be gone Leave me a while
with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch
her by my company
PROVOST In good time                            Exit PROVOST
DUKE The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the
goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness
but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body
of it ever fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you
hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo How
will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother
ISABELLA I am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother
die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born But O how
I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his
government
DUKE That shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands
he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in
doing good a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited
benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to
your own gracious person and much please the absent Duke if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this
business
ISABELLA Let me hear you speak farther I have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
DUKE Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have you not
heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great
soldier who miscarried at sea
ISABELLA I have heard of the lady and good words went with her
name
DUKE She should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by
oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the
contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was
sister But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman
there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward
her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
ISABELLA Can this be so Did Angelo so leave her
DUKE Left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his
comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries
she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is
washed with them but relents not
ISABELLA What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from
the world What corruption in this life that it will let this man
live But how out of this can she avail
DUKE It is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it
not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in
doing it
ISABELLA Show me how good father
DUKE This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her
first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should
have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current
made it more violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to
the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that
your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all
shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience
advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your
place If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may
compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother
saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana advantaged and
the corrupt deputy scaled The maid will I frame and make fit for
his attempt If you think well to carry this as you may the
doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof What
think you of it
ISABELLA The image of it gives me content already and I trust it
will grow to a most prosperous perfection
DUKE It lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily to
Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him
at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana At that
place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo that it may be
quickly
ISABELLA I thank you for this comfort Fare you well good father
Exeunt severally
Scene II
The street before the prison
Enter on one side DUKE disguised as before on the other ELBOW
and OFFICERS with POMPEY
ELBOW Nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs
buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the
world drink brown and white bastard
DUKE O heavens what stuff is here
signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the
facing
ELBOW Come your way sir Bless you good father friar
DUKE And you good brother father What offence hath this man made
you sir
ELBOW Marry sir he hath offended the law and sir we take him
to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a
strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy
DUKE Fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd
The evil that thou causest to be done
That is thy means to live Do thou but think
From such a filthy vice say to thyself
Canst thou believe thy living is a life
So stinkingly depending Go mend go mend
POMPEY Indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir
DUKE Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin
Thou wilt prove his Take him to prison officer
Correction and instruction must both work
Ere this rude beast will profit
ELBOW He must before the deputy sir he has given him warning
The deputy cannot abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger
and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand
DUKE That we were all as some would seem to be
From our faults as his faults from seeming free
Enter LUCIO
of mine
LUCIO How now noble Pompey What at the wheels of Caesar Art
newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the
man Which is the way Is it sad and few words or how The
trick of it
DUKE Still thus and thus still worse
LUCIO How doth my dear morsel thy mistress Procures she still
POMPEY Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is
herself in the tub
consequence it must be so Art going to prison Pompey
POMPEY Yes faith sir
ELBOW For being a bawd for being a bawd
LUCIO Well then imprison him If imprisonment be the due of a
the prison Pompey You will turn good husband now Pompey you
will keep the house
POMPEY I hope sir your good worship will be my bail
LUCIO No indeed will I not Pompey it is not the wear I will
pray Pompey to increase your bondage If you take it not
patiently why your mettle is the more Adieu trusty Pompey
Bless you friar
DUKE And you
LUCIO Does Bridget paint still Pompey ha
ELBOW Come your ways sir come
POMPEY You will not bail me then sir
LUCIO Then Pompey nor now What news abroad friar what news
ELBOW Come your ways sir come
LUCIO Go to kennel Pompey go
Exeunt ELBOW POMPEY and OFFICERS
What news friar of the Duke
DUKE I know none Can you tell me of any
LUCIO Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is
in Rome but where is he think you
DUKE I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well
LUCIO It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the
state and usurp the beggary he was never born to Lord Angelo
LUCIO A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him
something too crabbed that way friar
DUKE It is too general a vice and severity must cure it
LUCIO Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is
well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till
eating and drinking be put down They say this Angelo was not
made by man and woman after this downright way of creation Is it
true think you
DUKE How should he be made then
DUKE You are pleasant sir and speak apace
LUCIO Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion
of a codpiece to take away the life of a man Would the Duke that
getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a
thousand He had some feeling of the sport he knew the service
and that instructed him to mercy
DUKE I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women he was
him He would be drunk too that let me inform you
DUKE You do him wrong surely
LUCIO Sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the Duke and
I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing
DUKE What I prithee might be the cause
and the lips but this I can let you understand the greater file
of the subject held the Duke to be wise
DUKE Wise Why no question but he was
LUCIO A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
DUKE Either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very
stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a
warranted need give him a better proclamation Let him be but
the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier Therefore you
speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much
LUCIO Sir I know him and I love him
DUKE Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer
love
LUCIO Come sir I know what I know
DUKE I can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak
But if ever the Duke return as our prayers are he may let me
desire you to make your answer before him If it be honest you
have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call
upon you and I pray you your name
LUCIO Sir my name is Lucio well known to the Duke
DUKE He shall know you better sir if I may live to report you
LUCIO I fear you not
DUKE O you hope the Duke will return no more or you imagine me
too unhurtful an opposite But indeed I can do you little harm
DUKE Why should he die sir
unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in
have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to
for untrussing Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The
past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar
though she smelt brown bread and garlic Say that I said so
Farewell                                               Exit
DUKE No might nor greatness in mortality
The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
But who comes here
Enter ESCALUS PROVOST and OFFICERS with
MISTRESS OVERDONE
ESCALUS Go away with her to prison
MRS OVERDONE Good my lord be good to me your honour is
accounted a merciful man good my lord
ESCALUS Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the
same kind This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant
honour
come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes
about to abuse me
with divines and have all charitable preparation If my brother
wrought by my pity it should not be so with him
ESCALUS Good even good father
DUKE Bliss and goodness on you
ESCALUS Of whence are you
DUKE Not of this country though my chance is now
To use it for my time I am a brother
Of gracious order late come from the See
In special business from his Holiness
DUKE None but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the
dissolution of it must cure it Novelty is only in request and
as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is
virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough
to make fellowships accurst Much upon this riddle runs the
wisdom of the world This news is old enough yet it is every
ESCALUS One that above all other strifes contended especially to
know himself
DUKE What pleasure was he given to
ESCALUS Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
temperance But leave we him to his events with a prayer they
may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find
visitation
DUKE He professes to have received no sinister measure from his
judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of
justice Yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his
frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good
ESCALUS You have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner
gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother
he is indeed Justice
DUKE If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it
shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath
ESCALUS I am going to visit the prisoner Fare you well
DUKE Peace be with you            Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST
He who the sword of heaven will bear
Should be as holy as severe
Pattern in himself to know
Grace to stand and virtue go
More nor less to others paying
Shame to him whose cruel striking
Kills for faults of his own liking
Twice treble shame on Angelo
To weed my vice and let his grow
O what may man within him hide
Though angel on the outward side
How may likeness made in crimes
Make a practice on the times
Most ponderous and substantial things
Craft against vice I must apply
His old betrothed but despised
Pay with falsehood false exacting
And perform an old contracting                    Exit
Act IV Scene I
Enter MARIANA and BOY singing
SONG
Take O take those lips away
That so sweetly were forsworn
And those eyes the break of day
Lights that do mislead the morn
But my kisses bring again bring again
Enter DUKE disguised as before
MARIANA Break off thy song and haste thee quick away
Here comes a man of comfort whose advice
I cry you mercy sir and well could wish
You had not found me here so musical
Let me excuse me and believe me so
To make bad good and good provoke to harm
Enter ISABELLA
DUKE I do constantly believe you The time is come even now I
shall crave your forbearance a little May be I will call upon
you anon for some advantage to yourself
MARIANA I am always bound to you                        Exit
DUKE Very well met and well come
What is the news from this good deputy
And to that vineyard is a planched gate
That makes his opening with this bigger key
This other doth command a little door
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads
There have I made my promise
Upon the heavy middle of the night
To call upon him
DUKE But shall you on your knowledge find this way
With whispering and most guilty diligence
In action all of precept he did show me
DUKE Are there no other tokens
Can be but brief for I have made him know
I have a servant comes with me along
That stays upon me whose persuasion is
I come about my brother
I have not yet made known to Mariana
A word of this What ho within come forth
I pray you be acquainted with this maid
She comes to do you good
ISABELLA I do desire the like
DUKE Do you persuade yourself that I respect you
MARIANA Good friar I know you do and have found it
DUKE Take then this your companion by the hand
Who hath a story ready for your ear
I shall attend your leisure but make haste
The vaporous night approaches
Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA
DUKE O place and greatness Millions of false eyes
Are stuck upon thee Volumes of report
Run with these false and most contrarious quest
Upon thy doings Thousand escapes of wit
Make thee the father of their idle dream
And rack thee in their fancies
Welcome how agreed
If you advise it
DUKE It is not my consent
But my entreaty too
ISABELLA Little have you to say
When you depart from him but soft and low
MARIANA Fear me not
DUKE Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
Sith that the justice of your title to him
Doth flourish the deceit Come let us go
SCENE II
The prison

POMPEY If the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a
PROVOST Come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct

helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem
you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of
imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for

POMPEY Sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet
I will be content to be a lawful hangman I would be glad to
receive some instructions from my fellow partner
Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON Do you call sir

and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present
and dismiss him He cannot plead his estimation with you he hath
been a bawd
ABHORSON A bawd sir Fie upon him He will discredit our mystery
PROVOST Go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the
scale                                                  Exit
sir your occupation a mystery
ABHORSON Ay sir a mystery
POMPEY Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your
whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do
prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be
ABHORSON Sir it is a mystery
POMPEY Proof
little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it
be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so
PROVOST Are you agreed
POMPEY Sir I will serve him for I do find your hangman is a more
penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness
ABHORSON Come on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow
POMPEY I do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have occasion
to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly
sir for your kindness I owe you a good turn
PROVOST Call hither Barnardine and Claudio
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
Being a murderer though he were my brother
Enter CLAUDIO
He will not wake
PROVOST Who can do good on him
noise
Heaven give your spirits comfort               Exit CLAUDIO
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
For the most gentle Claudio
Enter DUKE disguised as before
Welcome father
PROVOST None since the curfew rung
DUKE Not Isabel
PROVOST No
PROVOST What comfort is for Claudio
PROVOST It is a bitter deputy
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice
He doth with holy abstinence subdue
Which he corrects then were he tyrannous
come                                         Exit PROVOST
This is a gentle provost seldom when
PROVOST There he must stay until the officer
DUKE Have you no countermand for Claudio yet
PROVOST None sir none
DUKE As near the dawning Provost as it is
You shall hear more ere morning
PROVOST Happily
You something know yet I believe there comes
No countermand no such example have we
Besides upon the very siege of justice
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
Enter a MESSENGER
MESSENGER My lord hath sent you this note and by me this further
charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it
neither in time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for
as I take it it is almost day
PROVOST I shall obey him                      Exit MESSENGER
For which the pardoner himself is in
Hence hath offence his quick celerity
When it is borne in high authority
Now sir what news
PROVOST I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine
Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon
head sent me by five Let this be duly performed with a thought
that more depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not
What say you to this sir
afternoon
One that is a prisoner nine years old
to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his
manner to do so
PROVOST His friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed
his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to
an undoubted proof
DUKE It is now apparent
PROVOST Most manifest and not denied by himself
DUKE Hath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to
PROVOST A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a
present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately
mortal
DUKE He wants advice
PROVOST He will hear none He hath evermore had the liberty of the
prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many
times a day if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft
seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all
DUKE More of him anon There is written in your brow Provost
honesty and constancy If I read it not truly my ancient skill
beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself
in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no
make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four
a dangerous courtesy
PROVOST Pray sir in what
DUKE In the delaying death
PROVOST Alack How may I do it having the hour limited and an
express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view
smallest
DUKE By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions
may be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed
and his head borne to Angelo
PROVOST Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the
common If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and
good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against
it with my life
PROVOST Pardon me good father it is against my oath
DUKE Were you sworn to the Duke or to the deputy
PROVOST To him and to his substitutes
DUKE You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch
the justice of your dealing
PROVOST But what likelihood is in that
DUKE Not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you
fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can
with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck
all fears out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of
the Duke You know the character I doubt not and the signet is
not strange to you
PROVOST I know them both
DUKE The contents of this is the return of the Duke you shall
these two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows
not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour
unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into
amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but
easy when they are known Call your executioner and off with
absolutely resolve you Come away it is almost clear dawn
Exeunt
SCENE III
The prison
Enter POMPEY
POMPEY I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of
ginger nine score and seventeen pounds of which he made five
marks ready money Marry then ginger was not much in request
for the old women were all dead Then is there here one Master
Caper at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer for some four
Then have we here young Dizy and young Master Deepvow and
Master Copperspur and Master Starvelackey the rapier and dagger
Forthlight the tilter and brave Master Shootie the great
Enter ABHORSON
ABHORSON Sirrah bring Barnardine hither
Barnardine
ABHORSON What ho Barnardine

POMPEY Your friends sir the hangman You must be so good sir
to rise and be put to death
ABHORSON Tell him he must awake and that quickly too
POMPEY Pray Master Barnardine awake till you are executed and
sleep afterwards
ABHORSON Go in to him and fetch him out
POMPEY He is coming sir he is coming I hear his straw rustle
Enter BARNARDINE
ABHORSON Is the axe upon the block sirrah
POMPEY Very ready sir
ABHORSON Truly sir I would desire you to clap into your prayers
BARNARDINE You rogue I have been drinking all night I am not
POMPEY O the better sir For he that drinks all night and is
hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next
day
Enter DUKE disguised as before
ABHORSON Look you sir here comes your ghostly father
Do we jest now think you
DUKE Sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are
to depart I am come to advise you comfort you and pray with
you
BARNARDINE Friar not I I have been drinking hard all night and
I will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my
certain
DUKE O Sir you must and therefore I beseech you
Look forward on the journey you shall go
BARNARDINE Not a word if you have anything to say to me come to
DUKE Unfit to live or die O gravel heart
After him fellows bring him to the block
Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY
Enter PROVOST
PROVOST Now sir how do you find the prisoner
And to transport him in the mind he is
Were damnable
PROVOST Here in the prison father
There died this morning of a cruel fever
One Ragozine a most notorious pirate
Just of his colour What if we do omit
And satisfy the deputy with the visage
Of Ragozine more like to Claudio
Dispatch it presently the hour draws on
And sent according to command whiles I
Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die
PROVOST This shall be done good father presently
But Barnardine must die this afternoon
And how shall we continue Claudio
To save me from the danger that might come
If he were known alive
DUKE Let this be done
Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
To the under generation you shall find
Your safety manifested
PROVOST I am your free dependant
DUKE Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo
Exit PROVOST
Shall witness to him I am near at home
And that by great injunctions I am bound
To meet me at the consecrated fount
A league below the city and from thence
We shall proceed with Angelo
DUKE Convenient is it Make a swift return
For I would commune with you of such things
That want no ear but yours
But I will keep her ignorant of her good
To make her heavenly comforts of despair
When it is least expected
Enter ISABELLA
ISABELLA Ho by your leave
DUKE Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter
ISABELLA The better given me by so holy a man
His head is off and sent to Angelo
ISABELLA Nay but it is not so
DUKE It is no other
Show your wisdom daughter in your close patience
ISABELLA O I will to him and pluck out his eyes
DUKE You shall not be admitted to his sight
ISABELLA Unhappy Claudio Wretched Isabel
Injurious world Most damned Angelo
DUKE This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot
Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven
Mark what I say which you shall find
By every syllable a faithful verity
One of our covent and his confessor
Gives me this instance Already he hath carried
Notice to Escalus and Angelo
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates
In that good path that I would wish it go
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch
Grace of the Duke revenges to your heart
And general honour
ISABELLA I am directed by you
DUKE This letter then to Friar Peter give
Say by this token I desire his company
Before the Duke and to the head of Angelo
Accuse him home and home For my poor self
I am combined by a sacred vow
And shall be absent Wend you with this letter
Command these fretting waters from your eyes
With a light heart trust not my holy order
Enter LUCIO
DUKE Not within sir
LUCIO O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes
so red Thou must be patient I am fain to dine and sup with
water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one
old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home he had
lived                                         Exit ISABELLA
DUKE Sir the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports
but the best is he lives not in them
tales of the Duke
DUKE You have told me too many of him already sir if they be
true if not true none were enough
LUCIO I was once before him for getting a wench with child
DUKE Did you such a thing
LUCIO Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would
else have married me to the rotten medlar
DUKE Sir your company is fairer than honest Rest you well
kind of burr I shall stick                          Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS
ANGELO In most uneven and distracted manner His actions show much
like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why
meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there
ESCALUS I guess not
ANGELO And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
exhibit their petitions in the street
ESCALUS He shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of
complaints and to deliver us from devices hereafter which
shall then have no power to stand against us
Give notice to such men of sort and suit
As are to meet him
ESCALUS I shall sir fare you well
ANGELO Good night                               Exit ESCALUS
This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
The law against it But that her tender shame
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss
How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no
For my authority bears a so credent bulk
That no particular scandal once can touch
Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense
Alack when once our grace we have forgot
Nothing goes right we would and we would not         Exit
SCENE V
Fields without the town
Enter DUKE in his own habit and Friar PETER
The Provost knows our purpose and our plot
The matter being afoot keep your instruction
And hold you ever to our special drift
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that
And tell him where I stay give the like notice
To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
But send me Flavius first
PETER It shall be speeded well                  Exit FRIAR
Enter VARRIUS
DUKE I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste
Will greet us here anon My gentle Varrius           Exeunt
SCENE VI
A street near the city gate
Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA
ISABELLA To speak so indirectly I am loath
I would say the truth but to accuse him so
He says to veil full purpose
ISABELLA Besides he tells me that if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side
Enter FRIAR PETER
ISABELLA O peace the friar is come
PETER Come I have found you out a stand most fit
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke
He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates and very near upon

ACT V SCENE I
The city gate
Enter at several doors DUKE VARRIUS LORDS ANGELO ESCALUS Lucio
PROVOST OFFICERS and CITIZENS
DUKE My very worthy cousin fairly met
Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
ANGELO ESCALUS Happy return be to your royal Grace
DUKE Many and hearty thankings to you both
We have made inquiry of you and we hear
Such goodness of your justice that our soul
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
Forerunning more requital
ANGELO You make my bonds still greater
DUKE O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom
When it deserves with characters of brass
And razure of oblivion Give me your hand
And let the subject see to make them know
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
Favours that keep within Come Escalus
You must walk by us on our other hand
And good supporters are you
Enter FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA
PETER Now is your time speak loud and kneel before him
ISABELLA Justice O royal Duke Vail your regard
O worthy Prince dishonour not your eye
By throwing it on any other object
Till you have heard me in my true complaint
And given me justice justice justice justice
DUKE Relate your wrongs In what By whom Be brief
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice
Reveal yourself to him
ISABELLA O worthy Duke
You bid me seek redemption of the devil
Hear me yourself for that which I must speak
Or wring redress from you Hear me O hear me here
ANGELO My lord her wits I fear me are not firm
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
ISABELLA By course of justice
ANGELO And she will speak most bitterly and strange
ISABELLA Most strange but yet most truly will I speak
That Angelo is an adulterous thief
Is it not strange and strange
DUKE Nay it is ten times strange
ISABELLA It is not truer he is Angelo
Than this is all as true as it is strange
Nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
DUKE Away with her Poor soul
There is another comfort than this world
That thou neglect me not with that opinion
May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
As Angelo even so may Angelo
In all his dressings characts titles forms
Had I more name for badness
DUKE By mine honesty
If she be mad as I believe no other
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
Such a dependency of thing on thing
ISABELLA O gracious Duke
Harp not on that nor do not banish reason
For inequality but let your reason serve
To make the truth appear where it seems hid
And hide the false seems true
DUKE Many that are not mad
Have sure more lack of reason What would you say
ISABELLA I am the sister of one Claudio
I in probation of a sisterhood
Was sent to by my brother one Lucio
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
DUKE You were not bid to speak
LUCIO No my good lord
DUKE I wish you now then
Pray you take note of it and when you have
A business for yourself pray heaven you then
Be perfect
LUCIO I warrant your honour
ISABELLA This gentleman told somewhat of my tale
LUCIO Right
To speak before your time Proceed
ISABELLA I went
To this pernicious caitiff deputy
ISABELLA Pardon it
The phrase is to the matter
I now begin with grief and shame to utter
He would not but by gift of my chaste body
To his concupiscible intemperate lust
Release my brother and after much debatement
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
And I did yield to him But the next morn betimes
His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
DUKE This is most likely
ISABELLA O that it were as like as it is true
In hateful practice First his integrity
Stands without blemish next it imports no reason
That with such vehemency he should pursue
Faults proper to himself If he had so offended
And not have cut him off Some one hath set you on
Confess the truth and say by whose advice
ISABELLA And is this all
Then O you blessed ministers above
Keep me in patience and with ripened time
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
In countenance Heaven shield your Grace from woe
To prison with her Shall we thus permit
A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
On him so near us This needs must be a practice
Who knew of your intent and coming hither
ISABELLA One that I would were here Friar Lodowick
DUKE A ghostly father belike Who knows that Lodowick
I do not like the man had he been lay my lord
For certain words he spake against your Grace
And to set on this wretched woman here
Against our substitute Let this friar be found
LUCIO But yesternight my lord she and that friar
I saw them at the prison a saucy friar
A very scurvy fellow
PETER Blessed be your royal Grace
I have stood by my lord and I have heard
Who is as free from touch or soil with her
As she from one ungot
DUKE We did believe no less
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of
PETER I know him for a man divine and holy
Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
And on my trust a man that never yet
Did as he vouches misreport your Grace
LUCIO My lord most villainously believe it
PETER Well he in time may come to clear himself
But at this instant he is sick my lord
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
To speak as from his mouth what he doth know
Is true and false and what he with his oath
And all probation will make up full clear
To justify this worthy nobleman
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
Till she herself confess it
Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo
O heaven the vanity of wretched fools
Give us some seats Come cousin Angelo
Of your own cause
Enter MARIANA veiled
Is this the witness friar
FIRST let her show her face and after speak
MARIANA Pardon my lord I will not show my face
Until my husband bid me
DUKE What are you married
MARIANA No my lord
DUKE Are you a maid
MARIANA No my lord
DUKE A widow then
MARIANA Neither my lord
DUKE Why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife
LUCIO My lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither
maid widow nor wife
DUKE Silence that fellow I would he had some cause
To prattle for himself
LUCIO Well my lord
And I confess besides I am no maid
I have known my husband yet my husband
Knows not that ever he knew me
LUCIO He was drunk then my lord it can be no better
DUKE For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
LUCIO Well my lord
DUKE This is no witness for Lord Angelo
She that accuses him of fornication
And charges him my lord with such a time
ANGELO Charges she moe than me
MARIANA Not that I know
DUKE No You say your husband
MARIANA Why just my lord and that is Angelo
MARIANA My husband bids me now I will unmask
This is that face thou cruel Angelo
That took away the match from Isabel
DUKE Know you this woman
LUCIO Carnally she says
DUKE Sirrah no more
LUCIO Enough my lord
ANGELO My lord I must confess I know this woman
And five years since there was some speech of marriage
Betwixt myself and her which was broke off
Partly for that her promised proportions
Came short of composition but in chief
For that her reputation was disvalued
In levity Since which time of five years
I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
Upon my faith and honour
MARIANA Noble Prince
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
As words could make up vows And my good lord
He knew me as a wife As this is true
Let me in safety raise me from my knees
Or else for ever be confixed here
A marble monument
ANGELO I did but smile till now
Now good my lord give me the scope of justice
These poor informal women are no more
But instruments of some more mightier member
That sets them on Let me have way my lord
To find this practice out
DUKE Ay with my heart
And punish them to your height of pleasure
Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
Though they would swear down each particular saint
Were testimonies against his worth and credit
Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
There is another friar that set them on
Let him be sent for
PETER Would lie were here my lord For he indeed
Hath set the women on to this complaint
Your provost knows the place where he abides
And he may fetch him
DUKE Go do it instantly                        Exit PROVOST
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
Do with your injuries as seems you best
In any chastisement I for a while will leave you
Upon these slanderers
Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be
a dishonest person
clothes and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the
Duke
ESCALUS We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
enforce them against him We shall find this friar a notable
fellow
LUCIO As any in Vienna on my word
ESCALUS Call that same Isabel here once again I would speak with
LUCIO Not better than he by her own report
ESCALUS Say you
LUCIO Marry sir I think if you handled her privately she would
ESCALUS I will go darkly to work with her
you have said
LUCIO My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the
Provost
ESCALUS In very good time Speak not you to him till we call upon
you
LUCIO Mum
ESCALUS Come sir did you set these women on to slander Lord
ESCALUS How Know you where you are
DUKE Respect to your great place and let the devil
Look you speak justly
DUKE Boldly at least But O poor souls
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
Good night to your redress Is the Duke gone
Thus to retort your manifest appeal
Which here you come to accuse
LUCIO This is the rascal this is he I spoke of
ESCALUS Why thou unreverend and unhallowed friar
To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
And in the witness of his proper ear
To call him villain and then to glance from him
Joint by joint but we will know his purpose
DUKE Be not so hot the Duke
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
Dare rack his own his subject am I not
Nor here provincial My business in this state
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
As much in mock as mark
ANGELO What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio
Is this the man that you did tell us of
Do you know me
DUKE I remember you sir by the sound of your voice I met you at
the prison in the absence of the Duke
LUCIO O did you so And do you remember what you said of the Duke
DUKE Most notedly sir
LUCIO Do you so sir And was the Duke a fleshmonger a fool and
a coward as you then reported him to be
DUKE You must sir change persons with me ere you make that my
report you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse
LUCIO O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the nose for
thy speeches
DUKE I protest I love the Duke as I love myself
ANGELO Hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable
abuses
prison Where is the Provost Away with him to prison Lay bolts
enough upon him let him speak no more Away with those giglets
too and with the other confederate companion
DUKE Stay sir stay awhile
ANGELO What resists he Help him Lucio
LUCIO Come sir come sir come sir foh sir Why you
First Provost let me bail these gentle three
Must have a word anon Lay hold on him
LUCIO This may prove worse than hanging
Hast thou or word or wit or impudence
That yet can do thee office If thou hast
Rely upon it till my tale be heard
And hold no longer out
ANGELO O my dread lord
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness
To think I can be undiscernible
No longer session hold upon my shame
But let my trial be mine own confession
Immediate sentence then and sequent death
Is all the grace I beg
DUKE Come hither Mariana
ANGELO I was my lord
DUKE Go take her hence and marry her instantly
Do you the office friar which consummate
Return him here again Go with him Provost
Exeunt ANGELO MARIANA FRIAR PETER and PROVOST
Than at the strangeness of it
DUKE Come hither Isabel
Your friar is now your prince As I was then
Advertising and holy to your business
Not changing heart with habit I am still
ISABELLA O give me pardon
Your unknown sovereignty
And now dear maid be you as free to us
Labouring to save his life and would not rather
Than let him so be lost O most kind maid
It was the swift celerity of his death
Which I did think with slower foot came on
That life is better life past fearing death
Than that which lives to fear Make it your comfort
So happy is your brother
ISABELLA I do my lord
Being criminal in double violation
The very mercy of the law cries out
Most audible even from his proper tongue
Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
Like doth quit like and Measure still for Measure
Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
We do condemn thee to the very block
Away with him
MARIANA O my most gracious lord
I hope you will not mock me with a husband
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour
I thought your marriage fit else imputation
For that he knew you might reproach your life
And choke your good to come For his possessions
Although by confiscation they are ours
We do instate and widow you withal
To buy you a better husband
MARIANA O my dear lord
I crave no other nor no better man
DUKE Never crave him we are definitive
DUKE You do but lose your labour
MARIANA O my good lord Sweet Isabel take my part
Lend me your knees and all my life to come
DUKE Against all sense you do importune her
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
And take her hence in horror
MARIANA Isabel
Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me
They say best men moulded out of faults
And for the most become much more the better
For being a little bad so may my husband
O Isabel will you not lend a knee
Till he did look on me since it is so
Let him not die My brother had but justice
In that he did the thing for which he died
For Angelo
And must be buried but as an intent
Intents but merely thoughts
MARIANA Merely my lord
I have bethought me of another fault
Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded
At an unusual hour
PROVOST It was commanded so
DUKE Had you a special warrant for the deed
PROVOST No my good lord it was by private message
DUKE For which I do discharge you of your office
Give up your keys
PROVOST Pardon me noble lord
I thought it was a fault but knew it not
Yet did repent me after more advice
For testimony whereof one in the prison
That should by private order else have died
PROVOST His name is Barnardine
DUKE I would thou hadst done so by Claudio
Go fetch him hither let me look upon him      Exit PROVOST
ESCALUS I am sorry one so learned and so wise
Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
ANGELO I am sorry that such sorrow I procure
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
That I crave death more willingly than mercy
and JULIET
DUKE Which is that Barnardine
PROVOST This my lord
DUKE There was a friar told me of this man
Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
That apprehends no further than this world
But for those earthly faults I quit them all
And pray thee take this mercy to provide
For better times to come Friar advise him
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head
Give me your hand and say you will be mine
He is my brother too But fitter time for that
Well Angelo your evil quits you well
Look that you love your wife her worth worth yours
I find an apt remission in myself
One all of luxury an ass a madman
That you extol me thus
LUCIO Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the trick
If you will hang me for it you may but I had rather it would
please you I might be whipt
Proclaim it Provost round about the city
Whom he begot with child let her appear
LUCIO I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a whore Your
Highness said even now I made you a duke good my lord do not
recompense me in making me a cuckold
DUKE Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal
Remit thy other forfeits Take him to prison
And see our pleasure herein executed
LUCIO Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping
and hanging
DUKE Slandering a prince deserves it
Exeunt OFFICERS with LUCIO
Joy to you Mariana Love her Angelo
Thanks good friend Escalus for thy much goodness
Thanks Provost for thy care and secrecy
We shall employ thee in a worthier place
Forgive him Angelo that brought you home
I have a motion much imports your good
Exeunt

SCENE
ACT I SCENE I
Venice A street
Enter ANTONIO SALERIO and SOLANIO
ANTONIO In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wearies me you say it wearies you
But how I caught it found it or came by it
I am to learn
That I have much ado to know myself
SALERIO Your mind is tossing on the ocean
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
Do overpeer the petty traffickers
That curtsy to them do them reverence
As they fly by them with their woven wings
SOLANIO Believe me sir had I such venture forth
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad I should be still
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
Would make me sad
SALERIO My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague when I thought
What harm a wind too great might do at sea
But I should think of shallows and of flats
Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
Would scatter all her spices on the stream
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
And in a word but even now worth this
And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
To think on this and shall I lack the thought
But tell not me I know Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise
ANTONIO Believe me no I thank my fortune for it
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted
Nor to one place nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad
SOLANIO Why then you are in love
ANTONIO Fie fie
SOLANIO Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And other of such vinegar aspect
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
Enter BASSANIO LORENZO and GRATIANO
Here comes Bassanio your most noble kinsman
Gratiano and Lorenzo Fare ye well
We leave you now with better company
If worthier friends had not prevented me
ANTONIO Your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you
SALERIO Good morrow my good lords
BASSANIO Good signiors both when shall we laugh Say when
You grow exceeding strange must it be so
Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO
LORENZO My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio
I pray you have in mind where we must meet
BASSANIO I will not fail you
GRATIANO You look not well Signior Antonio
You have too much respect upon the world
They lose it that do buy it with much care
A stage where every man must play a part
And mine a sad one
GRATIANO Let me play the fool
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans
Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
And do a wilful stillness entertain
Of wisdom gravity profound conceit
O my Antonio I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing when I am very sure
If they should speak would almost damn those ears
Which hearing them would call their brothers fools
But fish not with this melancholy bait
For this fool gudgeon this opinion
Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile
I must be one of these same dumb wise men
For Gratiano never lets me speak
GRATIANO Well keep me company but two years moe
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO
ANTONIO Is that anything now
BASSANIO Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than
any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid
in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find
them and when you have them they are not worth the search
ANTONIO Well tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
How much I have disabled mine estate
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance
From such a noble rate but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
I owe the most in money and in love
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe
ANTONIO I pray you good Bassanio let me know it
And if it stand as you yourself still do
My purse my person my extremest means
To find the other forth and by adventuring both
I oft found both I urge this childhood proof
Because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilful youth
That which I owe is lost but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
As I will watch the aim or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first
ANTONIO You know me well and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done
And I am prest unto it therefore speak
BASSANIO In Belmont is a lady richly left
And she is fair and fairer than that word
Of wondrous virtues Sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece
And many Jasons come in quest of her
O my Antonio had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them
I have a mind presages me such thrift
That I should questionless be fortunate
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum therefore go forth
Try what my credit can in Venice do
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia
Go presently inquire and so will I
Where money is and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake                Exeunt
SCENE II
PORTIA By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this
great world
NERISSA You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the
same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught I
see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that
starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be
seated in the mean superfluity come sooner by white hairs but
competency lives longer
NERISSA They would be better if well followed
PORTIA If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do
palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I
can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one
of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise
counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike so is the will of a
hard Nerissa that I cannot choose one nor refuse none
NERISSA Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death
chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But
what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these
princely suitors that are already come
describe them and according to my description level at my
affection
NERISSA First there is the Neapolitan prince
his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good
NERISSA Then is there the County Palatine
he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so
full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married
these God defend me from these two
NERISSA How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon
PORTIA God made him and therefore let him pass for a man In
frowning than the Count Palatine he is every man in no man If a
his own shadow if I should marry him I should marry twenty
husbands If he would despise me I would forgive him for if he
love me to madness I shall never requite him
NERISSA What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of
England
PORTIA You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me
nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you
will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth
bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet
in Germany and his behaviour everywhere
NERISSA What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour
PORTIA That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed
a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him
again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety
nephew
PORTIA Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most
vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk When he is best he is
a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little
better than a beast An the worst fall that ever fell I hope I
shall make shift to go without him
NERISSA If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket
refuse to accept him
PORTIA Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep
glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be
within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I
will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge
NERISSA You need not fear lady the having any of these lords
they have acquainted me with their determinations which is
indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more
imposition depending on the caskets
PORTIA If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as
am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not
one among them but I dote on his very absence and I pray God
grant them a fair departure
Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of
the Marquis of Montferrat
NERISSA True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
PORTIA I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy
praise
Enter a SERVINGMAN
How now what news
SERVINGMAN The four strangers seek for you madam to take their
leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of
Morocco who brings word the Prince his master will be here
PORTIA If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I
can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his
approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion
of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me
Come Nerissa Sirrah go before
Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the
door                                               Exeunt
SCENE III
Venice A public place
Enter BASSANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew
BASSANIO Ay sir for three months
BASSANIO For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound
BASSANIO May you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your
answer
SHYLOCK Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound
BASSANIO Your answer to that
SHYLOCK Antonio is a good man
BASSANIO Have you heard any imputation to the contrary
SHYLOCK Ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man
is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means
are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another
to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a
waters winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding
will bethink me May I speak with Antonio
BASSANIO If it please you to dine with us
SHYLOCK Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your
prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with
you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so
following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray
with you What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here
Enter ANTONIO
BASSANIO This is Signior Antonio
I hate him for he is a Christian
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice
If I can catch him once upon the hip
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him
He hates our sacred nation and he rails
Even there where merchants most do congregate
Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe
If I forgive him
BASSANIO Shylock do you hear
SHYLOCK I am debating of my present store
And by the near guess of my memory
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats What of that
Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe
Will furnish me But soft how many months
Your worship was the last man in our mouths
ANTONIO Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess
Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend
How much ye would
SHYLOCK Ay ay three thousand ducats
ANTONIO And for three months
Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage
ANTONIO I do never use it
This Jacob from our holy Abram was
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf
ANTONIO And what of him Did he take interest
SHYLOCK No not take interest not as you would say
In end of autumn turned to the rams
And when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act
And in the doing of the deed of kind
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
This was a way to thrive and he was blest
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not
A thing not in his power to bring to pass
Was this inserted to make interest good
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams
SHYLOCK I cannot tell I make it breed as fast
But note me signior
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek
A goodly apple rotten at the heart
O what a goodly outside falsehood hath
ANTONIO Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you
SHYLOCK Signior Antonio many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine
And all for use of that which is mine own
Well then it now appears you need my help
Go to then you come to me and you say
You that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold moneys is your suit
What should I say to you Should I not say
Say this
ANTONIO I am as like to call thee so again
To spit on thee again to spurn thee too
If thou wilt lend this money lend it not
But lend it rather to thine enemy
Who if he break thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty
SHYLOCK Why look you how you storm
I would be friends with you and have your love
Supply your present wants and take no doit
This is kind I offer
BASSANIO This were kindness
SHYLOCK This kindness will I show
Go with me to a notary seal me there
Your single bond and in a merry sport
If you repay me not on such a day
In such a place such sum or sums as are
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me
And say there is much kindness in the Jew
BASSANIO You shall not seal to such a bond for me
ANTONIO Why fear not man I will not forfeit it
Of thrice three times the value of this bond
SHYLOCK O father Abram what these Christians are
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others Pray you tell me this
If he should break his day what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture
Is not so estimable profitable neither
As flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say
To buy his favour I extend this friendship
If he will take it so if not adieu
And for my love I pray you wrong me not
ANTONIO Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond
Give him direction for this merry bond
And I will go and purse the ducats straight
See to my house left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave and presently
ANTONIO Hie thee gentle Jew                    Exit SHYLOCK
The Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind
ANTONIO Come on in this there can be no dismay
My ships come home a month before the day            Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
Flourish of cornets Enter the PRINCE of MOROCCO a tawny Moor all in white
and three or four FOLLOWERS accordingly with PORTIA NERISSA and train
PRINCE OF Morocco Mislike me not for my complexion
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred
Bring me the fairest creature northward born
And let us make incision for your love
To prove whose blood is reddest his or mine
I tell thee lady this aspect of mine
Except to steal your thoughts my gentle queen
PORTIA In terms of choice I am not solely led
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing
But if my father had not scanted me
His wife who wins me by that means I told you
Yourself renowned Prince then stood as fair
For my affection
PRINCE OF MOROCCO Even for that I thank you
Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
To try my fortune By this scimitar
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth
To win thee lady But alas the while
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
Which is the better man the greater throw
May turn by fortune from the weaker band
So is Alcides beaten by his page
And so may I blind Fortune leading me
Miss that which one unworthier may attain
And die with grieving
PORTIA You must take your chance
And either not attempt to choose at all
Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong
Never to speak to lady afterward
PRINCE OF MOROCCO Nor will not come bring me unto my chance
PORTIA First forward to the temple After dinner
Your hazard shall be made
PRINCE OF MOROCCO Good fortune then
SCENE II
Venice A street
Enter LAUNCELOT GOBBO
LAUNCELOT Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this
Jew my master The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying
indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a
and to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend
Jew is the very devil incarnation and in my conscience my
conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more friendly
counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I
will run
Enter OLD GOBBO with a basket
GOBBO Master young man you I pray you which is the way to
I will try confusions with him

the next turning of all on your left marry at the very next
house
me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with him or
Launcelot
to live
Master Launcelot
LAUNCELOT But I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you talk
you of young Master Launcelot
LAUNCELOT Ergo Master Launcelot Talk not of Master Launcelot
father for the young gentleman according to Fates and Destinies
and such odd sayings the Sisters Three and such branches of
learning is indeed deceased or as you would say in plain
terms gone to heaven
GOBBO Marry God forbid The boy was the very staff of my age my
very prop
prop Do you know me father
GOBBO Alack the day I know you not young gentleman but I pray
LAUNCELOT Do you not know me father
LAUNCELOT Nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the
knowing me it is a wise father that knows his own child Well

GOBBO Pray you sir stand up I am sure you are not Launcelot my
boy

GOBBO I cannot think you are my son
LAUNCELOT I know not what I shall think of that but I am
mother

I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face
when I last saw him
LAUNCELOT Well well but for mine own part as I have set up my
rest to run away so I will not rest till I have run some ground
my ribs Father I am glad you are come give me your present to
one Master Bassanio who indeed gives rare new liveries if I
serve not him I will run as far as God has any ground O rare
fortune Here comes the man To him father for I am a Jew if I
serve the Jew any longer
Enter BASSANIO with LEONARDO with a FOLLOWER or two
BASSANIO You may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be
ready at the farthest by five of the clock See these letters
delivered put the liveries to making and desire Gratiano to
come anon to my lodging                      Exit a SERVANT
LAUNCELOT To him father
GOBBO God bless your worship
BASSANIO Gramercy wouldst thou aught with me
LAUNCELOT Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew and
LAUNCELOT To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having done
me wrong doth cause me as my father being I hope an old man
GOBBO I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your
LAUNCELOT In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as
your worship shall know by this honest old man and though I say
it though old man yet poor man my father
BASSANIO One speak for both What would you
LAUNCELOT Serve you sir
GOBBO That is the very defect of the matter sir
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day
The follower of so poor a gentleman
LAUNCELOT The old proverb is very well parted between my master
Shylock and you sir you have the grace of God sir and he hath
enough
Take leave of thy old master and inquire
And then to scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life
Exeunt LAUNCELOT and OLD GOBBO
BASSANIO I pray thee good Leonardo think on this
These things being bought and orderly bestowed
LEONARDO My best endeavours shall be done herein

GRATIANO Signior Bassanio
BASSANIO Gratiano
GRATIANO I have suit to you
GRATIANO You must not deny me I must go with you to Belmont
BASSANIO Why then you must But hear thee Gratiano
Parts that become thee happily enough
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults
But where thou art not known why there they show
Something too liberal Pray thee take pain
To allay with some cold drops of modesty
Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behaviour
And lose my hopes
GRATIANO Signior Bassanio hear me
If I do not put on a sober habit
Talk with respect and swear but now and then
Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes
Thus with my hat and sigh and say amen
Use all the observance of civility
Like one well studied in a sad ostent
To please his grandam never trust me more
BASSANIO Well we shall see your bearing
BASSANIO No that were pity
I would entreat you rather to put on
Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends
That purpose merriment But fare you well
I have some business
GRATIANO And I must to Lorenzo and the rest
SCENE III
Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT
JESSICA I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so
Our house is hell and thou a merry devil
Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness
But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee
And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see
Give him this letter do it secretly
And so farewell I would not have my father
See me in talk with thee
LAUNCELOT Adieu tears exhibit my tongue Most beautiful pagan
most sweet Jew If a Christian do not play the knave and get
thee I am much deceived But adieu these foolish drops do
something drown my manly spirit adieu
JESSICA Farewell good Launcelot              Exit LAUNCELOT
Alack what heinous sin is it in me
But though I am a daughter to his blood
I am not to his manners O Lorenzo
If thou keep promise I shall end this strife
Become a Christian and thy loving wife                 Exit
SCENE IV
Venice A street
Enter GRATIANO LORENZO SALERIO and SOLANIO
LORENZO Nay we will slink away in suppertime
Disguise us at my lodging and return
All in an hour
GRATIANO We have not made good preparation
And better in my mind not undertook
To furnish us
Enter LAUNCELOT With a letter
LAUNCELOT An it shall please you to break up this it shall seem
to signify
And whiter than the paper it writ on
Is the fair hand that writ
LAUNCELOT By your leave sir
LORENZO Whither goest thou
LAUNCELOT Marry sir to bid my old master the Jew to sup
LORENZO Hold here take this Tell gentle Jessica
I will not fail her speak it privately
Go gentlemen                                Exit LAUNCELOT
SOLANIO And so will I
LORENZO Meet me and Gratiano
GRATIANO Was not that letter from fair Jessica
LORENZO I must needs tell thee all She hath directed
And never dare misfortune cross her foot
Unless she do it under this excuse
That she is issue to a faithless Jew
Come go with me peruse this as thou goest
SCENE V
Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT
SHYLOCK Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge
Why Jessica I say
LAUNCELOT Why Jessica
SHYLOCK Who bids thee call I do not bid thee call
LAUNCELOT Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing
without bidding
Enter JESSICA
JESSICA Call you What is your will
SHYLOCK I am bid forth to supper Jessica
There are my keys But wherefore should I go
I am not bid for love they flatter me
The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl
Look to my house I am right loath to go
LAUNCELOT I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect your
reproach
SHYLOCK So do I his
LAUNCELOT And they have conspired together I will not say you
shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing
SHYLOCK What are there masques Hear you me Jessica
Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum
Clamber not you up to the casements then
Nor thrust your head into the public street
But I will go Go you before me sirrah
Say I will come
LAUNCELOT I will go before sir Mistress look out at window for
all this
There will come a Christian by
SHYLOCK The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder
Therefore I part with him and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrowed purse Well Jessica go in
Perhaps I will return immediately
Do as I bid you shut doors after you
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind                  Exit
JESSICA Farewell and if my fortune be not crost
I have a father you a daughter lost                  Exit
SCENE VI
Enter the maskers GRATIANO and SALERIO
Desired us to make stand
SALERIO His hour is almost past
For lovers ever run before the clock
To keep obliged faith unforfeited
GRATIANO That ever holds who riseth from a feast
With that keen appetite that he sits down
Where is the horse that doth untread again
His tedious measures with the unbated fire
That he did pace them first All things that are
Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed
How like a younker or a prodigal
The scarfed bark puts from her native bay
How like the prodigal doth she return
Enter LORENZO
SALERIO Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter
LORENZO Sweet friends your patience for my long abode
Not I but my affairs have made you wait
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives
JESSICA Who are you Tell me for more certainty
LORENZO Lorenzo and thy love
JESSICA Lorenzo certain and my love indeed
For who love I so much And now who knows
But you Lorenzo whether I am yours
LORENZO Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art
JESSICA Here catch this casket it is worth the pains
But love is blind and lovers cannot see
The pretty follies that themselves commit
For if they could Cupid himself would blush
To see me thus transformed to a boy
JESSICA What must I hold a candle to my shames
They in themselves good sooth are too too light
LORENZO So are you sweet
Even in the lovely garnish of a boy
But come at once
For the close night doth play the runaway
JESSICA I will make fast the doors and gild myself
With some moe ducats and be with you straight
Exit above
GRATIANO Now by my hood a gentle and no Jew
LORENZO Beshrew me but I love her heartily
For she is wise if I can judge of her
And fair she is if that mine eyes be true
And therefore like herself wise fair and true
Shall she be placed in my constant soul
Enter JESSICA below
What art thou come On gentlemen away
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay
Exit with JESSICA and SALERIO
Enter ANTONIO
GRATIANO Signior Antonio
ANTONIO Fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest
Bassanio presently will go aboard
I have sent twenty out to seek for you
SCENE VII
Flourish of cornets Enter PORTIA with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO
and their trains
PORTIA Go draw aside the curtains and discover
The several caskets to this noble Prince
Now make your choice
PRINCE OF MOROCCO The first of gold who this inscription bears
The second silver which this promise carries
This third dull lead with warning all as blunt
How shall I know if I do choose the right
PORTIA The one of them contains my picture Prince
If you choose that then I am yours withal
PRINCE OF MOROCCO Some god direct my judgment Let me see
What says this leaden casket
This casket threatens men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross
What says the silver with her virgin hue
As much as he deserves Pause there Morocco
And weigh thy value with an even hand
If thou beest rated by thy estimation
Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself
I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes
In graces and in qualities of breeding
But more than these in love I do deserve
From the four corners of the earth they come
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia
The watery kingdom whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits but they come
One of these three contains her heavenly picture
To think so base a thought it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold
O sinful thought Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within Deliver me the key
Here do I choose and thrive I as I may
PORTIA There take it Prince and if my form lie there
PRINCE OF MOROCCO O hell what have we here
A carrion Death within whose empty eye
Often have you heard that told
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold
Gilded tombs do worms infold
Had you been as wise as bold
Young in limbs in judgment old
Cold indeed and labour lost
Then farewell heat and welcome frost
To take a tedious leave thus losers part
Exit with his train Flourish of cornets
PORTIA A gentle riddance Draw the curtains go
Let all of his complexion choose me so               Exeunt
SCENE VIII
Venice A street
Enter SALERIO and SOLANIO
SALERIO Why man I saw Bassanio under sail
With him is Gratiano gone along
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not
SALERIO He came too late the ship was under sail
But there the Duke was given to understand
That in a gondola were seen together
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica
Besides Antonio certified the Duke
They were not with Bassanio in his ship
So strange outrageous and so variable
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets
Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats
Justice the law My ducats and my daughter
A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats
SALERIO Why all the boys in Venice follow him
Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats
SOLANIO Let good Antonio look he keep his day
Or he shall pay for this
Who told me in the narrow seas that part
The French and English there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught
I thought upon Antonio when he told me
SOLANIO You were best to tell Antonio what you hear
Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him
SALERIO A kinder gentleman treads not the earth
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time
Let it not enter in your mind of love
Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
And even there his eye being big with tears
Turning his face he put his hand behind him
And with affection wondrous sensible
SOLANIO I think he only loves the world for him
I pray thee let us go and find him out
And quicken his embraced heaviness
With some delight or other
SALERIO Do we so                                      Exeunt
SCENE IX
Enter NERISSA and a SERVITOR
NERISSA Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight
And comes to his election presently
Flourish of cornets Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON
PORTIA and their trains
PORTIA Behold there stand the caskets noble Prince
But if you fail without more speech my lord
You must be gone from hence immediately
First never to unfold to any one
Of the right casket never in my life
To woo a maid in way of marriage
Lastly
If I do fail in fortune of my choice
Immediately to leave you and be gone
PORTIA To these injunctions every one doth swear
That comes to hazard for my worthless self
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard
What says the golden chest Ha let me see
By the fool multitude that choose by show
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach
Builds in the weather on the outward wall
Even in the force and road of casualty
I will not choose what many men desire
Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear
And well said too for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity
O that estates degrees and offices
How many then should cover that stand bare
How many be commanded that command
How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
From the true seed of honour and how much honour
I will assume desert Give me a key for this
And instantly unlock my fortunes here
Presenting me a schedule I will read it
How much unlike art thou to Portia
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings
Is that my prize Are my deserts no better
PORTIA To offend and judge are distinct offices
And of opposed natures
Seven times tried that judgment is
That did never choose amiss
Some there be that shadows kiss
There be fools alive iwis
Take what wife you will to bed
I will ever be your head
Still more fool I shall appear
By the time I linger here
But I go away with two
Patiently to bear my wroth         Exit with his train
O these deliberate fools When they do choose
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose
NERISSA The ancient saying is no heresy
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny
PORTIA Come draw the curtain Nerissa
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT Where is my lady
PORTIA Here what would my lord
SERVANT Madam there is alighted at your gate
A young Venetian one that comes before
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets
To wit besides commends and courteous breath
Gifts of rich value Yet I have not seen
So likely an ambassador of love
A day in April never came so sweet
To show how costly summer was at hand
PORTIA No more I pray thee I am half afeard
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee
Come come Nerissa for I long to see
NERISSA Bassanio Lord Love if thy will it be        Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Venice A street
Enter SOLANIO and SALERIO
SOLANIO Now what news on the Rialto
they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the
carcases of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my
gossip Report be an honest woman of her word
ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a
third husband But it is true without any slips of prolixity or
crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the
SALERIO Come the full stop
SOLANIO Ha What sayest thou Why the end is he hath lost a
ship
SALERIO I would it might prove the end of his losses
SOLANIO Let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer
for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew
Enter SHYLOCK
How now Shylock What news among the merchants
SHYLOCK You knew none so well none so well as you of my
the wings she flew withal
SOLANIO And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was flidge
and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam
SHYLOCK My own flesh and blood to rebel
SOLANIO Out upon it old carrion Rebels it at these years
SHYLOCK I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood
SALERIO There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than
between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is
between red wine and Rhenish But tell us do you hear whether
Antonio have had any loss at sea or no
SHYLOCK There I have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal
who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto a beggar that was
was wont to call me usurer let him look to his bond He was wont
to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him look to his bond
SALERIO Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his
SHYLOCK To bait fish withal If it will feed nothing else it will
nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine
Hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections
passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons
subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed
and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is If
you prick us do we not bleed If you tickle us do we not laugh
If you poison us do we not die And if you wrong us shall we
not revenge If we are like you in the rest we will resemble you
in that If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility
Revenge If a Christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance
be by Christian example Why revenge The villainy you teach me
I will execute and itshall go hard but I will better the
instruction
Enter a MAN from ANTONIO
MAN Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and desires to
speak with you both

merchandise I will Go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go
good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal                  Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter BASSANIO PORTIA GRATIANO NERISSA and all their trains
PORTIA I pray you tarry pause a day or two
Before you hazard for in choosing wrong
I lose your company therefore forbear a while
I would not lose you and you know yourself
Hate counsels not in such a quality
I would detain you here some month or two
Before you venture for me I could teach you
How to choose right but then I am forsworn
So will I never be so may you miss me
That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes
Mine own I would say but if mine then yours
And so all yours O these naughty times
Puts bars between the owners and their rights
And so though yours not yours Prove it so
Let fortune go to hell for it not I
To eke it and to draw it out in length
To stay you from election
BASSANIO Let me choose
For as I am I live upon the rack
PORTIA Upon the rack Bassanio Then confess
What treason there is mingled with your love
BASSANIO None but that ugly treason of mistrust
There may as well be amity and life
PORTIA Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack
Where men enforced do speak anything
PORTIA Well then confess and live
Had been the very sum of my confession
O happy torment when my torturer
Doth teach me answers for deliverance
But let me to my fortune and the caskets
If you do love me you will find me out
Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof
Let music sound while he doth make his choice
Fading in music That the comparison
May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream
And what is music then Then music is
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
And summon him to marriage Now he goes
With no less presence but with much more love
Than young Alcides when he did redeem
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives
With bleared visages come forth to view
Live thou I live With much much more dismay
A SONG
the whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
Tell me where is fancy bred
Or in the heart or in the head
How begot how nourished
Reply reply
With gazing fed and fancy dies
In the cradle where it lies
ALL           Ding dong bell
BASSANIO So may the outward shows be least themselves
In law what plea so tainted and corrupt
Obscures the show of evil In religion
What damned error but some sober brow
Will bless it and approve it with a text
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament
There is no vice so simple but assumes
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts
How many cowards whose hearts are all as false
As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars
To render them redoubted Look on beauty
Which therein works a miracle in nature
Making them lightest that wear most of it
So are those crisped snaky golden locks
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
Upon supposed fairness often known
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty in a word
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold
Hard food for Midas I will none of thee
Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge
Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence
And here choose I Joy be the consequence
O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy
In measure rain thy joy scant this excess
I feel too much thy blessing Make it less
For fear I surfeit
Hath come so near creation Move these eyes
Or whether riding on the balls of mine
Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar
Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
How could he see to do them Having made one
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it so far this shadow
The continent and summary of my fortune
Chance as fair and choose as true
Since this fortune falls to you
Be content and seek no new
And hold your fortune for your bliss
Turn to where your lady is
A gentle scroll Fair lady by your leave
I come by note to give and to receive
Like one of two contending in a prize
Hearing applause and universal shout
Giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt
Whether those peals of praise be his or no
As doubtful whether what I see be true
PORTIA You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand
Such as I am Though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish
To wish myself much better yet for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself
A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich
That only to stand high in your account
I might in virtues beauties livings friends
Exceed account But the full sum of me
Is sum of something which to term in gross
Happy in this she is not yet so old
But she may learn happier than this
She is not bred so dull but she can learn
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed
As from her lord her governor her king
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted But now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion master of my servants
This house these servants and this same myself
Which when you part from lose or give away
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you
BASSANIO Madam you have bereft me of all words
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins
And there is such confusion in my powers
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude
Where every something being blent together
Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy
Parts from this finger then parts life from hence
NERISSA My lord and lady it is now our time
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper
GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady
I wish you all the joy that you can wish
For I am sure you can wish none from me
And when your honours mean to solemnize
The bargain of your faith I do beseech you
Even at that time I may be married too
BASSANIO With all my heart so thou canst get a wife
GRATIANO I thank your lordship you have got me one
My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours
You saw the mistress I beheld the maid
No more pertains to me my lord than you
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there
And so did mine too as the matter falls
For wooing here until I sweat again
And swearing till my very roof was dry
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love provided that your fortune
PORTIA Is this true Nerissa
BASSANIO And do you Gratiano mean good faith
GRATIANO Yes faith my lord
BASSANIO Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage
ducats
NERISSA What and stake down
But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel
What and my old Venetian friend Salerio
Enter LORENZO JESSICA and SALERIO a messenger
from Venice
BASSANIO Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither
Have power to bid you welcome By your leave
I bid my very friends and countrymen
Sweet Portia welcome
PORTIA So do I my lord
They are entirely welcome
LORENZO I thank your honour For my part my lord
My purpose was not to have seen you here
But meeting with Salerio by the way
He did entreat me past all saying nay
To come with him along
SALERIO I did my lord
And I have reason for it Signior Antonio
BASSANIO Ere I ope his letter
I pray you tell me how my good friend doth
SALERIO Not sick my lord unless it be in mind
Nor well unless in mind his letter there
GRATIANO Nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome
How doth that royal merchant good Antonio
I know he will be glad of our success
We are the Jasons we have won the fleece
SALERIO I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost
PORTIA There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man What worse and worse
With leave Bassanio I am half yourself
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you
BASSANIO O sweet Portia
That ever blotted paper Gentle lady
When I did first impart my love to you
I freely told you all the wealth I had
And then I told you true And yet dear lady
Rating myself at nothing you shall see
How much I was a braggart When I told you
My state was nothing I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing for indeed
To feed my means Here is a letter lady
The paper as the body of my friend
And every word in it a gaping wound
From Tripolis from Mexico and England
From Lisbon Barbary and India
And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
SALERIO Not one my lord
Besides it should appear that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew
He would not take it Never did I know
A creature that did bear the shape of man
So keen and greedy to confound a man
He plies the Duke at morning and at night
And doth impeach the freedom of the state
If they deny him justice Twenty merchants
The Duke himself and the magnificoes
Of greatest port have all persuaded with him
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture of justice and his bond
JESSICA When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him and I know my lord
If law authority and power deny not
It will go hard with poor Antonio
PORTIA Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble
BASSANIO The dearest friend to me the kindest man
In doing courtesies and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy
PORTIA What sum owes he the Jew
BASSANIO For me three thousand ducats
PORTIA What no more
Pay him six thousand and deface the bond
Double six thousand and then treble that
Before a friend of this description
First go with me to church and call me wife
And then away to Venice to your friend
With an unquiet soul You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over
When it is paid bring your true friend along
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows Come away
For you shall hence upon your wedding day
Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer
Since you are dear bought I will love you dear
But let me hear the letter of your friend
my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the
Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I
but see you at my death Notwithstanding use your pleasure if
PORTIA O love dispatch all business and be gone
BASSANIO Since I have your good leave to go away
I will make haste but till I come again
SCENE III
Venice A street
Enter SHYLOCK SOLANIO ANTONIO and GAOLER
This is the fool that lent out money gratis
Gaoler look to him
ANTONIO Hear me yet good Shylock
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond
But since I am a dog beware my fangs
The Duke shall grant me justice I do wonder
Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond
To come abroad with him at his request
ANTONIO I pray thee hear me speak
To shake the head relent and sigh and yield
To Christian intercessors Follow not
SOLANIO It is the most impenetrable cur
That ever kept with men
ANTONIO Let him alone
He seeks my life his reason well I know
Many that have at times made moan to me
Therefore he hates me
SOLANIO I am sure the Duke
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold
ANTONIO The Duke cannot deny the course of law
For the commodity that strangers have
With us in Venice if it be denied
Will much impeach the justice of the state
Since that the trade and profit of the city
Consisteth of all nations Therefore go
These griefs and losses have so bated me
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
Well gaoler on pray God Bassanio come
To see me pay his debt and then I care not          Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter PORTIA NERISSA LORENZO JESSICA and BALTHASAR
LORENZO Madam although I speak it in your presence
You have a noble and a true conceit
Of godlike amity which appears most strongly
In bearing thus the absence of your lord
But if you knew to whom you show this honour
How true a gentleman you send relief
How dear a lover of my lord your husband
I know you would be prouder of the work
Than customary bounty can enforce you
PORTIA I never did repent for doing good
Nor shall not now for in companions
That do converse and waste the time together
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love
There must be needs a like proportion
Of lineaments of manners and of spirit
Which makes me think that this Antonio
Being the bosom lover of my lord
Must needs be like my lord If it be so
How little is the cost I have bestowed
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish cruelty
This comes too near the praising of myself
Therefore no more of it hear other things
Lorenzo I commit into your hands
The husbandry and manage of my house
To live in prayer and contemplation
Only attended by Nerissa here
There is a monastery two miles off
And there we will abide I do desire you
Not to deny this imposition
The which my love and some necessity
Now lays upon you
LORENZO Madam with all my heart
I shall obey you in an fair commands
PORTIA My people do already know my mind
And will acknowledge you and Jessica
In place of Lord Bassanio and myself
So fare you well till we shall meet again
LORENZO Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you
To wish it back on you Fare you well Jessica
Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
Now Balthasar
So let me find thee still Take this same letter
In speed to Padua see thou render this
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee
Unto the traject to the common ferry
Which trades to Venice Waste no time in words
But get thee gone I shall be there before thee
BALTHASAR Madam I go with all convenient speed         Exit
PORTIA Come on Nerissa I have work in hand
Before they think of us
NERISSA Shall they see us
PORTIA They shall Nerissa but in such a habit
That they shall think we are accomplished
When we are both accoutred like young men
And wear my dagger with the braver grace
And speak between the change of man and boy
With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps
Into a manly stride and speak of frays
Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies
How honourable ladies sought my love
That men shall swear I have discontinued school
About a twelvemonth I have within my mind
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks
Which I will practise
NERISSA Why shall we turn to men
If thou wert near a lewd interpreter
When I am in my coach which stays for us
At the park gate and therefore haste away
SCENE V
Belmont The garden
Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA
LAUNCELOT Yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to
be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you
I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of
that is but a kind of bastard hope neither
JESSICA And what hope is that I pray thee
JESSICA That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my
mother should be visited upon me
mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into
Charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways
Christian
LAUNCELOT Truly the more to blame he we were Christians enow
making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all
coals for money
Enter LORENZO
comes
LORENZO I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you
thus get my wife into corners
JESSICA Nay you need nor fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I are
of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you
raise the price of pork
LORENZO I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you
by you Launcelot
LAUNCELOT It is much that the Moor should be more than reason but
if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I
took her for
LORENZO How every fool can play upon the word I think the best
grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow
commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them
prepare for dinner
LAUNCELOT That is done sir they have all stomachs
prepare dinner
LORENZO Will you cover then sir
LAUNCELOT Not so sir neither I know my duty
LORENZO Yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show the
whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a
plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover
the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner
let it be as humours and conceits shall govern
Exit
LORENZO O dear discretion how his words are suited
The fool hath planted in his memory
An army of good words and I do know
A many fools that stand in better place
And now good sweet say thy opinion
JESSICA Past all expressing It is very meet
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life
For having such a blessing in his lady
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth
And if on earth he do not merit it
In reason he should never come to heaven
Why if two gods should play some heavenly match
And on the wager lay two earthly women
And Portia one there must be something else
Hath not her fellow
LORENZO Even such a husband
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife
JESSICA Nay but ask my opinion too of that
LORENZO I will anon first let us go to dinner
JESSICA Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach
I shall digest it
ACT IV SCENE I
Venice The court of justice
Enter the DUKE the MAGNIFICOES ANTONIO BASSANIO GRATIANO SALERIO
and OTHERS
DUKE OF VENICE What is Antonio here
ANTONIO Ready so please your Grace
DUKE OF VENICE I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer
A stony adversary an inhuman wretch
Uncapable of pity void and empty
From any dram of mercy
ANTONIO I have heard
His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
To suffer with a quietness of spirit
The very tyranny and rage of his
DUKE OF VENICE Go one and call the Jew into the court
SALERIO He is ready at the door he comes my lord
Enter SHYLOCK
DUKE OF VENICE Make room and let him stand before our face
Shylock the world thinks and I think so too
That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty
And where thou now exacts the penalty
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture
Forgive a moiety of the principal
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint
To offices of tender courtesy
We all expect a gentle answer Jew
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond
If you deny it let the danger light
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
What if my house be troubled with a rat
Some men there are love not a gaping pig
Some that are mad if they behold a cat
Cannot contain their urine for affection
Mistress of passion sways it to the mood
Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig
Why he a harmless necessary cat
Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend himself being offended
So can I give no reason nor I will not
I bear Antonio that I follow thus
A losing suit against him Are you answered
BASSANIO This is no answer thou unfeeling man
To excuse the current of thy cruelty
SHYLOCK I am not bound to please thee with my answers
BASSANIO Do all men kill the things they do not love
SHYLOCK Hates any man the thing he would not kill
BASSANIO Every offence is not a hate at first
SHYLOCK What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice
ANTONIO I pray you think you question with the Jew
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height
You may as well use question with the wolf
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven
You may as well do anything most hard
His jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you
Make no moe offers use no farther means
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will
BASSANIO For thy three thousand ducats here is six
SHYLOCK If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts and every part a ducat
I would not draw them I would have my bond
SHYLOCK What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong
Which fike your asses and your dogs and mules
You use in abject and in slavish parts
Because you bought them shall I say to you
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
The pound of flesh which I demand of him
If you deny me fie upon your law
There is no force in the decrees of Venice
I stand for judgment answer shall I have it
DUKE OF VENICE Upon my power I may dismiss this court
Unless Bellario a learned doctor
Whom I have sent for to determine this
SALERIO My lord here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor
New come from Padua
DUKE OF VENICE Bring us the letters call the messenger
BASSANIO Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet
The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood
ANTONIO I am a tainted wether of the flock
Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground and so let me
Than to live still and write mine epitaph
DUKE OF VENICE Came you from Padua from Bellario
NERISSA From both my lord Bellario greets your Grace
BASSANIO Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly
SHYLOCK To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there
GRATIANO Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew
Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee
SHYLOCK No none that thou hast wit enough to make
To hold opinion with Pythagoras
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet
And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam
SHYLOCK Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond
Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall
To cureless ruin I stand here for law
DUKE OF VENICE This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court
Where is he
NERISSA He attendeth here hard by
DUKE OF VENICE With all my heart Some three or four of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place
of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your
messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor
in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant we
of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation
for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him
to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his
Enter PORTIA for BALTHAZAR dressed like a Doctor of Laws
And here I take it is the doctor come
Give me your hand come you from old Bellario
PORTIA I did my lord
DUKE OF VENICE You are welcome take your place
Are you acquainted with the difference
That holds this present question in the court
PORTIA I am informed throughly of the cause
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew
DUKE OF VENICE Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth
PORTIA Is your name Shylock
SHYLOCK Shylock is my name
PORTIA Of a strange nature is the suit you follow
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed
You stand within his danger do you not
ANTONIO Ay so he says
PORTIA Do you confess the bond
ANTONIO I do
PORTIA Then must the Jew be merciful
SHYLOCK On what compulsion must I Tell me that
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath It is twice blest
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
The throned monarch better than his crown
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power
The attribute to awe and majesty
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
But mercy is above this sceptred sway
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings
It is an attribute to God himself
When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation we do pray for mercy
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea
Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice
SHYLOCK My deeds upon my head I crave the law
The penalty and forfeit of my bond
BASSANIO Yes here I tender it for him in the court
Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice
On forfeit of my hands my head my heart
If this will not suffice it must appear
That malice bears down truth And I beseech you
Wrest once the law to your authority
To do a great right do a little wrong
And curb this cruel devil of his will
PORTIA It must not be there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state it cannot be
SHYLOCK A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel
O wise young judge how I do honour thee
PORTIA I pray you let me look upon the bond
SHYLOCK An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul
No not for Venice
PORTIA Why this bond is forfeit
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh to be by him cut off
Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond
SHYLOCK When it is paid according to the tenour
It doth appear you are a worthy judge
You know the law your exposition
Hath been most sound I charge you by the law
Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me I stay here on my bond
ANTONIO Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment
PORTIA Why then thus it is
You must prepare your bosom for his knife
SHYLOCK O noble judge O excellent young man
PORTIA For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty
Which here appeareth due upon the bond
How much more elder art thou than thy looks
PORTIA Therefore lay bare your bosom
So says the bond doth it not noble judge
PORTIA It is so Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh
SHYLOCK I have them ready
PORTIA Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge
To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death
SHYLOCK Is it so nominated in the bond
PORTIA You merchant have you anything to say
Give me your hand Bassanio fare you well
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom It is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
Of such misery doth she cut me off
Commend me to your honourable wife
And when the tale is told bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend
And he repents not that he pays your debt
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough
BASSANIO Antonio I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself
But life itself my wife and all the world
I would lose all ay sacrifice them all
Here to this devil to deliver you
PORTIA Your wife would give you little thanks for that
If she were by to hear you make the offer
GRATIANO I have a wife who I protest I love
I would she were in heaven so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew
The wish would make else an unquiet house
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence
The court awards it and the law doth give it
SHYLOCK Most rightful judge
PORTIA And you must cut this flesh from off his breast
The law allows it and the court awards it
SHYLOCK Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare
PORTIA Tarry a little there is something else
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood
Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh
But in the cutting it if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods
Are by the laws of Venice confiscate
Unto the state of Venice
GRATIANO O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge
SHYLOCK Is that the law
PORTIA Thyself shalt see the act
GRATIANO O learned judge Mark Jew A learned judge
SHYLOCK I take this offer then pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go
BASSANIO Here is the money
PORTIA Soft
The Jew shall have all justice Soft No haste
He shall have nothing but the penalty
GRATIANO O Jew an upright judge a learned judge
PORTIA Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh
Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more
As makes it light or heavy in the substance
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate
GRATIANO A second Daniel a Daniel Jew
Now infidel I have you on the hip
PORTIA Why doth the Jew pause Take thy forfeiture
SHYLOCK Give me my principal and let me go
BASSANIO I have it ready for thee here it is
He shall have merely justice and his bond
GRATIANO A Daniel still say I a second Daniel
I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word
SHYLOCK Shall I not have barely my principal
PORTIA Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture
To be so taken at thy peril Jew
SHYLOCK Why then the devil give him good of it
PORTIA Tarry Jew
The law hath yet another hold on you
It is enacted in the laws of Venice
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen
Shall seize one half his goods the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state
For it appears by manifest proceeding
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke
GRATIANO Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself
And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state
Thou hast not left the value of a cord
DUKE OF VENICE That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it
The other half comes to the general state
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine
PORTIA Ay for the state not for Antonio
SHYLOCK Nay take my life and all pardon not that
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live
PORTIA What mercy can you render him Antonio
ANTONIO So please my lord the Duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods
I am content so he will let me have
The other half in use to render it
Upon his death unto the gentleman
Two things provided more that for this favour
He presently become a Christian
The other that he do record a gift
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter
DUKE OF VENICE He shall do this or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here
PORTIA Art thou contented Jew What dost thou say
SHYLOCK I am content
PORTIA Clerk draw a deed of gift
SHYLOCK I pray you give me leave to go from hence
I am not well send the deed after me
And I will sign it
DUKE OF VENICE Get thee gone but do it
Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more
To bring thee to the gallows not to the font
Exit SHYLOCK
DUKE OF VENICE Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner
PORTIA I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon
I must away this night toward Padua
And it is meet I presently set forth
DUKE OF VENICE I am sorry that your leisure serves you not
Antonio gratify this gentleman
For in my mind you are much bound to him
Exeunt DUKE MAGNIFICOES and train
BASSANIO Most worthy gentleman I and my friend
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof
Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew
We freely cope your courteous pains withal
ANTONIO And stand indebted over and above
In love and service to you evermore
PORTIA He is well paid that is well satisfied
And I delivering you am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid
My mind was never yet more mercenary
I pray you know me when we meet again
I wish you well and so I take my leave
BASSANIO Dear sir of force I must attempt you further
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute
Not as fee Grant me two things I pray you
Not to deny me and to pardon me
PORTIA You press me far and therefore I will yield
And you in love shall not deny me this
I will not shame myself to give you this
PORTIA I will have nothing else but only this
And now methinks I have a mind to it
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you
And find it out by proclamation
Only for this I pray you pardon me
PORTIA I see sir you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg and now methinks
BASSANIO Good sir this ring was given me by my wife
And when she put it on she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it
And if your wife be not a mad woman
She would not hold out enemy for ever
For giving it to me Well peace be with you
Exeunt PORTIA and NERISSA
ANTONIO My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring
Let his deservings and my love withal
BASSANIO Go Gratiano run and overtake him
Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst
Come you and I will thither presently
And in the morning early will we both
Fly toward Belmont Come Antonio                    Exeunt
SCENE II
Venice A street
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
And be a day before our husbands home
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo
Enter GRATIANO
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat
Your company at dinner
PORTIA That cannot be
His ring I do accept most thankfully
And so I pray you tell him Furthermore
GRATIANO That will I do
NERISSA Sir I would speak with you
Which I did make him swear to keep for ever
swearing
That they did give the rings away to men
NERISSA Come good sir will you show me to this house
Exeunt
ACT V SCENE I
Enter LORENZO and JESSICA
LORENZO The moon shines bright In such a night as this
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
Where Cressid lay that night
JESSICA In such a night
And ran dismayed away
LORENZO In such a night
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
To come again to Carthage
JESSICA In such a night
Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
That did renew old AEson
LORENZO In such a night
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
As far as Belmont
JESSICA In such a night
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
LORENZO In such a night
Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew
Slander her love and he forgave it her
But hark I hear the footing of a man
Enter STEPHANO
LORENZO Who comes so fast in silence of the night
STEPHANO A friend
LORENZO A friend What friend Your name I pray you friend
STEPHANO Stephano is my name and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont she doth stray about
By holy crosses where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours
LORENZO Who comes with her
STEPHANO None but a holy hermit and her maid
LORENZO He is not nor we have not heard from him
But go we in I pray thee Jessica
And ceremoniously let us prepare
Some welcome for the mistress of the house
Enter LAUNCELOT
LAUNCELOT Sola sola wo ha ho sola sola
LORENZO Who calls
LAUNCELOT Sola Did you see Master Lorenzo Master Lorenzo Sola
sola
LORENZO Leave holloaing man Here
LAUNCELOT Sola Where where
LORENZO Here
horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning
Exit
My friend Stephano signify I pray you
Within the house your mistress is at hand
And bring your music forth into the air       Exit STEPHANO
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony
Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold
But in his motion like an angel sings
Such harmony is in immortal souls
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it
Enter MUSICIANS
Come ho and wake Diana with a hymn
JESSICA I am never merry when I hear sweet music
LORENZO The reason is your spirits are attentive
For do but note a wild and wanton herd
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts
Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
Or any air of music touch their ears
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand
By the sweet power of music Therefore the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods
Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage
But music for the time doth change his nature
The man that hath no music in himself
Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils
The motions of his spirit are dullas night
And his affections dark as Erebus
Let no such man be trusted Mark the music
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA
PORTIA That light we see is burning in my hall
How far that little candle throws his beams
So shines a good deed in a naughty world
NERISSA When the moon shone we did not see the candle
PORTIA So doth the greater glory dim the less
A substitute shines brightly as a king
Until a king be by and then his state
Empties itself as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters Music hark
NERISSA It is your music madam of the house
PORTIA Nothing is good I see without respect
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day
NERISSA Silence bestows that virtue on it madam
PORTIA The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
When neither is attended and I think
ne nightingale if she should sing by day
When every goose is cackling would be thought
No better a musician than the wren
To their right praise and true perfection
Peace ho The moon sleeps with Endymion
LORENZO That is the voice
PORTIA He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo
By the bad voice
LORENZO Dear lady welcome home
Which speed we hope the better for our words
LORENZO Madam they are not yet
But there is come a messenger before
To signify their coming
PORTIA Go in Nerissa
Give order to my servants that they take
No note at all of our being absent hence
LORENZO Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet
PORTIA This night methinks is but the daylight sick
Such as the day is when the sun is hid
Enter BASSANIO ANTONIO GRATIANO and their followers
BASSANIO We should hold day with the Antipodes
If you would walk in absence of the sun
PORTIA Let me give light but let me not be light
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband
And never be Bassanio so for me
But God sort all You are welcome home my lord
BASSANIO I thank you madam give welcome to my friend
This is the man this is Antonio
To whom I am so infinitely bound
PORTIA You should in all sense be much bound to him
For as I hear he was much bound for you
ANTONIO No more than I am well acquitted of
PORTIA Sir you are very welcome to our house
It must appear in other ways than words
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy
Would he were gelt that had it for my part
Since you do take it love so much at heart
GRATIANO About a hoop of gold a paltry ring
That she did give me whose posy was
NERISSA What talk you of the posy or the value
You swore to me when I did give it you
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave
Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths
You should have been respective and have kept it
GRATIANO He will an if he live to be a man
NERISSA Ay if a woman live to be a man
GRATIANO Now by this hand I gave it to a youth
A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy
I could not for my heart deny it him
PORTIA You were to blame I must be plain with you
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it and here he stands
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth
That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief
And swear I lost the ring defending it
GRATIANO My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings
PORTIA What ring gave you my lord
BASSANIO If I could add a lie unto a fault
I would deny it but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it it is gone
PORTIA Even so void is your false heart of truth
Until I see the ring
NERISSA Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine
BASSANIO Sweet Portia
If you did know to whom I gave the ring
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring
When nought would be accepted but the ring
You would abate the strength of your displeasure
PORTIA If you had known the virtue of the ring
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring
Or your own honour to contain the ring
You would not then have parted with the ring
What man is there so much unreasonable
With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony
Nerissa teaches me what to believe
BASSANIO No by my honour madam by my soul
No woman had it but a civil doctor
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
Even he that had held up the very life
Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady
I was beset with shame and courtesy
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it Pardon me good lady
For by these blessed candles of the night
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved
And that which you did swear to keep for me
I will become as liberal as you
Know him I shall I am well sure of it
Lie not a night from home watch me like Argus
If you do not if I be left alone
Now by mine honour which is yet mine own
How you do leave me to mine own protection
GRATIANO Well do you so let not me take him then
PORTIA Sir grieve not you you are welcome not withstanding
BASSANIO Portia forgive me this enforced wrong
And in the hearing of these many friends
I swear to thee even by thine own fair eyes
PORTIA Mark you but that
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself
In each eye one swear by your double self
BASSANIO Nay but hear me
Pardon this fault and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee
ANTONIO I once did lend my body for his wealth
Had quite miscarried I dare be bound again
My soul upon the forfeit that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly
PORTIA Then you shall be his surety Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other
ANTONIO Here Lord Bassanio swear to keep this ring
BASSANIO By heaven it is the same I gave the doctor
PORTIA I had it of him Pardon me Bassanio
For by this ring the doctor lay with me
NERISSA And pardon me my gentle Gratiano
In lieu of this last night did lie with me
GRATIANO Why this is like the mending of highways
In summer where the ways are fair enough
Here is a letter read it at your leisure
It comes from Padua from Bellario
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor
Nerissa there her clerk Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect Unseal this letter soon
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbour suddenly
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter
ANTONIO I am dumb
BASSANIO Were you the doctor and I knew you not
GRATIANO Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold
NERISSA Ay but the clerk that never means to do it
Unless he live until he be a man
BASSANIO Sweet doctor you shall be my bedfellow
When I am absent then lie with my wife
ANTONIO Sweet lady you have given me life and living
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road
PORTIA How now Lorenzo
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you
There do I give to you and Jessica
From the rich Jew a special deed of gift
LORENZO Fair ladies you drop manna in the way
Of starved people
PORTIA It is almost morning
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full Let us go in
And we will answer all things faithfully
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is
Whether till the next night she had rather stay
Or go to bed now being two hours to day
But were the day come I should wish it dark

desire better sympathy Let it suffice thee Mistress Page

Thine own true knight

For thee to fight

gentry
MRS FORD We burn daylight Here read read perceive
how I might be knighted I shall think the worse of fat
to all uncomeliness that I would have sworn his disposition
would have gone to the truth of his words but they do no
more adhere and keep place together than the Hundredth
threw this whale with so many tuns of oil in his belly
ashore at Windsor How shall I be revenged on him I
think the best way were to entertain him with hope till
the wicked fire of lust have melted him in his own grease
Did you ever hear the like
MRS PAGE Letter for letter but that the name of Page and
Ford differs To thy great comfort in this mystery of ill
inherit first for I protest mine never shall I warrant he
hath a thousand of these letters writ with blank space for
edition He will print them out of doubt for he cares not
what he puts into the press when he would put us two I
had rather be a giantess and lie under Mount Pelion Well
I will find you twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste
man
MRS FORD Why this is the very same the very hand the
very words What doth he think of us
MRS PAGE Nay I know not it makes me almost ready to
one that I am not acquainted withal for sure unless he
know some strain in me that I know not myself he would
never have boarded me in this fury
above deck
meeting give him a show of comfort in his suit and lead
horses to mine host of the Garter
MRS FORD Nay I will consent to act any villainy against
him that may not sully the chariness of our honesty O
that my husband saw this letter It would give eternal food
to his jealousy
MRS PAGE Why look where he comes and my good man
cause and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance

FORD Were they his men

FORD I like it never the better for that Does he lie at the
Garter
PAGE Ay marry does he If he should intend this voyage
toward my wife I would turn her loose to him and what
he gets more of her than sharp words let it lie on my head
FORD I do not misdoubt my wife but I would be loath to
turn them together A man may be too confident I would
have nothing lie on my head I cannot be thus satisfied

yourself know how easy is it to be such an offender

much on her followed her with a doting observance
that could but niggardly give me sight of her not
only bought many presents to give her but have given
largely to many to know what she would have given
hath been on the wing of all occasions But whatsoever I
have merited either in my mind or in my means meed I
am sure I have received none unless experience be a jewel
that I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath
taught me to say this
her hands
FORD Never
FORD Never
FALSTAFF Of what quality was your love then
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where
erected it
FALSTAFF To what purpose have you unfolded this to me
FORD When I have told you that I have told you all Some
say that though she appear honest to me yet in other
places she enlargeth her mirth so far that there is shrewd
construction made of her Now Sir John here is the heart
of my purpose you are a gentleman of excellent
breeding admirable discourse of great admittance authentic in
FALSTAFF O sir
FORD Believe it for you know it There is money spend it
spend it spend more spend all I have only give me so
much of your time in exchange of it as to lay an amiable
wooing win her to consent to you if any man may you
may as soon as any
FALSTAFF Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enjoy
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously
FORD O understand my drift She dwells so securely on the
excellency of her honour that the folly of my soul dares
Now could I come to her with any detection in my hand
my desires had instance and argument to commend themselves
I could drive her then from the ward of her purity
her reputation her marriage vow and a thousand other her
FALSTAFF Master Brook I will first make bold with your
money next give me your hand and last as I am a gentleman
FORD O good sir
FALSTAFF I say you shall
FORD Want no money Sir John you shall want none

want none I shall be with her I may tell you by her own

peasant and thou shalt lie with his wife Come to me soon at
Master Brook shalt know him for knave and cuckold
Come to me soon at night                               Exit

the match is made Would any man have thought this See
not only receive this villainous wrong but stand under the
adoption of abominable terms and by him that does me
this wrong Terms names Amaimon sounds well Lucifer

hath not such a name Page is an ass a secure ass he will trust
his wife he will not be jealous I will rather trust a Fleming

MRS PAGE Within a quarter of an hour
FORD Pardon me wife Henceforth do what thou wilt

Than thee with wantonness Now doth thy honour stand
In him that was of late an heretic
As firm as faith
Be not as extreme in submission as in offence
But let our plot go forward Let our wives
Yet once again to make us public sport
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it
FORD There is no better way than that they spoke of
EVANS You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
been grievously peaten as an old oman methinks there
should be terrors in him that he should not come
PAGE So think I too
And let us two devise to bring him thither
MRS PAGE There is an old tale goes that Heme the Hunter
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor Forest
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
In a most hideous and dreadful manner
You have heard of such a spirit and well you know
This tale of Heme the Hunter for a truth
PAGE Why yet there want not many that do fear
But what of this
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us
And in this shape When you have brought him thither
What shall be done with him What is your plot
MRS PAGE That likewise have we thought upon and
thus
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
Like urchins ouphes and fairies green and white
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads
And rattles in their hands upon a sudden
As Falstaff she and I are newly met
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song upon their sight
We two in great amazedness will fly
Then let them all encircle him about
And ask him why that hour of fairy revel
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane
MRS FORD And till he tell the truth
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers
MRS PAGE The truth being known
And mock him home to Windsor
FORD The children must
EVANS I will teach the children their behaviours and I will
taber

Immediately to marry she hath consented
Now sir
Her mother even strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away
While other sports are tasking of their minds
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor Now thus it rests
Her father means she shall be all in white
And in that habit when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go
She shall go with him her mother hath intended
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
To pinch her by the hand and on that token
The maid hath given consent to go with him
HOST Which means she to deceive father or mother
FENTON Both my good host to go along with me
And in the lawful name of marrying
To give our hearts united ceremony
Bring you the maid you shall not lack a priest
FENTON So shall I evermore be bound to thee

Cricket to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry
Our radiant Queen hates sluts and sluttery

Raise up the organs of her fantasy

FAIRY QUEEN About about
Search Windsor castle elves within and out
Strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room
That it may stand till the perpetual doom
Worthy the owner and the owner it
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower
With loyal blazon evermore be blest
Like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the Hunter let us not forget
EVANS Pray you lock hand in hand yourselves in order set
To guide our measure round about the tree
But stay I smell a man of middle earth
FALSTAFF Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy lest he
transform me to a piece of cheese

And turn him to no pain but if he start
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart
PUCK A trial come
EVANS Come will this wood take fire
FALSTAFF Oh oh oh
FAIRY QUEEN Corrupt corrupt and tainted in desire
About him fairies sing a scornful rhyme
And as you trip still pinch him to your time
THE SONG
Fie on sinful fantasy
Fie on lust and luxury
Lust is but a bloody fire
Kindled with unchaste desire
Fed in heart whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them higher and higher
Pinch him fairies mutually
Pinch him for his villainy
Pinch him and burn him and turn him about
During this song they pinch FALSTAFF DOCTOR

green SLENDER another way and takes off a fairy in
white and FENTON steals away ANNE PAGE A noise

times in the thought they were not fairies and yet the
guiltiness of my mind the sudden surprise of my powers

FORD Well said fairy Hugh
EVANS And leave you your jealousies too I pray you

toasted cheese
EVANS Seese is not good to give putter your belly is all

ANNE Pardon good father Good my mother pardon
PAGE Now Mistress how chance you went not with Master
Slender
MRS PAGE Why went you not with Master Doctor maid
FENTON You do amaze her Hear the truth of it
You would have married her most shamefully
Where there was no proportion held in love
The truth is she and I long since contracted
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us
And this deceit loses the name of craft
Of disobedience or unduteous title
Since therein she doth evitate and shun
A thousand irreligious cursed hours
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state
Money buys lands and wives are sold by fate
PAGE Well what remedy Fenton heaven give thee joy
MRS PAGE Well I will muse no further Master Fenton
Heaven give you many many merry days
Good husband let us every one go home
Sir John and all
FORD Let it be so Sir John
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word

SCENE
Athens and a wood near it
ACT I SCENE I
Athens The palace of THESEUS
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE and ATTENDANTS
THESEUS Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour
Draws on apace four happy days bring in
Another moon but O methinks how slow
This old moon wanes She lingers my desires
HIPPOLYTA Four days will quickly steep themselves in night
Four nights will quickly dream away the time
And then the moon like to a silver bow
Of our solemnities
THESEUS Go Philostrate
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth
Turn melancholy forth to funerals
The pale companion is not for our pomp     Exit PHILOSTRATE
And won thy love doing thee injuries
But I will wed thee in another key
With pomp with triumph and with revelling
Enter EGEUS and his daughter HERMIA LYSANDER
and DEMETRIUS
EGEUS Happy be Theseus our renowned Duke
EGEUS Full of vexation come I with complaint
Against my child my daughter Hermia
Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord
This man hath my consent to marry her
Stand forth Lysander And my gracious Duke
Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
With feigning voice verses of feigning love
With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits
Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth
To stubborn harshness And my gracious Duke
Be it so she will not here before your Grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens
As she is mine I may dispose of her
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death according to our law
Immediately provided in that case
To you your father should be as a god
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman
HERMIA So is Lysander
THESEUS In himself he is
The other must be held the worthier
THESEUS Rather your eyes must with his judgment look
HERMIA I do entreat your Grace to pardon me
I know not by what power I am made bold
Nor how it may concern my modesty
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts
But I beseech your Grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case
If I refuse to wed Demetrius
THESEUS Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men
Therefore fair Hermia question your desires
Know of your youth examine well your blood
You can endure the livery of a nun
To live a barren sister all your life
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows lives and dies in single blessedness
HERMIA So will I grow so live so die my lord
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty
Upon that day either prepare to die
Or else to wed Demetrius as he would
For aye austerity and single life
DEMETRIUS Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right
EGEUS Scornful Lysander true he hath my love
And what is mine my love shall render him
And she is mine and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius
And which is more than all these boasts can be
Why should not I then prosecute my right
And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes
Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry
Upon this spotted and inconstant man
THESEUS I must confess that I have heard so much
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof
My mind did lose it But Demetrius come
And come Egeus you shall go with me
I have some private schooling for you both
For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself
To death or to a vow of single life
Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love
Demetrius and Egeus go along
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves
EGEUS With duty and desire we follow you
Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA
LYSANDER How now my love Why is your cheek so pale
How chance the roses there do fade so fast
HERMIA Belike for want of rain which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes
LYSANDER Ay me for aught that I could ever read
Could ever hear by tale or history
The course of true love never did run smooth
LYSANDER Or if there were a sympathy in choice
War death or sickness did lay siege to it
Making it momentary as a sound
Swift as a shadow short as any dream
Brief as the lightning in the collied night
That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth
The jaws of darkness do devour it up
So quick bright things come to confusion
It stands as an edict in destiny
Then let us teach our trial patience
Because it is a customary cross
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs
LYSANDER A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia
I have a widow aunt a dowager
And she respects me as her only son
There gentle Hermia may I marry thee
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us If thou lovest me then
And in the wood a league without the town
Where I did meet thee once with Helena
To do observance to a morn of May
There will I stay for thee
HERMIA My good Lysander
By his best arrow with the golden head
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves
When the false Troyan under sail was seen
By all the vows that ever men have broke
In number more than ever women spoke
In that same place thou hast appointed me
LYSANDER Keep promise love Look here comes Helena
Enter HELENA
HERMIA God speed fair Helena Whither away
HELENA Call you me fair That fair again unsay
Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair
When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear
Sickness is catching O were favour so
Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go
My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye
Were the world mine Demetrius being bated
O teach me how you look and with what art
HERMIA I frown upon him yet he loves me still
HELENA O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill
HERMIA I give him curses yet he gives me love
HELENA O that my prayers could such affection move
HERMIA The more I hate the more he follows me
HELENA The more I love the more he hateth me
HERMIA His folly Helena is no fault of mine
HELENA None but your beauty would that fault were mine
HERMIA Take comfort he no more shall see my face
Lysander and myself will fly this place
Before the time I did Lysander see
O then what graces in my love do dwell
LYSANDER Helen to you our minds we will unfold
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
HERMIA And in the wood where often you and I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet
There my Lysander and myself shall meet
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes
To seek new friends and stranger companies
Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius
Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight
As you on him Demetrius dote on you                   Exit
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she
But what of that Demetrius thinks not so
He will not know what all but he do know
So I admiring of his qualities
Things base and vile holding no quantity
Love can transpose to form and dignity
Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste
And therefore is Love said to be a child
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt
Pursue her and for this intelligence
If I have thanks it is a dear expense
But herein mean I to enrich my pain
To have his sight thither and back again               Exit
SCENE II

ACT II SCENE I
A wood near Athens
Enter a FAIRY at One door and PUCK at another
PUCK How now spirit whither wander you
FAIRY      Over hill over dale
Thorough bush thorough brier
Over park over pale
Thorough flood thorough fire
I do wander every where
And I serve the Fairy Queen
To dew her orbs upon the green
The cowslips tall her pensioners be
In their gold coats spots you see
Those be rubies fairy favours
In those freckles live their savours
I must go seek some dewdrops here
Our Queen and all her elves come here anon
Take heed the Queen come not within his sight
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king
She never had so sweet a changeling
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train to trace the forests wild
But she perforce withholds the loved boy
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy
And now they never meet in grove or green
By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen
But they do square that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn cups and hide them there
FAIRY Either I mistake your shape and making quite
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
That frights the maidens of the villagery
Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck
You do their work and they shall have good luck
Are not you he
PUCK Thou speakest aright
I am that merry wanderer of the night
I jest to Oberon and make him smile
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal
In very likeness of a roasted crab
And when she drinks against her lips I bob
And on her withered dewlap pour the ale
The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale
Then slip I from her bum down topples she
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there
But room fairy here comes Oberon
FAIRY And here my mistress Would that he were gone
Enter OBERON at one door with his TRAIN and TITANIA
at another with hers
OBERON Ill met by moonlight proud Titania
TITANIA What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence
I have forsworn his bed and company
OBERON Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord
TITANIA Then I must be thy lady but I know
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land
And in the shape of Corin sat all day
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
To amorous Phillida Why art thou here
Come from the farthest steep of India
But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon
To Theseus must be wedded and you come
To give their bed joy and prosperity
OBERON How canst thou thus for shame Titania
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus
Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
From Perigouna whom he ravished
And make him with fair Aegles break his faith
With Ariadne and Antiopa
TITANIA These are the forgeries of jealousy
Met we on hill in dale forest or mead
By paved fountain or by rushy brook
Or in the beached margent of the sea
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind
Therefore the winds piping to us in vain
Contagious fogs which falling in the land
Hath every pelting river made so proud
That they have overborne their continents
The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn
The fold stands empty in the drowned field
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable
The human mortals want their winter here
No night is now with hymn or carol blest
Therefore the moon the governess of floods
Pale in her anger washes all the air
That rheumatic diseases do abound
And thorough this distemperature we see
Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is as in mockery set The spring the summer
The childing autumn angry winter change
Their wonted liveries and the mazed world
By their increase now knows not which is which
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate from our dissension
We are their parents and original
OBERON Do you amend it then it lies in you
Why should Titania cross her Oberon
I do but beg a little changeling boy
To be my henchman
TITANIA Set your heart at rest
The fairy land buys not the child of me
And in the spiced Indian air by night
Which she with pretty and with swimming gait
Would imitate and sail upon the land
To fetch me trifles and return again
As from a voyage rich with merchandise
But she being mortal of that boy did die
And for her sake do I rear up her boy
And for her sake I will not part with him
OBERON How long within this wood intend you stay
If you will patiently dance in our round
And see our moonlight revels go with us
If not shun me and I will spare your haunts
OBERON Give me that boy and I will go with thee
TITANIA Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away
We shall chide downright if I longer stay
Exit TITANIA with her train
OBERON Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove
Till I torment thee for this injury
Since once I sat upon a promontory
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
PUCK I remember
OBERON That very time I saw but thou couldst not
Flying between the cold moon and the earth
At a fair vestal throned by the west
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts
It fell upon a little western flower
The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees
Fetch me this herb and be thou here again
Ere the leviathan can swim a league
In forty minutes                                  Exit PUCK
OBERON Having once this juice
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes
The next thing then she waking looks upon
Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull
On meddling monkey or on busy ape
She shall pursue it with the soul of love
And ere I take this charm from off her sight
As I can take it with another herb
But who comes here I am invisible
And I will overhear their conference
Enter DEMETRIUS HELENA following him
DEMETRIUS I love thee not therefore pursue me not
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia
And here am I and wood within this wood
Because I cannot meet my Hermia
Hence get thee gone and follow me no more
But yet you draw not iron for my heart
Is true as steel Leave you your power to draw
And I shall have no power to follow you
DEMETRIUS Do I entice you Do I speak you fair
Or rather do I not in plainest truth
Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you
HELENA And even for that do I love you the more
I am your spaniel and Demetrius
The more you beat me I will fawn on you
Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me
Neglect me lose me only give me leave
Unworthy as I am to follow you
What worser place can I beg in your love
And yet a place of high respect with me
Than to be used as you use your dog
DEMETRIUS Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit
For I am sick when I do look on thee
HELENA And I am sick when I look not on you
DEMETRIUS You do impeach your modesty too much
To leave the city and commit yourself
Into the hands of one that loves you not
To trust the opportunity of night
And the ill counsel of a desert place
With the rich worth of your virginity
HELENA Your virtue is my privilege for that
It is not night when I do see your face
Therefore I think I am not in the night
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company
For you in my respect are all the world
Then how can it be said I am alone
When all the world is here to look on me
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts
HELENA The wildest hath not such a heart as you
Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase
The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind
When cowardice pursues and valour flies
DEMETRIUS I will not stay thy questions let me go
Or if thou follow me do not believe
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood
HELENA Ay in the temple in the town the field
You do me mischief Fie Demetrius
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex
We cannot fight for love as men may do
Exit DEMETRIUS
To die upon the hand I love so well             Exit HELENA
OBERON Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove
Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love
Hast thou the flower there Welcome wanderer
PUCK Ay there it is
OBERON I pray thee give it me
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in
And make her full of hateful fantasies
Take thou some of it and seek through this grove
A sweet Athenian lady is in love
With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes
But do it when the next thing he espies
May be the lady Thou shalt know the man
By the Athenian garments he hath on
Effect it with some care that he may prove
More fond on her than she upon her love
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow
PUCK Fear not my lord your servant shall do so      Exeunt
SCENE II
Another part of the wood
Enter TITANIA with her train
TITANIA Come now a roundel and a fairy song
Then for the third part of a minute hence
To make my small elves coats and some keep back
The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep
Then to your offices and let me rest
The FAIRIES Sing
FIRST FAIRY You spotted snakes with double tongue
Thorny hedgehogs be not seen
Come not near our fairy Queen
CHORUS      Philomel with melody
Sing in our sweet lullaby
Lulla lulla lullaby lulla lulla lullaby
Never harm
Nor spell nor charm
Come our lovely lady nigh
So good night with lullaby
SECOND FAIRY  Weaving spiders come not here
Beetles black approach not near
Worm nor snail do no offence
FIRST FAIRY Hence away now all is well
One aloof stand sentinel          Exeunt FAIRIES
OBERON What thou seest when thou dost wake
Love and languish for his sake
Be it ounce or cat or bear
Pard or boar with bristled hair
In thy eye that shall appear
Wake when some vile thing is near                      Exit
Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA
And to speak troth I have forgot our way
And tarry for the comfort of the day
HERMIA Be it so Lysander find you out a bed
For I upon this bank will rest my head
LYSANDER One turf shall serve as pillow for us both
One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth
HERMIA Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear
Lie further off yet do not lie so near
LYSANDER O take the sense sweet of my innocence
I mean that my heart unto yours is knit
So that but one heart we can make of it
Two bosoms interchained with an oath
So then two bosoms and a single troth
For lying so Hermia I do not lie
HERMIA Lysander riddles very prettily
Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied
But gentle friend for love and courtesy
Lie further off in human modesty
Such separation as may well be said
Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid
So far be distant and good night sweet friend
LYSANDER Amen amen to that fair prayer say I
And then end life when I end loyalty
Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest
Enter PUCK
PUCK      Through the forest have I gone
But Athenian found I none
On whose eyes I might approve
Weeds of Athens he doth wear
This is he my master said
Despised the Athenian maid
And here the maiden sleeping sound
On the dank and dirty ground
Pretty soul she durst not lie
Churl upon thy eyes I throw
All the power this charm doth owe
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid
So awake when I am gone
For I must now to Oberon                      Exit
Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA running
HELENA Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius
DEMETRIUS I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus
HELENA O wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so
DEMETRIUS Stay on thy peril I alone will go            Exit
HELENA O I am out of breath in this fond chase
The more my prayer the lesser is my grace
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes
How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears
No no I am as ugly as a bear
For beasts that meet me run away for fear
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
Do as a monster fly my presence thus
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
But who is here Lysander on the ground
Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound
Lysander if you live good sir awake
Transparent Helena Nature shows art
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart
Where is Demetrius O how fit a word
Is that vile name to perish on my sword
HELENA Do not say so Lysander say not so
What though he love your Hermia Lord what though
Yet Hermia still loves you then be content
LYSANDER Content with Hermia No I do repent
The tedious minutes I with her have spent
Not Hermia but Helena I love
Who will not change a raven for a dove
And reason says you are the worthier maid
Things growing are not ripe until their season
So I being young till now ripe not to reason
And touching now the point of human skill
Reason becomes the marshal to my will
HELENA Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn
That I did never no nor never can
But you must flout my insufficiency
Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do
In such disdainful manner me to woo
But fare you well perforce I must confess
I thought you lord of more true gentleness
LYSANDER She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there
And never mayst thou come Lysander near
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings
Or as the heresies that men do leave
Are hated most of those they did deceive
So thou my surfeit and my heresy
Of all be hated but the most of me
And all my powers address your love and might
To honour Helen and to be her knight                  Exit
To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast
Ay me for pity What a dream was here
Lysander look how I do quake with fear
Methought a serpent eat my heart away
And you sat smiling at his cruel prey
What out of hearing gone No sound no word
Alack where are you Speak an if you hear
Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear
No Then I well perceive you are not nigh

STARVELING I believe we must leave the killing out when all is
done
BOTTOM Not a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a
prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm

QUINCE Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written
in eight and six
BOTTOM No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight
SNOUT Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion

QUINCE Yes it doth shine that night
BOTTOM Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber
window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the
casement
QUINCE Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person
of Moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in
the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did
talk through the chink of a wall
SNOUT You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom

shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper
QUINCE If that may be then all is well Come sit down every

FLUTE Must I speak now
QUINCE Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to

BOTTOM If I were fair Thisby I were only thine
QUINCE O monstrous O strange We are haunted Pray masters fly

Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn
Exit
BOTTOM Why do they run away This is a knavery of them to make me
afeard
Exit SNOUT
QUINCE Bless thee Bottom bless thee Thou art translated
Exit
BOTTOM I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to
fright me if they could But I will not stir from this place do
what they can I will walk up and down here and will sing that
The ousel cock so black of hue
The throstle with his note so true
The wren with little quill
The finch the sparrow and the lark
Whose note full many a man doth mark
for indeed who would set his wit to so foolish a bird
TITANIA I pray thee gentle mortal sing again
Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note
So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape
On the first view to say to swear I love thee
BOTTOM Methinks mistress you should have little reason for that
And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company
neighbours will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon
occasion
TITANIA Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful
BOTTOM Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this
wood I have enough to serve mine own turn
TITANIA Out of this wood do not desire to go
Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no
I am a spirit of no common rate
The summer still doth tend upon my state
And I do love thee therefore go with me
And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep
And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
That thou shalt like an airy spirit go
Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed
Enter PEASEBLOSSOM COBWEB MOTH and MUSTARDSEED
PEASEBLOSSOM Ready
COBWEB And I
MOTH And I
MUSTARDSEED And I
ALL Where shall we go
TITANIA Be kind and courteous to this gentleman
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes
Feed him with apricocks and dewberries
With purple grapes green figs and mulberries
To have my love to bed and to arise
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes
Nod to him elves and do him courtesies
PEASEBLOSSOM Hail mortal
COBWEB Hail

ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master
Mustardseed
TITANIA Come wait upon him lead him to my bower
And when she weeps weeps every little flower
Lamenting some enforced chastity
SCENE II
Another part of the wood
Enter OBERON
Then what it was that next came in her eye
Which she must dote on in extremity
Enter PUCK
Here comes my messenger How now mad spirit
PUCK My mistress with a monster is in love
Near to her close and consecrated bower
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour
A crew of patches rude mechanicals
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls
Were met together to rehearse a play
The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
Who Pyramus presented in their sport
When I did him at this advantage take
Anon his Thisby must be answered
And forth my mimic comes When they him spy
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky
So at his sight away his fellows fly
He murder cries and help from Athens calls
Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch
Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch
I led them on in this distracted fear
And left sweet Pyramus translated there
When in that moment so it came to pass
OBERON This falls out better than I could devise
And the Athenian woman by his side
Enter DEMETRIUS and HERMIA
OBERON Stand close this is the same Athenian
PUCK This is the woman but not this the man
DEMETRIUS O why rebuke you him that loves you so
Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe
HERMIA Now I but chide but I should use thee worse
For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse
If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep
And kill me too
The sun was not so true unto the day
As he to me Would he have stolen away
May through the centre creep and so displease
DEMETRIUS So should the murdered look and so should I
Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear
As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere
Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me
DEMETRIUS I had rather give his carcass to my hounds
O once tell true tell true even for my sake
Could not a worm an adder do so much
An adder did it for with doubler tongue
Than thine thou serpent never adder stung
Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell
HERMIA I pray thee tell me then that he is well
DEMETRIUS An if I could what should I get therefore
HERMIA A privilege never to see me more
And from thy hated presence part I so
See me no more whether he be dead or no                Exit
DEMETRIUS There is no following her in this fierce vein
Here therefore for a while I will remain
For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe
Which now in some slight measure it will pay
OBERON What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite
Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
A million fail confounding oath on oath
OBERON About the wood go swifter than the wind
And Helena of Athens look thou find
With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear
By some illusion see thou bring her here
PUCK I go I go look how I go
OBERON       Flower of this purple dye
Sink in apple of his eye
When his love he doth espy
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky
Beg of her for remedy
PUCK         Captain of our fairy band
Helena is here at hand
And the youth mistook by me
Shall we their fond pageant see
Lord what fools these mortals be
OBERON       Stand aside The noise they make
Will cause Demetrius to awake
PUCK         Then will two at once woo one
That must needs be sport alone
And those things do best please me
Enter LYSANDER and HELENA
LYSANDER Why should you think that I should woo in scorn
Scorn and derision never come in tears
Look when I vow I weep and vows so born
In their nativity all truth appears
How can these things in me seem scorn to you
Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true
HELENA You do advance your cunning more and more
Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh
Your vows to her and me put in two scales
Will even weigh and both as light as tales
LYSANDER I hod no judgment when to her I swore
LYSANDER Demetrius loves her and he loves not you
To what my love shall I compare thine eyne
Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show
Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow
This princess of pure white this seal of bliss
HELENA O spite O hell I see you all are bent
To set against me for your merriment
If you were civil and knew courtesy
You would not do me thus much injury
Can you not hate me as I know you do
But you must join in souls to mock me too
If you were men as men you are in show
You would not use a gentle lady so
To vow and swear and superpraise my parts
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts
You both are rivals and love Hermia
And now both rivals to mock Helena
A trim exploit a manly enterprise
With your derision None of noble sort
Would so offend a virgin and extort
LYSANDER You are unkind Demetrius be not so
For you love Hermia This you know I know
And here with all good will with all my heart
And yours of Helena to me bequeath
Whom I do love and will do till my death
HELENA Never did mockers waste more idle breath
DEMETRIUS Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none
There to remain
LYSANDER Helen it is not so
DEMETRIUS Disparage not the faith thou dost not know
Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear
Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear
Enter HERMIA
HERMIA Dark night that from the eye his function takes
The ear more quick of apprehension makes
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense
It pays the hearing double recompense
Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found
Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so
LYSANDER Why should he stay whom love doth press to go
HERMIA What love could press Lysander from my side
Fair Helena who more engilds the night
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light
The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so
HERMIA You speak not as you think it cannot be
HELENA Lo she is one of this confederacy
To fashion this false sport in spite of me
Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid
To bait me with this foul derision
We Hermia like two artificial gods
Have with our needles created both one flower
Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion
Both warbling of one song both in one key
As if our hands our sides voices and minds
Had been incorporate So we grew together
Like to a double cherry seeming parted
But yet an union in partition
Two lovely berries moulded on one stern
So with two seeming bodies but one heart
Two of the first like coats in heraldry
Due but to one and crowned with one crest
And will you rent our ancient love asunder
To join with men in scorning your poor friend
Our sex as well as I may chide you for it
Though I alone do feel the injury
HERMIA I am amazed at your passionate words
I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me
HELENA Have you not set Lysander as in scorn
To follow me and praise my eyes and face
And made your other love Demetrius
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot
To call me goddess nymph divine and rare
Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love so rich within his soul
And tender me forsooth affection
But by your setting on by your consent
What though I be not so in grace as you
So hung upon with love so fortunate
This you should pity rather than despise
HERMIA I understand not what you mean by this
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back
Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up
This sport well carried shall be chronicled
If you have any pity grace or manners
You would not make me such an argument
Which death or absence soon shall remedy
LYSANDER Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse
My love my life my soul fair Helena
HELENA O excellent
HERMIA Sweet do not scorn her so
DEMETRIUS If she cannot entreat I can compel
LYSANDER Thou canst compel no more than she entreat
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers
Helen I love thee by my life I do
I swear by that which I will lose for thee
To prove him false that says I love thee not
DEMETRIUS I say I love thee more than he can do
LYSANDER If thou say so withdraw and prove it too
DEMETRIUS Quick come
HERMIA Lysander whereto tends all this
LYSANDER Away you Ethiope
DEMETRIUS No no he will
But yet come not You are a tame man go
LYSANDER Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent
HERMIA Why are you grown so rude What change is this
Sweet love
LYSANDER Thy love Out tawny Tartar out
HERMIA Do you not jest
HELENA Yes sooth and so do you
LYSANDER Demetrius I will keep my word with thee
DEMETRIUS I would I had your bond for I perceive
LYSANDER What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead
HERMIA What Can you do me greater harm than hate
Hate me wherefore O me what news my love
Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander
I am as fair now as I was erewhile
In earnest shall I say
LYSANDER Ay by my life
And never did desire to see thee more
Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt
That I do hate thee and love Helena
HERMIA O me you juggler you cankerblossom
You thief of love What Have you come by night
Have you no modesty no maiden shame
No touch of bashfulness What Will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue
Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
And with her personage her tall personage
And are you grown so high in his esteem
Because I am so dwarfish and so low
How low am I thou painted maypole Speak
How low am I I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes
HELENA I pray you though you mock me gentlemen
Let her not hurt me I was never curst
I have no gift at all in shrewishness
I am a right maid for my cowardice
Let her not strike me You perhaps may think
Because she is something lower than myself
That I can match her
HELENA Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me
I evermore did love you Hermia
Save that in love unto Demetrius
I told him of your stealth unto this wood
He followed you for love I followed him
To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too
And now so you will let me quiet go
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further Let me go
You see how simple and how fond I am
HELENA A foolish heart that I leave here behind
HERMIA What with Lysander
HELENA With Demetrius
LYSANDER Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena
DEMETRIUS No sir she shall not though you take her part
HELENA O when she is angry she is keen and shrewd
She was a vixen when she went to school
And though she be but little she is fierce
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus
Let me come to her
LYSANDER Get you gone you dwarf
You bead you acorn
DEMETRIUS You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services
Let her alone speak not of Helena
Take not her part for if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her
Thou shalt aby it
LYSANDER Now she holds me not
Of thine or mine is most in Helena
Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS
HERMIA You mistress all this coil is long of you
Nay go not back
HELENA I will not trust you I
Nor longer stay in your curst company
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray
My legs are longer though to run away                 Exit
PUCK Believe me king of shadows I mistook
Did not you tell me I should know the man
By the Athenian garments he had on
And so far blameless proves my enterprise
And so far am I glad it so did sort
As this their jangling I esteem a sport
OBERON Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight
Hie therefore Robin overcast the night
The starry welkin cover thou anon
With drooping fog as black as Acheron
And lead these testy rivals so astray
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius
And from each other look thou lead them thus
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property
To take from thence all error with his might
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight
When they next wake all this derision
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
With league whose date till death shall never end
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ
And then I will her charmed eye release
PUCK My fairy lord this must be done with haste
Troop home to churchyards Damned spirits all
Already to their wormy beds are gone
For fear lest day should look their shames upon
OBERON But we are spirits of another sort
And like a forester the groves may tread
Even till the eastern gate all fiery red
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams
But notwithstanding haste make no delay
We may effect this business yet ere day         Exit OBERON
PUCK      Up and down up and down
I will lead them up and down
Goblin lead them up and down
Here comes one
Enter LYSANDER
LYSANDER Where art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now
PUCK Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou
LYSANDER I will be with thee straight
PUCK Follow me then
To plainer ground      Exit LYSANDER as following the voice
Enter DEMETRIUS
DEMETRIUS Lysander speak again
Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled
Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head
PUCK Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars
And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child
That draws a sword on thee
DEMETRIUS Yea art thou there
LYSANDER He goes before me and still dares me on
When I come where he calls then he is gone
I followed fast but faster he did fly
That fallen am I in dark uneven way
For if but once thou show me thy grey light
Where art thou now
PUCK Come hither I am here
If ever I thy face by daylight see
Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me
To measure out my length on this cold bed
Enter HELENA
HELENA O weary night O long and tedious night
Abate thy hours Shine comforts from the east
That I may back to Athens by daylight
From these that my poor company detest
PUCK       Yet but three Come one more
Two of both kinds makes up four
Here she comes curst and sad
Cupid is a knavish lad
Thus to make poor females mad
Enter HERMIA
HERMIA Never so weary never so in woe
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers
I can no further crawl no further go
My legs can keep no pace with my desires
Here will I rest me till the break of day
Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray
PUCK          On the ground
Sleep sound
To your eye
Gentle lover remedy
True delight
In the sight
And the country proverb known
That every man should take his own
In your waking shall be shown
Jack shall have Jill
Nought shall go ill
The man shall have his mare again and all shall be well

sight
Her dotage now I do begin to pity
For meeting her of late behind the wood
Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool
I did upbraid her and fall out with her
For she his hairy temples then had rounded
With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers
And that same dew which sometime on the buds
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail
When I had at my pleasure taunted her
I then did ask of her her changeling child
Which straight she gave me and her fairy sent
To bear him to my bower in fairy land
And now I have the boy I will undo
This hateful imperfection of her eyes
And gentle Puck take this transformed scalp
From off the head of this Athenian swain
That he awaking when the other do
May all to Athens back again repair
But as the fierce vexation of a dream
But first I will release the Fairy Queen
Be as thou wast wont to be
See as thou was wont to see
Hath such force and blessed power
Now my Titania wake you my sweet queen
TITANIA My Oberon What visions have I seen
OBERON There lies your love
TITANIA How came these things to pass
O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now
OBERON Silence awhile Robin take off this head
Titania music call and strike more dead
Than common sleep of all these five the sense
TITANIA Music ho music such as charmeth sleep
OBERON Sound music Come my Queen take hands with me
And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be
Now thou and I are new in amity
And bless it to all fair prosperity
There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
Wedded with Theseus an in jollity
PUCK       Fairy King attend and mark
I do hear the morning lark
OBERON     Then my Queen in silence sad
We the globe can compass soon
TITANIA    Come my lord and in our flight
Tell me how it came this night
That I sleeping here was found
With these mortals on the ground           Exeunt
To the winding of horns enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA
EGEUS and train
THESEUS Go one of you find out the forester
And since we have the vaward of the day
My love shall hear the music of my hounds
Uncouple in the western valley let them go
Dispatch I say and find the forester    Exit an ATTENDANT
And mark the musical confusion
Of hounds and echo in conjunction
HIPPOLYTA I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
With hounds of Sparta never did I hear
Such gallant chiding for besides the groves
The skies the fountains every region near
So musical a discord such sweet thunder
THESEUS My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind
With ears that sweep away the morning dew
Each under each A cry more tuneable
In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly
Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these
EGEUS My lord this is my daughter here asleep
And this Lysander this Demetrius is
I wonder of their being here together
THESEUS No doubt they rose up early to observe
The rite of May and hearing our intent
Came here in grace of our solemnity
But speak Egeus is not this the day
That Hermia should give answer of her choice
EGEUS It is my lord
THESEUS Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns
LYSANDER Pardon my lord
THESEUS I pray you all stand up
I know you two are rival enemies
How comes this gentle concord in the world
That hatred is so far from jealousy
To sleep by hate and fear no enmity
LYSANDER My lord I shall reply amazedly
Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear
I cannot truly say how I came here
I came with Hermia hither Our intent
Was to be gone from Athens where we might
EGEUS Enough enough my Lord you have enough
I beg the law the law upon his head
Thereby to have defeated you and me
You of your wife and me of my consent
Of my consent that she should be your wife
DEMETRIUS My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth
Of this their purpose hither to this wood
And I in fury hither followed them
Fair Helena in fancy following me
Melted as the snow seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon
And all the faith the virtue of my heart
The object and the pleasure of mine eye
Is only Helena To her my lord
But like a sickness did I loathe this food
But as in health come to my natural taste
Now I do wish it love it long for it
And will for evermore be true to it
THESEUS Fair lovers you are fortunately met
Of this discourse we more will hear anon
Egeus I will overbear your will
For in the temple by and by with us
These couples shall eternally be knit
And for the morning now is something worn
Away with us to Athens three and three
Come Hippolyta
Exeunt THESEUS HIPPOLYTA EGEUS and train
DEMETRIUS These things seem small and undistinguishable
HERMIA Methinks I see these things with parted eye
When every thing seems double
HELENA So methinks
And I have found Demetrius like a jewel
Mine own and not mine own
DEMETRIUS Are you sure
That we are awake It seems to me
That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think
The Duke was here and bid us follow him
HERMIA Yea and my father
HELENA And Hippolyta
LYSANDER And he did bid us follow to the temple
And by the way let us recount our dreams             Exeunt
I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was
Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought
to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard the
tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I
will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream It shall
sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke
Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at
her death                                              Exit
SCENE II
Enter QUINCE FLUTE SNOUT and STARVELING
STARVELING He cannot be heard of Out of doubt he is transported
forward doth it
QUINCE It is not possible You have not a man in all Athens able
to discharge Pyramus but he
FLUTE No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in
Athens
QUINCE Yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for
a sweet voice
thing of naught
Enter SNUG
SNUG Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is two
or three lords and ladies more married If our sport had gone
forward we had all been made men
FLUTE O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day
during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day An the
be hanged He would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus
or nothing
Enter BOTTOM
BOTTOM Where are these lads Where are these hearts
QUINCE Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour
BOTTOM Masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what
for if I tell you I am not true Athenian I will tell you
everything right as it fell out
QUINCE Let us hear sweet Bottom
BOTTOM Not a word of me All that I will tell you is that the
Duke hath dined Get your apparel together good strings to your
beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace
let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall
onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not
doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words
Away go away                                       Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Athens The palace of THESEUS
Enter THESEUS HIPPOLYTA PHILOSTRATE LORDS and ATTENDANTS
THESEUS More strange than true I never may believe
These antique fables nor these fairy toys
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains
Such shaping fantasies that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends
The lunatic the lover and the poet
Are of imagination all compact
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold
That is the madman The lover all as frantic
Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven
And as imagination bodies forth
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name
Such tricks hath strong imagination
That if it would but apprehend some joy
It comprehends some bringer of that joy
Or in the night imagining some fear
HIPPOLYTA But all the story of the night told over
And grows to something of great constancy
But howsoever strange and admirable
Enter LYSANDER DEMETRIUS HERMIA and HELENA
THESEUS Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth
Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love
Accompany your hearts
LYSANDER More than to us
Wait in your royal walks your board your bed
THESEUS Come now what masques what dances shall we have
To wear away this long age of three hours
Where is our usual manager of mirth
What revels are in hand Is there no play
To ease the anguish of a torturing hour
Call Philostrate
PHILOSTRATE Here mighty Theseus
THESEUS Say what abridgment have you for this evening
What masque what music How shall we beguile
The lazy time if not with some delight
PHILOSTRATE There is a brief how many sports are ripe
Make choice of which your Highness will see first
In glory of my kinsman Hercules
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror
That is some satire keen and critical
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony
Merry and tragical tedious and brief
That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow
How shall we find the concord of this discord
PHILOSTRATE A play there is my lord some ten words long
Which is as brief as I have known a play
But by ten words my lord it is too long
Which makes it tedious for in all the play
There is not one word apt one player fitted
And tragical my noble lord it is
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself
Made mine eyes water but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed
THESEUS What are they that do play it
With this same play against your nuptial
THESEUS And we will hear it
PHILOSTRATE No my noble lord
It is not for you I have heard it over
And it is nothing nothing in the world
Unless you can find sport in their intents
To do you service
THESEUS I will hear that play
For never anything can be amiss
When simpleness and duty tender it
Go bring them in and take your places ladies
Exit PHILOSTRATE
And duty in his service perishing
THESEUS Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing
HIPPOLYTA He says they can do nothing in this kind
THESEUS The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake
And what poor duty cannot do noble respect
Takes it in might not merit
Where I have come great clerks have purposed
To greet me with premeditated welcomes
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale
Make periods in the midst of sentences
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off
Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence
In least speak most to my capacity
Enter QUINCE as the PROLOGUE
PROLOGUE If we offend it is with our good will
That you should think we come not to offend
But with good will To show our simple skill
That is the true beginning of our end
Consider then we come but in despite
We do not come as minding to content you
Our true intent is All for your delight
We are not here That you should here repent you
The actors are at band and by their show
You shall know all that you are like to know
THESEUS This fellow doth not stand upon points
LYSANDER He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not
the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but
to speak true
THESEUS His speech was like a tangled chain nothing im paired
but all disordered Who is next
Enter with a trumpet before them as in dumb show
PYRAMUS and THISBY WALL MOONSHINE and LION
PROLOGUE Gentles perchance you wonder at this show
But wonder on till truth make all things plain
This man is Pyramus if you would know
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain
Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder
And through Walls chink poor souls they are content
To whisper At the which let no man wonder
This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn
Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
This grisly beast which Lion hight by name
The trusty Thisby coming first by night
Did scare away or rather did affright
And as she fled her mantle she did fall
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain
Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall
Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade
And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade
His dagger drew and died For all the rest
Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain
At large discourse while here they do remain
Exeunt PROLOGUE PYRAMUS THISBY
LION and MOONSHINE
THESEUS I wonder if the lion be to speak
DEMETRIUS No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do
WALL In this same interlude it doth befall
That I one Snout by name present a wall
And such a wall as I would have you think
That had in it a crannied hole or chink
Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby
Did whisper often very secretly
That I am that same wall the truth is so
And this the cranny is right and sinister
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper
THESEUS Would you desire lime and hair to speak better
DEMETRIUS It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
discourse my lord
Enter PYRAMUS
THESEUS Pyramus draws near the wall silence
O night which ever art when day is not
O night O night alack alack alack
And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall
Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall
Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne
Thanks courteous wall Jove shield thee well for this
But what see what see I No Thisby do I see
O wicked wall through whom I see no bliss
THESEUS The wall methinks being sensible should curse again
cue She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall
You shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she comes
Enter THISBY
THISBY O wall full often hast thou beard my moans
For parting my fair Pyramus and me
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee
PYRAMUS I see a voice now will I to the chink
Thisby
THISBY My love thou art my love I think
And like Limander am I trusty still
THISBY And I like Helen till the Fates me kill
PYRAMUS Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true
THISBY As Shafalus to Procrus I to you
PYRAMUS O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall
THISBY Tide life tide death I come without delay
Exeunt PYRAMUS and THISBY
WALL Thus have I Wall my part discharged so
And being done thus Wall away doth go           Exit WALL
THESEUS Now is the moon used between the two neighbours
DEMETRIUS No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning
HIPPOLYTA This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard
THESEUS The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are
no worse if imagination amend them
HIPPOLYTA It must be your imagination then and not theirs
THESEUS If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves
they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a
man and a lion
Enter LION and MOONSHINE
LION You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor
May now perchance both quake and tremble here
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar
Then know that I as Snug the joiner am
For if I should as lion come in strife
THESEUS A very gentle beast and of a good conscience
LYSANDER This lion is a very fox for his valour
THESEUS True and a goose for his discretion
DEMETRIUS Not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his
discretion and the fox carries the goose
THESEUS His discretion I am sure cannot carry his valour for
the goose carries not the fox It is well Leave it to his
discretion and let us listen to the Moon
DEMETRIUS He should have worn the horns on his head
THESEUS He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the
circumference
MOONSHINE This lanthorn doth the horned moon present
THESEUS This is the greatest error of all the rest the man should
DEMETRIUS He dares not come there for the candle for you see it
is already in snuff
HIPPOLYTA I am aweary of this moon Would he would change
THESEUS It appears by his small light of discretion that he is
in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay
the time
LYSANDER Proceed Moon
MOON All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is
and this dog my dog
DEMETRIUS Why all these should be in the lantern for all these
are in the moon But silence here comes Thisby
THESEUS Well run Thisby
HIPPOLYTA Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good
DEMETRIUS And then came Pyramus
PYRAMUS Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams
I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright
For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight
But stay O spite
But mark poor knight
What dreadful dole is here
Eyes do you see
How can it he
O dainty duck O dear
Thy mantle good
Approach ye Furies fell
O Fates come come
Cut thread and thrum
Quail crush conclude and quell
THESEUS This passion and the death of a dear friend would go
near to make a man look sad
HIPPOLYTA Beshrew my heart but I pity the man
PYRAMUS O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame
Come tears confound
Out sword and wound
The pap of Pyramus
Ay that left pap
Thus die I thus thus thus
Now am I dead
Now am I fled
My soul is in the sky
Tongue lose thy light
DEMETRIUS No die but an ace for him for he is but one
LYSANDER Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing
THESEUS With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet
prove an ass
HIPPOLYTA How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back
and finds her lover
THESEUS She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her
passion ends the play
HIPPOLYTA Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
Pyramus I hope she will be brief
DEMETRIUS A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which
woman God bless us
LYSANDER She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes
THISBY      Asleep my love
What dead my dove
O Pyramus arise
Speak speak Quite dumb
Dead dead A tomb
Must cover thy sweet eyes
These lily lips
This cherry nose
These yellow cowslip cheeks
Are gone are gone
Lovers make moan
His eyes were green as leeks
O Sisters Three
Come come to me
With hands as pale as milk
Lay them in gore
Since you have shore
With shears his thread of silk
Tongue not a word
Come trusty sword
And farewell friends
Thus Thisby ends
THESEUS Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead
DEMETRIUS Ay and Wall too
parted their fathers Will it please you to see the Epilogue or
to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company
THESEUS No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse
Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none
to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed
A fortnight hold we this solemnity
In nightly revels and new jollity                    Exeunt
Enter PUCK with a broom
PUCK      Now the hungry lion roars
And the wolf behowls the moon
Whilst the heavy ploughman snores
All with weary task fordone
Now the wasted brands do glow
Puts the wretch that lies in woe
In remembrance of a shroud
Now it is the time of night
That the graves all gaping wide
Every one lets forth his sprite
And we fairies that do run
From the presence of the sun
Following darkness like a dream
Now are frolic Not a mouse
Shall disturb this hallowed house
I am sent with broom before
To sweep the dust behind the door
Enter OBERON and TITANIA with all their train
OBERON    Through the house give glimmering light
By the dead and drowsy fire
Every elf and fairy sprite
Hop as light as bird from brier
And this ditty after me
Sing and dance it trippingly
TITANIA      First rehearse your song by rote
To each word a warbling note
Hand in hand with fairy grace
Will we sing and bless this place
OBERON    Now until the break of day
Through this house each fairy stray
Which by us shall blessed be
And the issue there create
Ever shall be fortunate
So shall all the couples three
Ever true in loving be
Shall not in their issue stand
Nor mark prodigious such as are
Despised in nativity
Shall upon their children be
Every fairy take his gait
And each several chamber bless
Through this palace with sweet peace
And the owner of it blest
Ever shall in safety rest
Trip away make no stay
Meet me all by break of day    Exeunt all but PUCK
PUCK      If we shadows have offended
Think but this and all is mended
While these visions did appear
And this weak and idle theme
No more yielding but a dream
Gentles do not reprehend
If you pardon we will mend
And as I am an honest Puck
If we have unearned luck
We will make amends ere long
Else the Puck a liar call
So good night unto you all
Give me your hands if we be friends
And Robin shall restore amends                Exit

ACT I Scene I
Leon I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this
night to Messina
Mess He is very near by this He was not three leagues off when I
left him
Leon How many gentlemen have you lost in this action
Mess But few of any sort and none of name
Leon A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full
numbers I find here that Don Pedro hath bestowed much honour on
a young Florentine called Claudio
Pedro He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age doing
in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion He hath indeed
you how
Leon He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it
Mess I have already delivered him letters and there appears much
joy in him even so much that joy could not show itself modest
enough without a badge of bitterness
Leon Did he break out into tears
Mess In great measure
Leon A kind overflow of kindness There are no faces truer than
than to joy at weeping
Mess I know none of that name lady There was none such in the
army of any sort
Leon What is he that you ask for niece
Hero My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua
killing
be meet with you I doubt it not
Mess He hath done good service lady in these wars
Beat You had musty victual and he hath holp to eat it He is a
very valiant trencherman he hath an excellent stomach
Mess And a good soldier too lady
Beat And a good soldier to a lady but what is he to a lord
virtues
Leon You must not sir mistake my niece There is a kind of merry
a skirmish of wit between them
Beat Alas he gets nothing by that In our last conflict four of
with one so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm let
him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse for
it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable
creature Who is his companion now He hath every month a new
sworn brother
Beat Very easily possible He wears his faith but as the fashion
of his hat it ever changes with the next block
Mess I see lady the gentleman is not in your books
Beat No An he were I would burn my study But I pray you who is
his companion Is there no young squarer now that will make a
voyage with him to the devil
Mess He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio
Beat O Lord he will hang upon him like a disease He is sooner
caught than the pestilence and the taker runs presently mad God
help the noble Claudio If he have caught the Benedick it will
Mess I will hold friends with you lady
Beat Do good friend
Leon You will never run mad niece
Beat No not till a hot January
Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick Balthasar and John the Bastard
Pedro Good Signior Leonato are you come to meet your trouble The
fashion of the world is to avoid cost and you encounter it
Leon Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace
for trouble being gone comfort should remain but when you depart
from me sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave
Pedro You embrace your charge too willingly I think this is your
daughter
Leon Her mother hath many times told me so
Leon Signior Benedick no for then were you a child
Pedro You have it full Benedick We may guess by this what you
are being a man Truly the lady fathers herself Be happy lady
for you are like an honourable father
Bene If Signior Leonato be her father she would not have his head
on her shoulders for all Messina as like him as she is
Beat I wonder that you will still be talking Signior Benedick
Nobody marks you
Bene What my dear Lady Disdain are you yet living
Beat Is it possible Disdain should die while she hath such meet
food to feed it as Signior Benedick Courtesy itself must convert
to disdain if you come in her presence
Bene Then is courtesy a turncoat But it is certain I am loved of
all ladies only you excepted and I would I could find in my
heart that I had not a hard heart for truly I love none
Beat A dear happiness to women They would else have been troubled
with a pernicious suitor I thank God and my cold blood I am of
your humour for that I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow
than a man swear he loves me
Bene God keep your ladyship still in that mind So some gentleman
yours were
Beat A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours
Bene I would my horse had the speed of your tongue and so good a
Pedro That is the sum of all Leonato Signior Claudio and Signior
Benedick my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all I tell him
we shall stay here at the least a month and he heartly prays
some occasion may detain us longer I dare swear he is no
hypocrite but prays from his heart
Prince your brother I owe you all duty
John I thank you I am not of many words but I thank you
Leon Please it your Grace lead on
Pedro Your hand Leonato We will go together
Exeunt Manent Benedick and Claudio
Claud Benedick didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato
Claud Is she not a modest young lady
Bene Do you question me as an honest man should do for my simple
true judgment or would you have me speak after my custom as
being a professed tyrant to their sex
Claud No I pray thee speak in sober judgment
too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise
Only this commendation I can afford her that were she other
than she is she were unhandsome and being no other but as she
is I do not like her
Claud Thou thinkest I am in sport I pray thee tell me truly how
Bene Would you buy her that you enquire after her
Claud Can the world buy such a jewel
Bene Yea and a case to put it into But speak you this with a sad
brow or do you play the flouting Jack to tell us Cupid is a
shall a man take you to go in the song
Bene I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter
her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of
December But I hope you have no intent to turn husband have
you
Claud I would scarce trust myself though I had sworn the
contrary if Hero would be my wife
he will wear his cap with suspicion Shall I never see a
thrust thy neck into a yoke wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays
Enter Don Pedro
Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you
Pedro What secret hath held you here that you followed not to
Bene I would your Grace would constrain me to tell
Pedro I charge thee on thy allegiance
Bene You hear Count Claudio I can be secret as a dumb man I
daughter
Claud If my passion change not shortly God forbid it should be
otherwise
Pedro Amen if you love her for the lady is very well worthy
Claud You speak this to fetch me in my lord
Pedro By my troth I speak my thought
Claud And in faith my lord I spoke mine
Bene And by my two faiths and troths my lord I spoke mine
Claud That I love her I feel
Pedro That she is worthy I know
Bene That I neither feel how she should be loved nor know how she
should be worthy is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me
I will die in it at the stake
Pedro Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of
beauty
Claud And never could maintain his part but in the force of his
will
Bene That a woman conceived me I thank her that she brought me
up I likewise give her most humble thanks but that I will have
a rechate winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible
baldrick all women shall pardon me Because I will not do them
the wrong to mistrust any I will do myself the right to trust
live a bachelor
Pedro I shall see thee ere I die look pale with love
Bene With anger with sickness or with hunger my lord not with
love Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get
and hang me up at the door of a brothel house for the sign of
blind Cupid
Pedro Well if ever thou dost fall from this faith thou wilt
prove a notable argument
Bene If I do hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me and
Adam
Pedro Well as time shall try
Bene The savage bull may but if ever the sensible Benedick bear
let me be vilely painted and in such great letters as they write
Pedro Nay if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice thou
wilt quake for this shortly
Bene I look for an earthquake too then
Pedro Well you will temporize with the hours In the meantime
tell him I will not fail him at supper for indeed he hath made
great preparation
Bene I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage and
Pedro The sixth of July Your loving friend Benedick
Bene Nay mock not mock not The body of your discourse is
sometime guarded with fragments and the guards are but slightly
basted on neither Ere you flout old ends any further examine
your conscience And so I leave you                   Exit
Claud My liege your Highness now may do me good
Pedro My love is thine to teach Teach it but how
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
Any hard lesson that may do thee good
Claud Hath Leonato any son my lord
Dost thou affect her Claudio
ClaudO my lord
When you went onward on this ended action
Than to drive liking to the name of love
Have left their places vacant in their rooms
Come thronging soft and delicate desires
All prompting me how fair young Hero is
Pedro Thou wilt be like a lover presently
And tire the hearer with a book of words
If thou dost love fair Hero cherish it
And I will break with her and with her father
And thou shalt have her Wast not to this end
Claud How sweetly you do minister to love
But lest my liking might too sudden seem
Pedro What need the bridge much broader than the flood
The fairest grant is the necessity
And I will fit thee with the remedy
I will assume thy part in some disguise
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio
And take her hearing prisoner with the force
And strong encounter of my amorous tale
Then after to her father will I break
And the conclusion is she shall be thine
In practice let us put it presently                 Exeunt

show well outward The Prince and Count Claudio walking in a
a man of mine the Prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it this night in a
dance and if he found her accordant he meant to take the

Scene III
Enter Sir John the Bastard and Conrade his companion
Con What the goodyear my lord Why are you thus out of measure
sad
John There is no measure in the occasion that breeds therefore
the sadness is without limit
Con You should hear reason
John And when I have heard it what blessings brings it
Con If not a present remedy at least a patient sufferance
mortifying mischief I cannot hide what I am I must be sad when
man in his humour
Con Yea but you must not make the full show of this till you may
do it without controlment You have of late stood out against
it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair
weather that you make yourself It is needful that you frame the
season for your own harvest
John I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace
fashion a carriage to rob love from any In this though I cannot
be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but
my cage If I had my mouth I would bite if I had my liberty I
would do my liking In the meantime let me be that I am and seek

ACT II Scene I
Leon Was not Count John here at supper
Ant I saw him not
Beat How tartly that gentleman looks I never can see him but I am
Hero He is of a very melancholy disposition
Beat He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway
between him and Benedick The one is too like an image and says
tattling
Beat With a good leg and a good foot uncle and money enough in
could get her good will
Leon By my troth niece thou wilt never get thee a husband if
thou be so shrewd of thy tongue
but to a cow too curst he sends none
Leon So by being too curst God will send you no horns
Beat Just if he send me no husband for the which blessing I am
at him upon my knees every morning and evening Lord I could not
endure a husband with a beard on his face I had rather lie in
the woollen
Leon You may light on a husband that hath no beard
Beat What should I do with him dress him in my apparel and make
him my waiting gentlewoman He that hath a beard is more than a
youth and he that hath no beard is less than a man and he that
is more than a youth is not for me and he that is less than a
man I am not for him Therefore I will even take sixpence in
earnest of the berrord and lead his apes into hell
Leon Well then go you into hell
Beat No but to the gate and there will the devil meet me like an
He shows me where the bachelors sit and there live we as merry
as the day is long
father
be a handsome fellow or else make another cursy and say
Leon Well niece I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband
Beat Not till God make men of some other metal than earth Would
dust to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl
hold it a sin to match in my kinred
Leon Daughter remember what I told you If the Prince do solicit
you in that kind you know your answer
Beat The fault will be in the music cousin if you be not wooed
in good time If the Prince be too important tell him there is
measure in everything and so dance out the answer For hear me
Hero wooing wedding and repenting is as a Scotch jig a
modest as a measure full of state and ancientry and then comes
faster and faster till he sink into his grave
Leon Cousin you apprehend passing shrewdly
Beat I have a good eye uncle I can see a church by daylight
Pedro Lady will you walk a bout with your friend
Hero So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing
I am yours for the walk and especially when I walk away
Pedro With me in your company
Hero I may say so when I please
Pedro And when please you to say so
Hero When I like your favour for God defend the lute should be
like the case
Balth Well I would you did like me
Marg So would not I for your own sake for I have many ill
qualities
Balth Which is one
Marg I say my prayers aloud
Balth I love you the better The hearers may cry Amen
Marg God match me with a good dancer
Balth Amen
Marg And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is done
Answer clerk
Balth No more words The clerk is answered
Urs I know you well enough You are Signior Antonio
Ant At a word I am not
Urs I know you by the waggling of your head
Ant To tell you true I counterfeit him
Ant At a word I am not
Urs Come come do you think I do not know you by your excellent
wit Can virtue hide itself Go to mum you are he Graces will
Beat Will you not tell me who told you so
Bene No you shall pardon me
Beat Nor will you not tell me who you are
Bene Not now
Beat That I was disdainful and that I had my good wit out of the
Beat I am sure you know him well enough
Bene Not I believe me
Beat Did he never make you laugh
Bene I pray you what is he
gift is in devising impossible slanders None but libertines
delight in him and the commendation is not in his wit but in
his villany for he both pleases men and angers them and then
they laugh at him and beat him I am sure he is in the fleet
I would he had boarded me
will eat no supper that night
We must follow the leaders
Bene In every good thing
Beat Nay if they lead to any ill I will leave them at the next
turning
John Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath withdrawn her
father to break with him about it The ladies follow her and but
one visor remains
Bora And that is Claudio I know him by his bearing
John Are you not Signior Benedick
Claud You know me well I am he
John Signior you are very near my brother in his love He is
equal for his birth You may do the part of an honest man in it
Claud How know you he loves her
John I heard him swear his affection
Bora So did I too and he swore he would marry her tonight
John Come let us to the banquet
Exeunt Manet Claudio
Claud Thus answer I in name of Benedick
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love
Therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood
This is an accident of hourly proof
Which I mistrusted not Farewell therefore Hero
Bene Count Claudio
Claud Yea the same
Bene Come will you go with me
Claud Whither
Bene Even to the next willow about your own business County What
fashion will you wear the garland of about your neck like an
must wear it one way for the Prince hath got your Hero
Claud I wish him joy of her
bullocks But did you think the Prince would have served you
thus
Claud I pray you leave me
Bene Alas poor hurt fowl now will he creep into sedges But
that my Lady Beatrice should know me and not know me The
merry Yea but so I am apt to do myself wrong I am not so
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out Well
Enter Don Pedro
Bene Troth my lord I have played the part of Lady Fame I found
him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren I told him and I
think I told him true that your Grace had got the good will of
either to make him a garland as being forsaken or to bind him
up a rod as being worthy to be whipt
Bene The flat transgression of a schoolboy who being overjoyed
Pedro Wilt thou make a trust a transgression The transgression is
in the stealer
Bene Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made and the
garland too for the garland he might have worn himself and the
Pedro I will but teach them to sing and restore them to the owner
Bene If their singing answer your saying by my faith you say
honestly
Pedro The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you The gentleman that
with one green leaf on it would have answered her my very visor
began to assume life and scold with her She told me not
I was duller than a great thaw huddling jest upon jest with such
impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark
with a whole army shooting at me She speaks poniards and every
word stabs If her breath were as terrible as her terminations
there were no living near her she would infect to the North
Star I would not marry her though she were endowed with all that
the fire too Come talk not of her You shall find her the
infernal Ate in good apparel I would to God some scholar would
conjure her for certainly while she is here a man may live as
quiet in hell as in a sanctuary and people sin upon purpose
because they would go thither so indeed all disquiet horror
and perturbation follows her
Enter Claudio and Beatrice Leonato Hero
Pedro Look here she comes
will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can
devise to send me on I will fetch you a toothpicker now from the
conference with this harpy You have no employment for me
Pedro None but to desire your good company
Pedro Come lady come you have lost the heart of Signior
Benedick
Beat Indeed my lord he lent it me awhile and I gave him use for
it of me with false dice therefore your Grace may well say I
have lost it
Pedro You have put him down lady you have put him down
Beat So I would not he should do me my lord lest I should prove
the mother of fools I have brought Count Claudio whom you sent
me to seek
Pedro Why how now Count Wherefore are you sad
Claud Not sad my lord
Pedro How then sick
Claud Neither my lord
Beat The Count is neither sad nor sick nor merry nor well but
complexion
be sworn if he be so his conceit is false Here Claudio I
have wooed in thy name and fair Hero is won I have broke with
her father and his good will obtained Name the day of marriage
and God give thee joy
Leon Count take of me my daughter and with her my fortunes His
Grace hath made the match and all grace say Amen to it
Claud Silence is the perfectest herald of joy I were but little
happy if I could say how much Lady as you are mine I am yours
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange
Beat Speak cousin or if you cannot stop his mouth with a kiss
and let not him speak neither
Pedro In faith lady you have a merry heart
Beat Yea my lord I thank it poor fool it keeps on the windy
side of care My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her
heart
Claud And so she doth cousin
Beat Good Lord for alliance Thus goes every one to the world but
Pedro Lady Beatrice I will get you one
husbands if a maid could come by them
Pedro Will you have me lady
Beat No my lord unless I might have another for working days
your Grace is too costly to wear every day But I beseech your
Grace pardon me I was born to speak all mirth and no matter
Pedro Your silence most offends me and to be merry best becomes
Beat No sure my lord my mother cried but then there was a star
Leon Niece will you look to those things I told you of
is never sad but when she sleeps and not ever sad then for I
have heard my daughter say she hath often dreamt of unhappiness
Pedro She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband
Leon O by no means She mocks all her wooers out of suit
Pedro She were an excellent wife for Benedick
Leon O Lord my lord if they were but a week married they would
talk themselves mad
Pedro County Claudio when mean you to go to church
his rites
Leon Not till Monday my dear son which is hence a just
sevennight and a time too brief too to have all things answer
my mind
Pedro Come you shake the head at so long a breathing
but I warrant thee Claudio the time shall not go dully by us
is to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a
it a match and I doubt not but to fashion it if you three will
but minister such assistance as I shall give you direction
watchings
Claud And I my lord
Pedro And you too gentle Hero
Hero I will do any modest office my lord to help my cousin to a
good husband
Pedro And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that I know
Thus far can I praise him he is of a noble strain of approved
your cousin that she shall fall in love with Benedick and I
Benedick that in despite of his quick wit and his queasy
stomach he shall fall in love with Beatrice If we can do this
Cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for we are
Exeunt
Scene II
John It is so The Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of
Leonato
Bora Yea my lord but I can cross it
I am sick in displeasure to him and whatsoever comes athwart his
affection ranges evenly with mine How canst thou cross this
marriage
Bora Not honestly my lord but so covertly that no dishonesty
shall appear in me
John Show me briefly how
Bora I think I told your lordship a year since how much I am in
the favour of Margaret the waiting gentlewoman to Hero
John I remember
Bora I can at any unseasonable instant of the night appoint her
John What life is in that to be the death of this marriage
Bora The poison of that lies in you to temper Go you to the
Prince your brother spare not to tell him that he hath wronged
Hero
John What proof shall I make of that
Bora Proof enough to misuse the Prince to vex Claudio to undo
Hero and kill Leonato Look you for any other issue
John Only to despite them I will endeavour anything
Bora Go then find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and the Count
Claudio alone tell them that you know that Hero loves me intend
this without trial Offer them instances which shall bear no
less likelihood than to see me at her chamber window hear me
call Margaret Hero hear Margaret term me Claudio and bring them
the meantime I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
preparation overthrown
John Grow this to what adverse issue it can I will put it in
practice Be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a
thousand ducats
Bora Be you constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not
shame me
John I will presently go learn their day of marriage
Exeunt
Scene III
Enter Benedick alone
Bene Boy
Boy Signior
Bene In my chamber window lies a book Bring it hither to me in
the orchard
Boy I am here already sir
Bene I know that but I would have thee hence and here again
another man is a fool when he dedicates his behaviours to love
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love and such
a man is Claudio I have known when there was no music with him
but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor
afoot to see a good armour and now will he lie ten nights awake
carving the fashion of a new doublet He was wont to speak plain
and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is
just so many strange dishes May I be so converted and see with
these eyes I cannot tell I think not I will not be sworn but
till he have made an oyster of me he shall never make me such a
fool One woman is fair yet I am well another is wise yet I am
well another virtuous yet I am well but till all graces be in
one woman one woman shall not come in my grace Rich she shall
near me noble or not I for an angel of good discourse an
excellent musician and her hair shall be of what colour it
please God Ha the Prince and Monsieur Love I will hide me in
Enter Don Pedro Leonato Claudio
Pedro Come shall we hear this music
Claud Yea my good lord How still the evening is
Pedro See you where Benedick hath hid himself
Claud O very well my lord The music ended
Enter Balthasar with Music
Balth O good my lord tax not so bad a voice
To slander music any more than once
Pedro It is the witness still of excellency
To put a strange face on his own perfection
I pray thee sing and let me woo no more
Balth Because you talk of wooing I will sing
Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
To her he thinks not worthy yet he wooes
Yet will he swear he loves
Pedro Nay pray thee come
Or if thou wilt hold longer argument
Do it in notes
Balth Note this before my notes
Pedro Why these are very crotchets that he speaks
The Song
Sigh no more ladies sigh no more
Men were deceivers ever
One foot in sea and one on shore
To one thing constant never
Then sigh not so
But let them go
And be you blithe and bonny
Converting all your sounds of woe
Into Hey nonny nonny
Sing no more ditties sing no moe
Of dumps so dull and heavy
The fraud of men was ever so
Since summer first was leavy
Then sigh not so &c
Pedro By my troth a good song
Balth And an ill singer my lord
mischief I had as live have heard the night raven come what
plague could have come after it
Pedro Yea marry Dost thou hear Balthasar I pray thee get us
Balth The best I can my lord
Pedro Do so Farewell
your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick
Leon No nor I neither but most wonderful that she should so dote
on Signior Benedick whom she hath in all outward behaviours
Leon By my troth my lord I cannot tell what to think of it but
that she loves him with an enraged affection It is past the
infinite of thought
Pedro May be she doth but counterfeit
Claud Faith like enough
Leon O God counterfeit There was never counterfeit of passion
came so near the life of passion as she discovers it
Pedro Why what effects of passion shows she
daughter tell you how
Claud She did indeed
Pedro How how I pray you You amaze me I would have thought her
spirit had been invincible against all assaults of affection
Benedick
fellow speaks it Knavery cannot sure hide himself in such
reverence
Pedro Hath she made her affection known to Benedick
Leon This says she now when she is beginning to write to him for
smock till she have writ a sheet of paper My daughter tells us
all
Claud Now you talk of a sheet of paper I remember a pretty jest
your daughter told us of
Leon O when she had writ it and was reading it over she found
Claud That
herself that she should be so immodest to write to one that she
spirit for I should flout him if he writ to me Yea though I
Claud Then down upon her knees she falls weeps sobs beats her
Leon She doth indeed my daughter says so And the ecstasy hath so
much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will
do a desperate outrage to herself It is very true
Pedro It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other if she
will not discover it
Claud To what end He would make but a sport of it and torment the
poor lady worse
Claud And she is exceeding wise
Pedro In everything but in loving Benedick
Leon O my lord wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory I am sorry
for her as I have just cause being her uncle and her guardian
Pedro I would she had bestowed this dotage on me I would have
Leon Were it good think you
Claud Hero thinks surely she will die for she says she will die
if he love her not and she will die ere she make her love known
and she will die if he woo her rather than she will bate one
breath of her accustomed crossness
a contemptible spirit
Claud He is a very proper man
Pedro He hath indeed a good outward happiness
Claud Before God and in my mind very wise
Pedro He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit
Claud And I take him to be valiant
Pedro As Hector I assure you and in the managing of quarrels you
may say he is wise for either he avoids them with great
discretion or undertakes them with a most Christianlike fear
break the peace he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and
trembling
Pedro And so will he do for the man doth fear God howsoever it
seems not in him by some large jests he will make Well I am
sorry for your niece Shall we go seek Benedick and tell him of
her love
Claud Never tell him my lord Let her wear it out with good
counsel
Pedro Well we will hear further of it by your daughter Let it
cool the while I love Benedick well and I could wish he would
modestly examine himself to see how much he is unworthy so good a
lady
Leon My lord will you walk Dinner is ready
Claud If he dote on her upon this I will never trust my
expectation
Pedro Let there be the same net spread for her and that must your
daughter and her gentlewomen carry The sport will be when they
show Let us send her to call him in to dinner
Bene This can be no trick The conference was sadly borne they
have the truth of this from Hero they seem to pity the lady
It seems her affections have their full bent Love me Why it
myself proudly if I perceive the love come from her They say too
that she will rather die than give any sign of affection I did
never think to marry I must not seem proud Happy are they that
hear their detractions and can put them to mending They say the
my troth it is no addition to her wit nor no great argument of
her folly for I will be horribly in love with her I may chance
have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because I
have railed so long against marriage But doth not the appetite
alters A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure
in his age Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour No the world
must be peopled When I said I would die a bachelor I did not
think I should live till I were married
Enter Beatrice
some marks of love in her
Beat Against my will I am sent to bid You come in to dinner
Bene Fair Beatrice I thank you for your pains
Beat I took no more pains for those thanks than you take pains to
thank me If it had been painful I would not have come
Bene You take pleasure then in the message
Beat Yea just so much as you may take upon a knives point and
choke a daw withal You have no stomach signior Fare you well
Exit
do not take pity of her I am a villain if I do not love her I
am a Jew I will go get her picture                   Exit

ACT III Scene I
Enter Hero and two Gentlewomen Margaret and Ursula
Hero Good Margaret run thee to the parlour
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the Prince and Claudio
Whisper her ear and tell her I and Ursley
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
And bid her steal into the pleached bower
Where honeysuckles ripened by the sun
Made proud by princes that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it There will she hide her
To listen our propose This is thy office
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone
Hero Now Ursula when Beatrice doth come
As we do trace this alley up and down
Our talk must only be of Benedick
When I do name him let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice Of this matter
That only wounds by hearsay
Now begin
For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
Close by the ground to hear our conference
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream
And greedily devour the treacherous bait
So angle we for Beatrice who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture
Fear you not my part of the dialogue
Hero Then go we near her that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it
No truly Ursula she is too disdainful
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggards of the rock
Urs But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely
Urs And did they bid you tell her of it madam
Hero They did entreat me to acquaint her of it
To wish him wrestle with affection
And never to let Beatrice know of it
Urs Why did you so Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon
Hero O god of love I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes
Misprizing what they look on and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak She cannot love
Nor take no shape nor project of affection
Urs Sure I think so
And therefore certainly it were not good
Hero Why you speak truth I never yet saw man
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister
If black why Nature drawing of an antic
If low an agate very vilely cut
If speaking why a vane blown with all winds
If silent why a block moved with none
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth
Urs Sure sure such carping is not commendable
Hero No not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is cannot be commendable
But who dare tell her so If I should speak
She would mock me into air O she would laugh me
Out of myself press me to death with wit
Consume away in sighs waste inwardly
It were a better death than die with mocks
Which is as bad as die with tickling
Urs Yet tell her of it Hear what she will say
Hero No rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion
To stain my cousin with One doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking
Urs O do not do your cousin such a wrong
She cannot be so much without true judgment
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick
Hero He is the only man of Italy
Always excepted my dear Claudio
Urs I pray you be not angry with me madam
Speaking my fancy Signior Benedick
For shape for bearing argument and valour
Goes foremost in report through Italy
Hero Indeed he hath an excellent good name
Urs His excellence did earn it ere he had it
When are you married madam
Hero If it prove so then loving goes by haps
Some Cupid kills with arrows some with traps
Beat What fire is in mine ears Can this be true
Contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu
No glory lives behind the back of such
And Benedick love on I will requite thee
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand
If thou dost love my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band
For others say thou dost deserve and I
Believe it better than reportingly                    Exit
Scene II
Enter Don Pedro Claudio Benedick and Leonato
Pedro I do but stay till your marriage be consummate and then go
I toward Arragon
Pedro Nay that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your
marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear
it I will only be bold with Benedick for his company for from
the crown of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth
hangman dare not shoot at him He hath a heart as sound as a
bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinks
his tongue speaks
Bene Gallants I am not as I have been
Leon So say I Methinks you are sadder
Claud I hope he be in love
Bene I have the toothache
Pedro Draw it
Bene Hang it
Claud You must hang it first and draw it afterwards
Pedro What sigh for the toothache
Leon Where is but a humour or a worm
Bene Well every one can master a grief but he that has it
Claud Yet say I he is in love
Pedro There is no appearance of fancy in him unless it be a fancy
a German from the waist downward all slops and a Spaniard from
the hip upward no doublet Unless he have a fancy to this
foolery as it appears he hath he is no fool for fancy as you
would have it appear he is
Claud If he be not in love with some woman there is no believing
Leon Indeed he looks younger than he did by the loss of a beard
that
Pedro The greatest note of it is his melancholy
Claud And when was he wont to wash his face
Pedro Yea or to paint himself for the which I hear what they say
of him
Pedro Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him Conclude conclude
he is in love
Claud Nay but I know who loves him
Pedro That would I know too I warrant one that knows him not
Claud Yes and his ill conditions and in despite of all dies for
him
Pedro She shall be buried with her face upwards
Bene Yet is this no charm for the toothache Old signior walk
aside with me I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak
Pedro For my life to break with him about Beatrice
parts with Beatrice and then the two bears will not bite one
another when they meet
Enter John the Bastard
John My lord and brother God save you
Pedro Good den brother
Pedro In private
John If it please you Yet Count Claudio may hear for what I
would speak of concerns him
Pedro You know he does
John I know not that when he knows what I know
Claud If there be any impediment I pray you discover it
John You may think I love you not Let that appear hereafter and
aim better at me by that I now will manifest For my brother I
think he holds you well and in dearness of heart hath holp to
ill bestowed
Claud Who Hero
Claud Disloyal
John The word is too good to paint out her wickedness I could say
she were worse think you of a worse title and I will fit her to
would better fit your honour to change your mind
Claud May this be so
Pedro I will not think it
John If you dare not trust that you see confess not that you
know If you will follow me I will show you enough and when you
have seen more and heard more proceed accordingly
shame her
Pedro And as I wooed for thee to obtain her I will join with
thee to disgrace her
John I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses
Bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself
Pedro O day untowardly turned
Claud O mischief strangely thwarting
John O plague right well prevented
So will you say when you have seen the Sequel
Exeunt

favour sir why give God thanks and make no boast of it and
for your writing and reading let that appear when there is no
need of such vanity You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch Therefore
bear you the lanthorn This is your charge you shall comprehend
name
Dog Why then take no note of him but let him go and presently
call the rest of the watch together and thank God you are rid of
a knave
Verg If he will not stand when he is bidden he is none of the
subjects You shall also make no noise in the streets for for
the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be
endured
2 Watch We will rather sleep than talk We know what belongs to
a watch
Dog Why you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend Only have a care that your
and bid those that are drunk get them to bed
2 Watch How if they will not
Dog Why then let them alone till they are sober If they make you
not then the better answer You may say they are not the men you
took them for
2 Watch Well sir
Dog If you meet a thief you may suspect him by virtue of your
office to be no true man and for such kind of men the less you
meddle or make with them why the more your honesty
2 Watch If we know him to be a thief shall we not lay hands on
him
Dog Truly by your office you may but I think they that touch
take a thief is to let him show himself what he is and steal
out of your company
Verg You have been always called a merciful man partner
Dog Truly I would not hang a dog by my will much more a man who
hath any honesty in him
Verg If you hear a child cry in the night you must call to the
nurse and bid her still it
2 Watch How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us
Dog Why then depart in peace and let the child wake her with
crying for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will
never answer a calf when he bleats
Dog This is the end of the charge you constable are to present
you may stay him
statutes he may stay him Marry not without the Prince be
willing for indeed the watch ought to offend no man and it is
an offence to stay a man against his will
Dog Ha ah ha Well masters good night An there be any matter
your own and good night Come neighbour
2 Watch Well masters we hear our charge Let us go sit here
upon the church bench till two and then all to bed
Dog One word more honest neighbours I pray you watch about
Enter Borachio and Conrade
Bora What Conrade
Bora Conrade I say
Con Here man I am at thy elbow
follow
Con I will owe thee an answer for that and now forward with thy
tale
Bora Stand thee close then under this penthouse for it drizzles
rain and I will like a true drunkard utter all to thee
Bora Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats
Con Is it possible that any villany should be so dear
Bora Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villany
should be so rich for when rich villains have need of poor ones
poor ones may make what price they will
Con I wonder at it
fashion of a doublet or a hat or a cloak is nothing to a man
Con Yes it is apparel
Bora I mean the fashion
Con Yes the fashion is the fashion
not what a deformed thief this fashion is
his name
Bora Didst thou not hear somebody
Bora Seest thou not I say what a deformed thief this fashion is
in the old church window sometime like the shaven Hercules in
massy as his club
Con All this I see and I see that the fashion wears out more
apparel than the man But art not thou thyself giddy with the
fashion too that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling
me of the fashion
the Prince Claudio and my master planted and placed and
possessed by my master Don John saw afar off in the orchard this
amiable encounter
Con And thought they Margaret was Hero
Bora Two of them did the Prince and Claudio but the devil my
master knew she was Margaret and partly by his oaths which
them but chiefly by my villany which did confirm any slander
meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple and
there before the whole congregation shame her with what he saw

ACT IV Scene I
A church
Leon Come Friar Francis be brief Only to the plain form of
marriage and you shall recount their particular duties
afterwards
Friar You come hither my lord to marry this lady
Claud No
Leon To be married to her Friar you come to marry her
Friar Lady you come hither to be married to this count
Hero I do
Friar If either of you know any inward impediment why you should
not be conjoined I charge you on your souls to utter it
Claud Know you any Hero
Hero None my lord
Friar Know you any Count
Claud O what men dare do what men may do what men daily do not
knowing what they do
Bene How now interjections Why then some be of laughing as
ah ha he
Claud Stand thee by friar Father by your leave
Will you with free and unconstrained soul
Give me this maid your daughter
Leon As freely son as God did give her me
Claud And what have I to give you back whose worth
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift
Pedro Nothing unless you render her again
Claud Sweet Prince you learn me noble thankfulness
There Leonato take her back again
Give not this rotten orange to your friend
Behold how like a maid she blushes here
O what authority and show of truth
Can cunning sin cover itself withal
Comes not that blood as modest evidence
To witness simple virtue Would you not swear
All you that see her that she were a maid
By these exterior shows But she is none
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed
Her blush is guiltiness not modesty
Leon What do you mean my lord
Claud Not to be married
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton
Leon Dear my lord if you in your own proof
Claud I know what you would say If I have known her
You will say she did embrace me as a husband
And so extenuate the forehand sin
No Leonato
I never tempted her with word too large
Bashful sincerity and comely love
Claud Out on the seeming I will write against it
You seem to me as Dian in her orb
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown
But you are more intemperate in your blood
That rage in savage sensuality
Hero Is my lord well that he doth speak so wide
Leon Sweet Prince why speak not you
Pedro What should I speak
To link my dear friend to a common stale
Leon Are these things spoken or do I but dream
John Sir they are spoken and these things are true
Bene This looks not like a nuptial
Claud Leonato stand I here
Leon All this is so but what of this my lord
Claud Let me but move one question to your daughter
And by that fatherly and kindly power
That you have in her bid her answer truly
Leon I charge thee do so as thou art my child
Hero O God defend me How am I beset
What kind of catechising call you this
Claud To make you answer truly to your name
Hero Is it not Hero Who can blot that name
With any just reproach
Claud Marry that can Hero
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one
Now if you are a maid answer to this
Pedro Why then are you no maiden Leonato
I am sorry you must hear Upon my honour
Myself my brother and this grieved Count
Did see her hear her at that hour last night
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber window
Who hath indeed most like a liberal villain
A thousand times in secret
Not to be spoke of
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offence to utter them Thus pretty lady
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment
Claud O Hero what a Hero hadst thou been
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart
But fare thee well most foul most fair Farewell
Thou pure impiety and impious purity
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm
And never shall it more be gracious
Beat Why how now cousin Wherefore sink you down
John Come let us go These things come thus to light
Smother her spirits up
Bene How doth the lady
Beat Dead I think Help uncle
Hero why Hero Uncle Signior Benedick Friar
Leon O Fate take not away thy heavy hand
Death is the fairest cover for her shame
Beat How now cousin Hero
Friar Have comfort lady
Leon Dost thou look up
Friar Yea wherefore should she not
Leon Wherefore Why doth not every earthly thing
Cry shame upon her Could she here deny
The story that is printed in her blood
Do not live Hero do not ope thine eyes
For did I think thou wouldst not quickly die
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames
Myself would on the rearward of reproaches
O one too much by thee Why had I one
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes
Why had I not with charitable hand
That I myself was to myself not mine
Into a pit of ink that the wide sea
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
And salt too little which may season give
To her foul tainted flesh
Bene Sir sir be patient
I know not what to say
Beat O on my soul my cousin is belied
Bene Lady were you her bedfellow last night
Beat No truly not although until last night
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow
Would the two princes lie and Claudio lie
Friar Hear me a little
For I have only been silent so long
And given way unto this course of fortune
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth Call me a fool
Trust not my reading nor my observation
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenure of my book trust not my age
My reverence calling nor divinity
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error
Leon Friar it cannot be
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury she not denies it
That which appears in proper nakedness
Hero They know that do accuse me I know none
If I know more of any man alive
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant
Let all my sins lack mercy O my father
At hours unmeet or that I yesternight
Refuse me hate me torture me to death
Friar There is some strange misprision in the princes
Bene Two of them have the very bent of honour
And if their wisdoms be misled in this
The practice of it lives in John the bastard
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies
Leon I know not If they speak but truth of her
These hands shall tear her If they wrong her honour
The proudest of them shall well hear of it
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine
Nor age so eat up my invention
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends
Both strength of limb and policy of mind
Ability in means and choice of friends
To quit me of them throughly
Friar Pause awhile
And let my counsel sway you in this case
Your daughter here the princes left for dead
Let her awhile be secretly kept in
And publish it that she is dead indeed
Maintain a mourning ostentation
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial
Leon What shall become of this What will this do
Friar Marry this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse That is some good
But not for that dream I on this strange course
But on this travail look for greater birth
Of every hearer for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Why then we rack the value then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours So will it fare with Claudio
When he shall hear she died upon his words
Into his study of imagination
And every lovely organ of her life
More moving delicate and full of life
Into the eye and prospect of his soul
No though be thought his accusation true
Let this be so and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood
Will quench the wonder of her infamy
And if it sort not well you may conceal her
As best befits her wounded reputation
In some reclusive and religious life
Out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries
Bene Signior Leonato let the friar advise you
And though you know my inwardness and love
Is very much unto the Prince and Claudio
Yet by mine honour I will deal in this
As secretly and justly as your soul
Should with your body
Leon Being that I flow in grief
The smallest twine may lead me
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure
Come lady die to live This wedding day
Bene Lady Beatrice have you wept all this while
Beat Yea and I will weep a while longer
Bene I will not desire that
Beat You have no reason I do it freely
Bene Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged
Beat Ah how much might the man deserve of me that would right
her
Bene Is there any way to show such friendship
Beat A very even way but no such friend
Bene May a man do it
Bene I do love nothing in the world so well as you Is not that
strange
Beat As strange as the thing I know not It were as possible for
me to say I loved nothing so well as you But believe me not and
yet I lie not I confess nothing nor I deny nothing I am sorry
for my cousin
Bene By my sword Beatrice thou lovest me
Beat Do not swear and eat it
Bene I will swear by it that you love me and I will make him eat
it that says I love not you
Beat Will you not eat your word
Bene With no sauce that can be devised to it I protest I love
thee
Beat Why then God forgive me
Bene What offence sweet Beatrice
Beat You have stayed me in a happy hour I was about to protest I
loved you
Bene And do it with all thy heart
Beat I love you with so much of my heart that none is left to
protest
Bene Come bid me do anything for thee
Beat Kill Claudio
Bene Ha not for the wide world
Beat You kill me to deny it Farewell
Bene Tarry sweet Beatrice
Beat I am gone though I am here There is no love in you Nay I
pray you let me go
Beat In faith I will go
Beat You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine
enemy
Bene Is Claudio thine enemy
slandered scorned dishonoured my kinswoman O that I were a
man What bear her in hand until they come to take hands and
market place
Bene Hear me Beatrice
Beat Princes and Counties Surely a princely testimony a goodly
count Count Comfect a sweet gallant surely O that I were a man
for his sake or that I had any friend would be a man for my
sake But manhood is melted into cursies valour into compliment
as valiant as Hercules that only tells a lieand swears it I
cannot be a man with wishing therefore I will die a woman with
grieving
Bene Tarry good Beatrice By this hand I love thee
Beat Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it
Beat Yea as sure is I have a thought or a soul
hand and so I leave you By this hand Claudio shall render me a
dear account As you hear of me so think of me Go comfort your

ACT V Scene I
Ant If you go on thus you will kill yourself
Against yourself
Leon I pray thee cease thy counsel
Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve Give not me counsel
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine
And bid him speak to me of patience
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain
As thus for thus and such a grief for such
In every lineament branch shape and form
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard
Patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk
And I of him will gather patience
But there is no such man for brother men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel but tasting it
Their counsel turns to passion which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread
Charm ache with air and agony with words
To those that wring under the load of sorrow
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself Therefore give me no counsel
My griefs cry louder than advertisement
Ant Therein do men from children nothing differ
Leon I pray thee peace I will be flesh and blood
For there was never yet philosopher
That could endure the toothache patiently
However they have writ the style of gods
And made a push at chance and sufferance
Ant Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself
Make those that do offend you suffer too
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied
And that shall Claudio know so shall the Prince
And all of them that thus dishonour her
Enter Don Pedro and Claudio
Ant Here comes the Prince and Claudio hastily
Pedro Good den Good den
Claud Good day to both of you
Leon Hear you my lords
Pedro We have some haste Leonato
Leon Some haste my lord well fare you well my lord
Are you so hasty now Well all is one
Pedro Nay do not quarrel with us good old man
Ant If he could right himself with quarrelling
Some of us would lie low
Claud Who wrongs him
Leon Marry thou dost wrong me thou dissembler thou
Nay never lay thy hand upon thy sword
I fear thee not
Claud Mary beshrew my hand
If it should give your age such cause of fear
In faith my hand meant nothing to my sword
Leon Tush tush man never fleer and jest at me
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool
As under privilege of age to brag
What I have done being young or what would do
Were I not old Know Claudio to thy head
And with grey hairs and bruise of many days
Do challenge thee to trial of a man
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart
O in a tomb where never scandal slept
Claud My villany
Leon Thine Claudio thine I say
Pedro You say not right old man
Leon My lord my lord
Despite his nice fence and his active practice
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood
Claud Away I will not have to do with you
And He shall kill two of us and men indeed
Win me and wear me Let him answer me
Come follow me boy Come sir boy come follow me
Nay as I am a gentleman I will
That dare as well answer a man indeed
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue
Boys apes braggarts jacks milksops
Ant Hold you content What man I know them yea
And what they weigh even to the utmost scruple
That lie and cog and flout deprave and slander
Go anticly show outward hideousness
How they might hurt their enemies if they durst
And this is all
Do not you meddle let me deal in this
Pedro Gentlemen both we will not wake your patience
But what was true and very full of proof
Pedro I will not hear you
Ant And shall or some of us will smart for it
Exeunt ambo
Enter Benedick
Pedro See see Here comes the man we went to seek
Claud Now signior what news
Bene Good day my lord
Pedro Welcome signior You are almost come to part almost a fray
old men without teeth
I doubt we should have been too young for them
Bene In a false quarrel there is no true valour I came to seek
you both
melancholy and would fain have it beaten away Wilt thou use thy
wit
Bene It is in my scabbard Shall I draw it
Pedro Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side
Claud Never any did so though very many have been beside their
pleasure us
Pedro As I am an honest man he looks pale Art thou sick or
angry
mettle enough in thee to kill care
Bene Sir I shall meet your wit in the career an you charge it
against me I pray you choose another subject
Claud Nay then give him another staff this last was broke cross
Pedro By this light he changes more and more I think he be angry
indeed
Claud If he be he knows how to turn his girdle
Bene Shall I speak a word in your ear
Claud God bless me from a challenge
it good how you dare with what you dare and when you dare Do
sweet lady and her death shall fall heavy on you Let me hear
from you
Claud Well I will meet you so I may have good cheer
Pedro What a feast a feast
a capon the which if I do not carve most curiously say my
Bene Sir your wit ambles well it goes easily
together transshape thy particular virtues Yet at last she
Claud For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not
Pedro Yea that she did but yet for all that an if she did not
daughter told us all
Claud All all and moreover God saw him when he was hid in the
garden
Bene Fare you well boy you know my mind I will leave you now to
your gossiplike humour You break jests as braggards do their
blades which God be thanked hurt not My lord for your many
courtesies I thank you I must discontinue your company Your
brother the bastard is fled from Messina You have among you
and I shall meet and till then peace be with him
Pedro He is in earnest
love of Beatrice
Claud Most sincerely
Pedro What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his doublet and
hose and leaves off his wit
Conrade and Borachio
Claud He is then a giant to an ape but then is an ape a doctor to
such a man
Pedro But soft you let me be Pluck up my heart and be sad
Did he not say my brother was fled
weigh more reasons in her balance Nay an you be a cursing
Claud Hearken after their offence my lord
Pedro Officers what offence have these men done
Dog Marry sir they have committed false report moreover they
have spoken untruths secondarily they are slanders sixth and
lastly they have belied a lady thirdly they have verified
unjust things and to conclude they are lying knaves
Pedro First I ask thee what they have done thirdly I ask thee
and to conclude what you lay to their charge
Claud Rightly reasoned and in his own division and by my troth
Pedro Who have you offended masters that you are thus bound to
your answer This learned constable is too cunning to be
Bora Sweet Prince let me go no farther to mine answer Do you
hear me and let this Count kill me I have deceived even your
very eyes What your wisdoms could not discover these shallow
fools have brought to light who in the night overheard me
confessing to this man how Don John your brother incensed me to
slander the Lady Hero how you were brought into the orchard and
when you should marry her My villany they have upon record
which I had rather seal with my death than repeat over to my
accusation and briefly I desire nothing but the reward of a
villain
Pedro Runs not this speech like iron through your blood
Pedro But did my brother set thee on to this
Bora Yea and paid me richly for the practice of it
And fled he is upon this villany
Claud Sweet Hero now thy image doth appear
Dog Come bring away the plaintiffs By this time our sexton hath
reformed Signior Leonato of the matter And masters do not
forget to specify when time and place shall serve that I am an
ass
Verg Here here comes Master Signior Leonato and the sexton too
Leon Which is the villain Let me see his eyes
That when I note another man like him
I may avoid him Which of these is he
Bora If you would know your wronger look on me
Mine innocent child
Bora Yea even I alone
Leon No not so villain thou beliest thyself
Record it with your high and worthy deeds
Claud I know not how to pray your patience
Yet I must speak Choose your revenge yourself
Impose me to what penance your invention
But in mistaking
Pedro By my soul nor I
And yet to satisfy this good old man
I would bend under any heavy weight
That were impossible but I pray you both
Possess the people in Messina here
How innocent she died and if your love
Can labour aught in sad invention
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
Be yet my nephew My brother hath a daughter
And she alone is heir to both of us
And so dies my revenge
Claud O noble sir
I do embrace your offer and dispose
For henceforth of poor Claudio
Shall fact to face be brought to Margaret
Bora No by my soul she was not
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me
But always hath been just and virtuous
In anything that I do know by her
Dog Moreover sir which indeed is not under white and black this
plaintiff here the offender did call me ass I beseech you let
talk of one Deformed They say he wears a key in his ear and a
that point
Leon I thank thee for thy care and honest pains
Dog Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent youth
and I praise God for you
Dog God save the foundation
Leon Go I discharge thee of thy prisoner and I thank thee
Dog I leave an arrant knave with your worship which I beseech
your worship to correct yourself for the example of others
God keep your worship I wish your worship well God restore you
to health I humbly give you leave to depart and if a merry
Pedro We will not fall

Scene II
Bene Pray thee sweet Mistress Margaret deserve well at my hands

Marg To have no man come over me Why shall I always keep below

Bene A most manly wit Margaret it will not hurt a woman
And so I pray thee call Beatrice I give thee the bucklers
Marg Give us the swords we have bucklers of our own
Bene If you use them Margaret you must put in the pikes with a
vice and they are dangerous weapons for maids
Marg Well I will call Beatrice to you who I think hath legs
Bene And therefore will come
Exit Margaret
That sits above
And knows me and knows me
I mean in singing but in loving Leander the good swimmer
Troilus the first employer of panders and a whole book full of
over and over as my poor self in love Marry I cannot show it in
was not born under a rhyming planet nor cannot woo in festival
terms
Enter Beatrice
Beat Yea signior and depart when you bid me
Bene O stay but till then
me go with that I came for which is with knowing what hath
Bene Only foul words and thereupon I will kiss thee
Beat Foul words is but foul wind and foul wind is but foul
breath and foul breath is noisome Therefore I will depart
Bene Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense so
forcible is thy wit But I must tell thee plainly Claudio
undergoes my challenge and either I must shortly hear from him
or I will subscribe him a coward And I pray thee now tell me
for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me
evil that they will not admit any good part to intermingle with
them But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love
for me
love thee against my will
Beat In spite of your heart I think Alas poor heart If you
spite it for my sake I will spite it for yours for I will never
love that which my friend hates
Bene Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably
among twenty that will praise himself
good neighbours If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb
ere he dies he shall live no longer in monument than the bell
rings and the widow weeps
Beat And how long is that think you
Bene Question why an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum
of his own virtues as I am to myself So much for praising
myself who I myself will bear witness is praiseworthy And now
tell me how doth your cousin
Beat Very ill
Bene And how do you
Beat Very ill too
Bene Serve God love me and mend There will I leave you too for
here comes one in haste
Enter Ursula
who is fled and gone Will you come presently
Beat Will you go hear this news signior
Bene I will live in thy heart die in thy lap and be buried thy
Exeunt
Scene III
A churchyard
Enter Claudio Don Pedro and three or four with tapers
Claud Is this the monument of Leonato
Lord It is my lord
Epitaph
Done to death by slanderous tongues
Was the Hero that here lies
Death in guerdon of her wrongs
Gives her fame which never dies
So the life that died with shame
Lives in death with glorious fame
Hang thou there upon the tomb
Praising her when I am dumb
Now music sound and sing your solemn hymn
Song
Pardon goddess of the night
Those that slew thy virgin knight
For the which with songs of woe
Round about her tomb they go
Midnight assist our moan
Help us to sigh and groan
Heavily heavily
Graves yawn and yield your dead
Till death be uttered
Heavily heavily
Claud Now unto thy bones good night
Yearly will I do this rite
Pedro Good morrow masters Put your torches out
Before the wheels of Phoebus round about
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey
Thanks to you all and leave us Fare you well
Claud Good morrow masters Each his several way
Pedro Come let us hence and put on other weeds
Claud And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds
Scene IV
Friar Did I not tell you she was innocent
Upon the error that you heard debated
But Margaret was in some fault for this
Although against her will as it appears
In the true course of all the question
Ant Well I am glad that all things sort so well
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it
Leon Well daughter and you gentlewomen all
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves
Exeunt Ladies
To visit me You know your office brother
And give her to young Claudio
Bene Friar I must entreat your pains I think
Friar To do what signior
Signior Leonato truth it is good signior
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour
Bene And I do with an eye of love requite her
Leon The sight whereof I think you had from me
Bene Your answer sir is enigmatical
But for my will my will is your good will
In the state of honourable marriage
In which good friar I shall desire your help
Leon My heart is with your liking
Friar And my help
Enter Don Pedro and Claudio and two or three other
Here comes the Prince and Claudio
Pedro Good morrow to this fair assembly
Leon Good morrow Prince good morrow Claudio
That you have such a February face
So full of frost of storm and cloudiness
Claud I think he thinks upon the savage bull
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee
As once Europa did at lusty Jove
When he would play the noble beast in love
Bene Bull Jove sir had an amiable low
And got a calf in that same noble feat
Much like to you for you have just his bleat
Claud For this I owe you Here comes other reckonings
Which is the lady I must seize upon
Ant This same is she and I do give you her
Leon No that you shall not till you take her hand
Before this friar and swear to marry her
Claud Give me your hand before this holy friar
I am your husband if you like of me
Claud Another Hero
Hero Nothing certainer
And surely as I live I am a maid
Pedro The former Hero Hero that is dead
Friar All this amazement can I qualify
When after that the holy rites are ended
Meantime let wonder seem familiar
And to the chapel let us presently
Bene Soft and fair friar Which is Beatrice
Bene Do not you love me
Beat Why no no more than reason
Bene Why then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio
Have been deceived for they swore you did
Beat Do not you love me
Bene Troth no no more than reason
Beat Why then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
Bene They swore that you were almost sick for me
Beat No truly but in friendly recompense
Leon Come cousin I am sure you love the gentleman
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain
Containing her affection unto Benedick
Come I will have thee but by this light I take thee for pity
Beat I would not deny you but by this good day I yield upon
great persuasion and partly to save your life for I was told
you were in a consumption
flout me out of my humour Dost thou think I care for a satire or
wear nothing handsome about him In brief since I do purpose to
marry I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say
against it and therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it for man is a giddy thing and this is my conclusion
For thy part Claudio I did think to have beaten thee but in
cousin
not look exceeding narrowly to thee
Bene First of my word Therefore play music Prince thou art
sad Get thee a wife get thee a wife There is no staff more
Enter Messenger
And brought with armed men back to Messina
punishments for him Strike up pipers

SCENE Venice and Cyprus
ACT I SCENE I
Venice A street
Enter Roderigo and Iago
RODERIGO Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly
That thou Iago who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this
If ever I did dream of such a matter
Abhor me
IAGO Despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant
I know my price I am worth no worse a place
But he as loving his own pride and purposes
Evades them with a bumbast circumstance
And in conclusion
And what was he
Forsooth a great arithmetician
One Michael Cassio a Florentine
That never set a squadron in the field
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he Mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election
And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds
He in good time must his lieutenant be
RODERIGO By heaven I rather would have been his hangman
Preferment goes by letter and affection
And not by old gradation where each second
Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor
RODERIGO           I would not follow him then
IAGO O sir content you
I follow him to serve my turn upon him
We cannot all be masters nor all masters
That doting on his own obsequious bondage
Whip me such honest knaves Others there are
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves
And throwing but shows of service on their lords
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats
Do themselves homage These fellows have some soul
And such a one do I profess myself
For sir
It is as sure as you are Roderigo
Were I the Moor I would not be Iago
In following him I follow but myself
Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty
But seeming so for my peculiar end
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at I am not what I am
IAGO                     Call up her father
Rouse him make after him poison his delight
Proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen
And though he in a fertile climate dwell
Plague him with flies Though that his joy be joy
As it may lose some color
IAGO Do with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when by night and negligence the fire
Is spied in populous cities
RODERIGO What ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho
IAGO Awake What ho Brabantio Thieves Thieves Thieves
Look to your house your daughter and your bags
Thieves Thieves
Brabantio appears above at a window
BRABANTIO What is the reason of this terrible summons
What is the matter there
RODERIGO Signior is all your family within
BRABANTIO                   Why Wherefore ask you this
Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul
Even now now very now an old black ram
Is tupping your white ewe Arise arise
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you
Arise I say
BRABANTIO What have you lost your wits
RODERIGO Most reverend signior do you know my voice
BRABANTIO Not I What are you
RODERIGO My name is Roderigo
BRABANTIO                     The worser welcome
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
My daughter is not for thee and now in madness
Being full of supper and distempering draughts
Upon malicious bravery dost thou come
To start my quiet
BRABANTIO               But thou must needs be sure
My spirit and my place have in them power
To make this bitter to thee
RODERIGO                      Patience good sir
My house is not a grange
RODERIGO                   Most grave Brabantio
In simple and pure soul I come to you
if the devil bid you Because we come to do you service and you
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans
BRABANTIO What profane wretch art thou
IAGO I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the
Moor are now making the beast with two backs
BRABANTIO Thou are a villain
BRABANTIO This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo
RODERIGO Sir I will answer anything But I beseech you
As partly I find it is that your fair daughter
Transported with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire a gondolier
If this be known to you and your allowance
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs
But if you know not this my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe
That from the sense of all civility
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence
Your daughter if you have not given her leave
I say again hath made a gross revolt
Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and everywhere Straight satisfy yourself
If she be in her chamber or your house
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you
BRABANTIO               Strike on the tinder ho
Give me a taper Call up all my people
This accident is not unlike my dream
Belief of it oppresses me already
Light I say light                                  Exit above
IAGO                  Farewell for I must leave you
It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place
Against the Moor for I do know the state
However this may gall him with some check
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars
Which even now stands in act that for their souls
Another of his fathom they have none
To lead their business in which regard
Though I do hate him as I do hell pains
Yet for necessity of present life
I must show out a flag and sign of love
Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search
And there will I be with him So farewell                  Exit
Enter below Brabantio in his nightgown and
Servants with torches
BRABANTIO It is too true an evil gone she is
Is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo
Where didst thou see her O unhappy girl
Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers
Raise all my kindred Are they married think you
RODERIGO Truly I think they are
BRABANTIO O heaven How got she out O treason of the blood
By what you see them act Is there not charms
By which the property of youth and maidhood
May be abused Have you not read Roderigo
Of some such thing
RODERIGO             Yes sir I have indeed
BRABANTIO Call up my brother O would you had had her
Some one way some another Do you know
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor
RODERIGO I think I can discover him if you please
To get good guard and go along with me
I may command at most Get weapons ho
And raise some special officers of night
SCENE II
Another street
Enter Othello Iago and Attendants with torches
IAGO Though in the trade of war I have slain men
To do no contrived murther I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service Nine or ten times
IAGO                          Nay but he prated
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honor
That with the little godliness I have
I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir
Are you fast married Be assured of this
That the magnifico is much beloved
And hath in his effect a voice potential
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law with all his might to enforce it on
Will give him cable
OTHELLO               Let him do his spite
My services which I have done the signiory
Which when I know that boasting is an honor
From men of royal siege and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
But that I love the gentle Desdemona
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
IAGO Those are the raised father and his friends
You were best go in
OTHELLO               Not I I must be found
My parts my title and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly Is it they
IAGO By Janus I think no
Enter Cassio and certain Officers with torches
OTHELLO The servants of the Duke And my lieutenant
The goodness of the night upon you friends
What is the news
CASSIO             The Duke does greet you general
Even on the instant
OTHELLO               What is the matter think you
CASSIO Something from Cyprus as I may divine
It is a business of some heat The galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
And many of the consuls raised and met
When being not at your lodging to be found
The Senate hath sent about three several quests
To search you out
I will but spend a word here in the house
And go with you                                            Exit
CASSIO            Ancient what makes he here
IAGO Faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack
CASSIO I do not understand
CASSIO                                    To who
OTHELLO                                     Have with you
CASSIO Here comes another troop to seek for you
IAGO It is Brabantio General be advised
He comes to bad intent
Enter Brabantio Roderigo and Officers with torches
and weapons
OTHELLO                  Holla Stand there
RODERIGO Signior it is the Moor
BRABANTIO                         Down with him thief
They draw on both sides
IAGO You Roderigo Come sir I am for you
OTHELLO Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them
Good signior you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons
If she in chains of magic were not bound
Whether a maid so tender fair and happy
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation
Would ever have to incur a general mock
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
For an abuser of the world a practicer
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant
Lay hold upon him If he do resist
Subdue him at his peril
OTHELLO                   Hold your hands
Both you of my inclining and the rest
Were it my cue to fight I should have known it
Without a prompter Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge
BRABANTIO                    To prison till fit time
Of law and course of direct session
Call thee to answer
OTHELLO               What if I do obey
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied
Whose messengers are here about my side
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him
I am sure is sent for
BRABANTIO                How The Duke in council
In this time of the night Bring him away
Or any of my brothers of the state
For if such actions may have passage free
Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be            Exeunt
SCENE III
A council chamber The Duke and Senators sitting at a table
Officers attending
DUKE There is no composition in these news
That gives them credit
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys
DUKE And mine a hundred and forty
SECOND SENATOR                      And mine two hundred
As in these cases where the aim reports
A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus
DUKE Nay it is possible enough to judgement
I do not so secure me in the error
But the main article I do approve
In fearful sense
FIRST OFFICER A messenger from the galleys
Enter Sailor
SAILOR The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes
So was I bid report here to the state
By Signior Angelo
DUKE How say you by this change
FIRST SENATOR                    This cannot be
To keep us in false gaze When we consider
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk
And let ourselves again but understand
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes
So may he with more facile question bear it
For that it stands not in such warlike brace
But altogether lacks the abilities
We must not think the Turk is so unskillful
To leave that latest which concerns him first
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain
To wake and wage a danger profitless
FIRST OFFICER Here is more news
Enter a Messenger
MESSENGER The Ottomites reverend and gracious
Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes
Have there injointed them with an after fleet
FIRST SENATOR Ay so I thought How many as you guess
Their backward course bearing with frank appearance
Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano
Your trusty and most valiant servitor
With his free duty recommends you thus
And prays you to believe him
Marcus Luccicos is not he in town
FIRST SENATOR Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor
Enter Brabantio Othello Iago Roderigo and Officers
DUKE Valiant Othello we must straight employ you
Against the general enemy Ottoman
BRABANTIO So did I yours Good your Grace pardon me
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care
Take hold on me for my particular grief
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
And it is still itself
BRABANTIO My daughter O my daughter
ALL                                    Dead
BRABANTIO                                    Ay to me
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks
For nature so preposterously to err
Being not deficient blind or lame of sense
Sans witchcraft could not
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
And you of her the bloody book of law
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
After your own sense yea though our proper son
Stood in your action
BRABANTIO              Humbly I thank your Grace
Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems
Your special mandate for the state affairs
Hath hither brought
BRABANTIO Nothing but this is so
OTHELLO Most potent grave and reverend signiors
My very noble and approved good masters
It is most true true I have married her
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech
And little blest with the soft phrase of peace
Till now some nine moons wasted they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience
Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms
I won his daughter
BRABANTIO            A maiden never bold
Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion
That will confess perfection so could err
Against all rules of nature and must be driven
To find out practices of cunning hell
Why this should be I therefore vouch again
Or with some dram conjured to this effect
He wrought upon her
DUKE                  To vouch this is no proof
Without more certain and more overt test
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
Of modern seeming do prefer against him
FIRST SENATOR But Othello speak
Did you by indirect and forced courses
Or came it by request and such fair question
As soul to soul affordeth
OTHELLO                     I do beseech you
Send for the lady to the Sagittary
And let her speak of me before her father
If you do find me foul in her report
The trust the office I do hold of you
Not only take away but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life
DUKE                     Fetch Desdemona hither
OTHELLO Ancient conduct them you best know the place
Exeunt Iago and Attendants
And till she come as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood
And she in mine
DUKE Say it Othello
OTHELLO Her father loved me oft invited me
From year to year the battles sieges fortunes
I ran it through even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances
Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery of my redemption thence
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle
Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
And of the Cannibals that each other eat
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline
But still the house affairs would draw her thence
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch
Devour up my discourse which I observing
Took once a pliant hour and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate
Whereof by parcels she had something heard
But not intentively I did consent
And often did beguile her of her tears
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs
And bade me if I had a friend that loved her
I should but teach him how to tell my story
And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake
And I loved her that she did pity them
This only is the witchcraft I have used
Here comes the lady let her witness it
Enter Desdemona Iago and Attendants
DUKE I think this tale would win my daughter too
Good Brabantio
Take up this mangled matter at the best
Men do their broken weapons rather use
Than their bare hands
BRABANTIO               I pray you hear her speak
If she confess that she was half the wooer
Destruction on my head if my bad blame
Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress
Do you perceive in all this noble company
Where most you owe obedience
DESDEMONA                      My noble father
I do perceive here a divided duty
To you I am bound for life and education
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you you are the lord of duty
To you preferring you before her father
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord
BRABANTIO                  God be with you I have done
Please it your Grace on to the state affairs
I had rather to adopt a child than get it
Come hither Moor
I here do give thee that with all my heart
Which but thou hast already with all my heart
I would keep from thee For your sake jewel
I am glad at soul I have no other child
For thy escape would teach me tyranny
To hang clogs on them I have done my lord
DUKE Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence
Which as a grise or step may help these lovers
Into your favor
When remedies are past the griefs are ended
By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
Is the next way to draw new mischief on
What cannot be preserved when Fortune takes
Patience her injury a mockery makes
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief
BRABANTIO So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile
We lose it not so long as we can smile
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
But the free comfort which from thence he hears
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow
These sentences to sugar or to gall
Being strong on both sides are equivocal
But words are words I never yet did hear
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear
I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state
DUKE The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus
Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and
though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency
yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer
voice on you You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss
of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous
expedition
OTHELLO The tyrant custom most grave senators
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites
Most humbly therefore bending to your state
I crave fit disposition for my wife
Due reference of place and exhibition
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding
DUKE                          If you please
OTHELLO Nor I
DESDEMONA      Nor I I would not there reside
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye Most gracious Duke
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear
And let me find a charter in your voice
To assist my simpleness
DUKE What would you Desdemona
DESDEMONA That I did love the Moor to live with him
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
Even to the very quality of my lord
And to his honors and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate
So that dear lords if I be left behind
A moth of peace and he go to the war
The rites for which I love him are bereft me
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence Let me go with him
OTHELLO Let her have your voices
Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not
To please the palate of my appetite
But to be free and bounteous to her mind
And heaven defend your good souls that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
My speculative and officed instruments
That my disports corrupt and taint my business
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation
DUKE Be it as you shall privately determine
Either for her stay or going The affair cries haste
DESDEMONA Tonight my lord
DUKE                        This night
OTHELLO                                 With all my heart
Othello leave some officer behind
And he shall our commission bring to you
With such things else of quality and respect
As doth import you
OTHELLO              So please your Grace my ancient
A man he is of honesty and trust
To his conveyance I assign my wife
With what else needful your good Grace shall think
To be sent after me
DUKE                  Let it be so
If virtue no delighted beauty lack
FIRST SENATOR Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well
BRABANTIO Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see
She has deceived her father and may thee
Exeunt Duke Senators and Officers
OTHELLO My life upon her faith Honest Iago
My Desdemona must I leave to thee
I prithee let thy wife attend on her
And bring them after in the best advantage
Come Desdemona I have but an hour
Of love of worldly matters and direction
To spend with thee We must obey the time
Exeunt Othello and Desdemona
RODERIGO Iago
RODERIGO What will I do thinkest thou
IAGO Why go to bed and sleep
RODERIGO I will incontinently drown myself
IAGO If thou dost I shall never love thee after
Why thou silly gentleman
RODERIGO It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then
have we a prescription to die when death is our physician
IAGO O villainous I have looked upon the world for four times
seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and
an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I
would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen I
would change my humanity with a baboon
RODERIGO What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond
but it is not in my virtue to amend it
Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so
that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed
up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with
many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with
industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in
our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of
reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of
our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions
But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings
our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to
be a sect or scion
RODERIGO It cannot be
IAGO It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the
will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind
puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to
thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never
better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou
the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard I say put
money in thy purse It cannot be that Desdemona should long
to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an
food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him
shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth
when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her
choice She must have change she must therefore put money in
thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate
way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony
and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle
Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell
thyself It is clean out of the way Seek thou rather to be
hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without
her
RODERIGO Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue
and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is
hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our
revenge against him If thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself
a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time
which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will
have more of this tomorrow Adieu
IAGO At my lodging
IAGO Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo
RODERIGO What say you
IAGO No more of drowning do you hear
IAGO Thus do I ever make my fool my purse
If I would time expend with such a snipe
But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor
But I for mere suspicion in that kind
Will do as if for surety He holds me well
The better shall my purpose work on him
To get his place and to plume up my will
That he is too familiar with his wife
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
The Moor is of a free and open nature
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are

ACT II SCENE I
A seaport in Cyprus An open place near the quay
Enter Montano and two Gentlemen
MONTANO What from the cape can you discern at sea
Descry a sail
MONTANO Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land
What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them
Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this
SECOND GENTLEMAN A segregation of the Turkish fleet
For do but stand upon the foaming shore
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds
Seems to cast water on the burning bear
I never did like molestation view
On the enchafed flood
MONTANO                 If that the Turkish fleet
It is impossible to bear it out
Enter a third Gentleman
THIRD GENTLEMAN News lads Our wars are done
That their designment halts A noble ship of Venice
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
On most part of their fleet
MONTANO How Is this true
THIRD GENTLEMAN            The ship is here put in
A Veronesa Michael Cassio
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello
Is come on shore the Moor himself at sea
And is in full commission here for Cyprus
THIRD GENTLEMAN But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort
Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly
And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted
With foul and violent tempest
MONTANO                         Pray heavens he be
For I have served him and the man commands
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
An indistinct regard
For every minute is expectancy
Of more arrivance
Enter Cassio
CASSIO Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle
That so approve the Moor O let the heavens
Give him defense against the elements
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea
Of very expert and approved allowance
Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death
Stand in bold cure
Enter a fourth Gentleman
What noise
CASSIO My hopes do shape him for the governor
Guns heard
Our friends at least
CASSIO                 I pray you sir go forth
SECOND GENTLEMAN I shall                                    Exit
MONTANO But good lieutenant is your general wived
CASSIO Most fortunately he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener
How now who has put in
CASSIO He has had most favorable and happy speed
Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds
As having sense of beauty do omit
Their mortal natures letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona
MONTANO                What is she
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship
And bring all Cyprus comfort
Enter Desdemona Emilia Iago Roderigo and Attendants
O behold
The riches of the ship is come on shore
Ye men of Cyprus let her have your knees
Hall to thee lady And the grace of heaven
Before behind thee and on every hand
Enwheel thee round
DESDEMONA            I thank you valiant Cassio
What tidings can you tell me of my lord
CASSIO He is not yet arrived nor know I aught
CASSIO The great contention of the sea and skies
SECOND GENTLEMAN They give their greeting to the citadel
This likewise is a friend
CASSIO                      See for the news
Exit Gentleman
Let it not gall your patience good Iago
That gives me this bold show of courtesy             Kisses her
IAGO Sir would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me
DESDEMONA            Alas she has no speech
IAGO In faith too much
I find it still when I have list to sleep
Marry before your ladyship I grant
She puts her tongue a little in her heart
And chides with thinking
EMILIA You have little cause to say so
IAGO Come on come on You are pictures out of doors
Bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens
Saints in your injuries devils being offended
Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds
DESDEMONA O fie upon thee slanderer
IAGO Nay it is true or else I am a Turk
You rise to play and go to bed to work
EMILIA You shall not write my praise
IAGO                                  No let me not
DESDEMONA What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst
praise me
For I am nothing if not critical
IAGO Ay madam
DESDEMONA I am not merry but I do beguile
The thing I am by seeming otherwise
Come how wouldst thou praise me
IAGO I am about it but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze
It plucks out brains and all But my Muse labors
If she be fair and wise fairness and wit
DESDEMONA Well praised How if she be black and witty
IAGO If she be black and thereto have a wit
DESDEMONA Worse and worse
EMILIA How if fair and foolish
IAGO She never yet was foolish that was fair
foolish
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do
DESDEMONA O heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best But what
praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that
in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very
malice itself
IAGO She that was ever fair and never proud
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly
She that in wisdom never was so frail
See suitors following and not look behind
DESDEMONA To do what
IAGO To suckle fools and chronicle small beer
DESDEMONA O most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn of him
Emilia though he be thy husband How say you Cassio Is he not
a most profane and liberal counselor
CASSIO He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the
soldier than in the scholar
With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as
Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own
strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had
not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are
most apt to play the sir in Very good Well kissed an excellent
The Moor I know his trumpet
CASSIO Lo where he comes
Enter Othello and Attendants
OTHELLO O my fair warrior
DESDEMONA                  My dear Othello
OTHELLO It gives me wonder great as my content
If after every tempest come such calms
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate
DESDEMONA                  The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase
Even as our days do grow
OTHELLO                    Amen to that sweet powers
I cannot speak enough of this content
It stops me here it is too much of joy
And this and this the greatest discords be          Kisses her
As honest as I am
OTHELLO             Come let us to the castle
How does my old acquaintance of this isle
Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus
I have found great love amongst them O my sweet
I prattle out of fashion and I dote
In mine own comforts I prithee good Iago
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers
Bring thou the master to the citadel
He is a good one and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona
Once more well met at Cyprus
Exeunt all but Iago and Roderigo
IAGO Do thou meet me presently at the harbor Come hither If thou
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard First I
must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him
IAGO Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me
with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and
telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for
prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be
fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil When
the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be
again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite
all which the Moor is defective in Now for want of these
required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself
abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor
very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second
fortune as Cassio does A knave very voluble no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane
seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose
finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present
and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds
him already
condition
she had been blest she would never have loved the Moor Blest
pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand
Didst not mark that
RODERIGO Yes that I did but that was but courtesy
IAGO Lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the
history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their
lips that their breaths embraced together Villainous thoughts
Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand
comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion
Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from
occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or
tainting his discipline or from what other course you please
which the time shall more favorably minister
RODERIGO Well
IAGO Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may
strike at you Provoke him that he may for even out of that
will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall
come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio
So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means
I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most
profitably removed without the which there were no expectation
of our prosperity
RODERIGO I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity
IAGO I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must
fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell
RODERIGO Adieu                                              Exit
IAGO That Cassio loves her I do well believe it
The Moor howbeit that I endure him not
Is of a constant loving noble nature
A most dear husband Now I do love her too
Not out of absolute lust though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin
But partly led to diet my revenge
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Or failing so yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgement cannot cure Which thing to do
If this poor trash of Venice whom I trace
For his quick hunting stand the putting on
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb
Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me
For making him egregiously an ass
And practicing upon his peace and quiet
SCENE II
A street
Enter a Herald with a proclamation people following
that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere
perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into
triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what
sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these
beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial So much
was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and
there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus
and our noble general Othello                            Exeunt
SCENE III
A hall in the castle
Enter Othello Desdemona Cassio and Attendants
OTHELLO Good Michael look you to the guard tonight
Not to outsport discretion
CASSIO Iago hath direction what to do
But notwithstanding with my personal eye
OTHELLO            Iago is most honest
Michael good night Tomorrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you Come my dear love
The purchase made the fruits are to ensue
Good night
Exeunt Othello Desdemona and Attendants
Enter Iago
CASSIO Welcome Iago we must to the watch
general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let
us not therefore blame He hath not yet made wanton the night
with her and she is sport for Jove
IAGO What an eye she has Methinks it sounds a parley to
provocation
CASSIO An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest
IAGO And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love
CASSIO She is indeed perfection
IAGO Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a
stope of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants
that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello
CASSIO Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains
for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other
custom of entertainment
CASSIO I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily
qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am
unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with
any more
CASSIO Where are they
IAGO Here at the door I pray you call them in
IAGO If I can fasten but one cup upon him
With that which he hath drunk tonight already
To Desdemona hath tonight caroused
Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits
That hold their honors in a wary distance
The very elements of this warlike isle
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle But here they come
If consequence do but approve my dream
My boat sails freely both with wind and stream
Servants following with wine
MONTANO Good faith a little one not past a pint as I am a
soldier
IAGO Some wine ho
And let me the canakin clink
Some wine boys
IAGO I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in
CASSIO Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking
IAGO Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he
sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a
vomit ere the next pottle can be filled
CASSIO To the health of our general
IAGO O sweet England
His breeches cost him but a crown
He held them sixpence all too dear
And thou art but of low degree
Some wine ho
CASSIO Why this is a more exquisite song than the other
CASSIO No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does
saved and there be souls must not be saved
IAGO And so do I too lieutenant
CASSIO Ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to
our business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my
ancient this is my right hand and this is my left I am not
drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enough
ALL Excellent well
CASSIO Why very well then you must not think then that I am
drunk                                                      Exit
IAGO You see this fellow that is gone before
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction And do but see his vice
I fear the trust Othello puts him in
On some odd time of his infirmity
Will shake this island
MONTANO                  But is he often thus
If drink rock not his cradle
MONTANO                        It were well
The general were put in mind of it
Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio
And looks not on his evils Is not this true
Enter Roderigo
I pray you after the lieutenant go              Exit Roderigo
Should hazard such a place as his own second
With one of an ingraft infirmity
It were an honest action to say
So to the Moor
IAGO             Not I for this fair island
I do love Cassio well and would do much
twiggen bottle
RODERIGO Beat me
CASSIO Dost thou prate rogue                   Strikes Roderigo
MONTANO Nay good lieutenant I pray you sir hold your hand
CASSIO Drunk                                          They fight
Exit Roderigo
A bell rings
You will be shamed forever
OTHELLO                      What is the matter here
Faints
OTHELLO Hold for your lives
Have you forgot all place of sense and duty
Hold the general speaks to you Hold hold for shame
OTHELLO Why how now ho from whence ariseth this
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites
For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion
Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle
From her propriety What is the matter masters
Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee
IAGO I do not know Friends all but now even now
In quarter and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed and then but now
In opposition bloody I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it
OTHELLO How comes it Michael you are thus forgot
CASSIO I pray you pardon me I cannot speak
OTHELLO Worthy Montano you were wont be civil
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted and your name is great
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
MONTANO Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger
Of all that I do know Nor know I aught
And to defend ourselves it be a sin
When violence assails us
OTHELLO                    Now by heaven
My blood begins my safer guides to rule
And passion having my best judgement collied
Assays to lead the way If I once stir
Or do but lift this arm the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know
How this foul rout began who set it on
And he that is approved in this offense
Shall lose me What in a town of war
To manage private and domestic quarrel
In night and on the court and guard of safety
MONTANO If partially affined or leagued in office
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth
Thou art no soldier
IAGO                  Touch me not so near
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general
Montano and myself being in speech
There comes a fellow crying out for help
And Cassio following him with determined sword
To execute upon him Sir this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause
Myself the crying fellow did pursue
The town might fall in fright He swift of foot
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords
And Cassio high in oath which till tonight
At blow and thrust even as again they were
When you yourself did part them
More of this matter cannot I report
But men are men the best sometimes forget
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him
As men in rage strike those that wish them best
Yet surely Cassio I believe received
From him that fled some strange indignity
Which patience could not pass
OTHELLO                         I know Iago
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter
Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee
But never more be officer of mine
Look if my gentle love be not raised up
Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon
Lead him off                             Exit Montano attended
Iago look with care about the town
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife
Exeunt all but Iago and Cassio
IAGO What are you hurt lieutenant
CASSIO Ay past all surgery
IAGO Marry heaven forbid
CASSIO Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my
reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what
remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation
IAGO As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily
wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation
is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and
lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all
unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are
ways to recover the general again You are but now cast in his
mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one
would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion Sue
CASSIO I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a
commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an
officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear
spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call
thee devil
IAGO What was he that you followed with your sword
What had he done to you
CASSIO I know not
CASSIO I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a
quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an
enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should
with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves
into beasts
IAGO Why but you are now well enough How came you thus
recovered
CASSIO It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the
devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me
frankly despise myself
IAGO Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place
and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish
this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your
own good
CASSIO I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a
drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would
stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and
presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblest
and the ingredient is a devil
IAGO Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be
well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I
think you think I love you
CASSIO I have well approved it sir I drunk
general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted
and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement
of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her
importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so
free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a
vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This
broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter
and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your
love shall grow stronger than it was before
CASSIO You advise me well
IAGO I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness
CASSIO I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech
the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my
fortunes if they check me here
IAGO You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the
watch
CASSIO Good night honest Iago                              Exit
When this advice is free I give and honest
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
As the free elements And then for her
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin
That she may make unmake do what she list
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course
Directly to his good Divinity of hell
When devils will the blackest sins put on
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows
As I do now For whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor
And by how much she strives to do him good
She shall undo her credit with the Moor
So will I turn her virtue into pitch
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all
Enter Roderigo
How now Roderigo
RODERIGO I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that
hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I
have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think the
issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and
so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to
Venice
IAGO How poor are they that have not patience
What wound did ever heal but by degrees
And wit depends on dilatory time
Though other things grow fair against the sun
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short
Retire thee go where thou art billeted
Away I say Thou shalt know more hereafter
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Dull not device by coldness and delay                      Exit

May be more free
A Florentine more kind and honest
Enter Emilia
EMILIA Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry
For your displeasure but all will sure be well
The general and his wife are talking of it
And she speaks for you stoutly The Moor replies
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus
And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again
CASSIO                  Yet I beseech you
If you think fit or that it may be done
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone
EMILIA                 Pray you come in
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely
CASSIO                       I am much bound to you
Exeunt
SCENE II
A room in the castle
Enter Othello Iago and Gentlemen
OTHELLO These letters give Iago to the pilot
And by him do my duties to the Senate
That done I will be walking on the works
Repair there to me
SCENE III
The garden of the castle
Enter Desdemona Cassio and Emilia
DESDEMONA Be thou assured good Cassio I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf
EMILIA Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband
As if the cause were his
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were
CASSIO                    Bounteous madam
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio
You have known him long and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
Than in a politic distance
CASSIO                       Ay but lady
That policy may either last so long
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet
Or breed itself so out of circumstances
That I being absent and my place supplied
My general will forget my love and service
DESDEMONA Do not doubt that Before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place assure thee
To the last article My lord shall never rest
His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away
Enter Othello and Iago at a distance
EMILIA Madam here comes my lord
DESDEMONA Nay stay and hear me speak
CASSIO Madam not now I am very ill at ease
Unfit for mine own purposes
DESDEMONA Well do your discretion                   Exit Cassio
IAGO Ha I like not that
OTHELLO What dost thou say
OTHELLO Was not that Cassio parted from my wife
IAGO Cassio my lord No sure I cannot think it
Seeing you coming
DESDEMONA How now my lord
I have been talking with a suitor here
A man that languishes in your displeasure
DESDEMONA Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord
If I have any grace or power to move you
His present reconciliation take
For if he be not one that truly loves you
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning
I have no judgement in an honest face
I prithee call him back
OTHELLO                    Went he hence now
DESDEMONA Ay sooth so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me
To suffer with him Good love call him back
OTHELLO Not now sweet Desdemona some other time
OTHELLO                           The sooner sweet for you
OTHELLO                                 No not tonight
DESDEMONA Tomorrow dinner then
OTHELLO                         I shall not dine at home
I meet the captains at the citadel
DESDEMONA Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn
On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn
I prithee name the time but let it not
Save that they say the wars must make example
To incur a private check When shall he come
Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul
What you would ask me that I should deny
Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio
That came awooing with you and so many a time
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly
OTHELLO Prithee no more Let him come when he will
I will deny thee nothing
DESDEMONA                  Why this is not a boon
Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person Nay when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted
OTHELLO                     I will deny thee nothing
Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this
To leave me but a little to myself
DESDEMONA Shall I deny you No Farewell my lord
DESDEMONA Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia
OTHELLO Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul
But I do love thee and when I love thee not
Chaos is come again
OTHELLO             What dost thou say Iago
Know of your love
OTHELLO He did from first to last Why dost thou ask
IAGO But for a satisfaction of my thought
No further harm
OTHELLO           Why of thy thought Iago
IAGO I did not think he had been acquainted with her
OTHELLO O yes and went between us very oft
IAGO Indeed
Is he not honest
IAGO Honest my lord
OTHELLO Honest Ay honest
IAGO My lord for aught I know
OTHELLO What dost thou think
IAGO Think my lord
OTHELLO Think my lord By heaven he echoes me
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something
When Cassio left my wife What didst not like
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
And didst contract and purse thy brow together
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit If thou dost love me
Show me thy thought
IAGO My lord you know I love you
OTHELLO                            I think thou dost
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more
For such things in a false disloyal knave
That passion cannot rule
IAGO                       For Michael Cassio
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest
OTHELLO I think so too
IAGO                    Men should be what they seem
Or those that be not would they might seem none
OTHELLO Certain men should be what they seem
I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings
As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words
IAGO                 Good my lord pardon me
Though I am bound to every act of duty
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to
Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false
Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure
But some uncleanly apprehensions
With meditations lawful
OTHELLO Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago
A stranger to thy thoughts
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy
From one that so imperfectly conceits
Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance
It were not for your quiet nor your good
Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom
To let you know my thoughts
OTHELLO                       What dost thou mean
IAGO Good name in man and woman dear my lord
Is the immediate jewel of their souls
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed
IAGO You cannot if my heart were in your hand
OTHELLO Ha
IAGO        O beware my lord of jealousy
The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss
Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger
Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves
OTHELLO O misery
IAGO Poor and content is rich and rich enough
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor
Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy
OTHELLO         Why why is this
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises
To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company
Is free of speech sings plays and dances well
Where virtue is these are more virtuous
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt
For she had eyes and chose me No Iago
Away at once with love or jealousy
IAGO I am glad of it for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound
Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof
Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio
Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure
I would not have your free and noble nature
I know our country disposition well
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands their best conscience
OTHELLO Dost thou say so
IAGO She did deceive her father marrying you
She loved them most
OTHELLO               And so she did
IAGO                                  Why go to then
She that so young could give out such a seeming
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you
OTHELLO                   I am bound to thee forever
OTHELLO Not a jot not a jot
I hope you will consider what is spoke
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion
OTHELLO I will not
IAGO                Should you do so my lord
My speech should fall into such vile success
OTHELLO                       No not much moved
IAGO Long live she so and long live you to think so
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime complexion and degree
Foh one may smell in such a will most rank
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural
But pardon me I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her though I may fear
Her will recoiling to her better judgement
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent
OTHELLO              Farewell farewell
If more thou dost perceive let me know more
Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago
OTHELLO Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds
To scan this thing no further leave it to time
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place
For sure he fills it up with great ability
Yet if you please to hold him off awhile
You shall by that perceive him and his means
Note if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity
Much will be seen in that In the meantime
And hold her free I do beseech your honor
OTHELLO Fear not my government
IAGO I once more take my leave                              Exit
And knows all qualities with a learned spirit
Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings
To prey at fortune Haply for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have or for I am declined
Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage
That we can call these delicate creatures ours
And not their appetites I had rather be a toad
And live upon the vapor of a dungeon
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
Prerogatived are they less than the base
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken Desdemona comes
If she be false O then heaven mocks itself
DESDEMONA            How now my dear Othello
Your dinner and the generous islanders
By you invited do attend your presence
OTHELLO I am to blame
DESDEMONA              Why do you speak so faintly
Are you not well
OTHELLO I have a pain upon my forehead here
Let me but bind it hard within this hour
It will be well
OTHELLO           Your napkin is too little
He puts the handkerchief from him and she drops it
DESDEMONA I am very sorry that you are not well
Exeunt Othello and Desdemona
EMILIA I am glad I have found this napkin
This was her first remembrance from the Moor
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
For he conjured her she should ever keep it
That she reserves it evermore about her
Heaven knows not I
I nothing but to please his fantasy
IAGO How now what do you here alone
EMILIA Do not you chide I have a thing for you
EMILIA Ha
IAGO To have a foolish wife
EMILIA O is that all What will you give me now
For that same handkerchief
IAGO                         What handkerchief
EMILIA What handkerchief
Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona
That which so often you did bid me steal
EMILIA No faith she let it drop by negligence
Look here it is
IAGO               A good wench give it me
To have me filch it
When she shall lack it
Go leave me                                        Exit Emilia
And let him find it Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ this may do something
The Moor already changes with my poison
Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste
But with a little act upon the blood
Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so
Look where he comes
Not poppy nor mandragora
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday
OTHELLO                       Ha ha false to me
IAGO Why how now general No more of that
OTHELLO Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack
IAGO                          How now my lord
I slept the next night well was free and merry
IAGO I am sorry to hear this
OTHELLO I had been happy if the general camp
Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body
So I had nothing known O now forever
Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content
Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars
That make ambition virtue O farewell
Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump
The royal banner and all quality
Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war
And O you mortal engines whose rude throats
OTHELLO Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore
Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life
OTHELLO If thou dost slander her and torture me
Never pray more abandon all remorse
Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that
IAGO                O grace O heaven defend me
Are you a man have you a soul or sense
That livest to make thine honesty a vice
O monstrous world Take note take note O world
To be direct and honest is not safe
I thank you for this profit and from hence
OTHELLO Nay stay thou shouldst be honest
And loses that it works for
OTHELLO                       By the world
I think my wife be honest and think she is not
I think that thou art just and think thou art not
As mine own face If there be cords or knives
Poison or fire or suffocating streams
IAGO I see sir you are eaten up with passion
I do repent me that I put it to you
You would be satisfied
OTHELLO                  Would Nay I will
IAGO And may But how how satisfied my lord
Would you the supervisor grossly gape on
OTHELLO             Death and damnation O
IAGO It were a tedious difficulty I think
To bring them to that prospect Damn them then
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own What then how then
It is impossible you should see this
Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys
As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk But yet I say
If imputation and strong circumstances
Which lead directly to the door of truth
IAGO I do not like the office
I will go on I lay with Cassio lately
And being troubled with a raging tooth
I could not sleep
There are a kind of men so loose of soul
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs
One of this kind is Cassio
And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand
That grew upon my lips then laid his leg
OTHELLO O monstrous monstrous
IAGO                            Nay this was but his dream
OTHELLO But this denoted a foregone conclusion
IAGO And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly
IAGO Nay but be wise yet we see nothing done
She may be honest yet Tell me but this
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
See Cassio wipe his beard with
IAGO If it be that or any that was hers
It speaks against her with the other proofs
OTHELLO O that the slave had forty thousand lives
One is too poor too weak for my revenge
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven
Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell
Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught
IAGO                          Yet be content
OTHELLO O blood blood blood
IAGO Patience I say your mind perhaps may change
OTHELLO Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea
Whose icy current and compulsive course
To the Propontic and the Hellespont
Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven
In the due reverence of a sacred vow                      Kneels
I here engage my words
IAGO                     Do not rise yet                  Kneels
You elements that clip us round about
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit hands heart
And to obey shall be in me remorse
What bloody business ever                             They rise
OTHELLO                     I greet thy love
Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous
Within these three days let me hear thee say
But let her live
OTHELLO            Damn her lewd minx O damn her
Come go with me apart I will withdraw
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant
IAGO I am your own forever                                Exeunt
SCENE IV
Before the castle
Enter Desdemona Emilia and Clown
DESDEMONA Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies
CLOWN I dare not say he lies anywhere
DESDEMONA Why man
stabbing
DESDEMONA Go to Where lodges he
CLOWN To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie
DESDEMONA Can anything be made of this
CLOWN I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging
and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own
throat
DESDEMONA Can you inquire him out and be edified by report
CLOWN I will catechize the world for him that is make questions
and by them answer
DESDEMONA Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my
lord on his behalf and hope all will be well
I will attempt the doing it                                Exit
DESDEMONA Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia
EMILIA I know not madam
DESDEMONA Believe me I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are it were enough
To put him to ill thinking
EMILIA                       Is he not jealous
DESDEMONA Who he I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humors from him
EMILIA                          Look where he comes
DESDEMONA I will not leave him now till Cassio
Enter Othello
How do you Desdemona
DESDEMONA               Well my good lord
OTHELLO Give me your hand This hand is moist my lady
DESDEMONA It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow
OTHELLO This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart
Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer
Much castigation exercise devout
A frank one
DESDEMONA You may indeed say so
OTHELLO A liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands
But our new heraldry is hands not hearts
DESDEMONA I cannot speak of this Come now your promise
OTHELLO What promise chuck
DESDEMONA I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you
OTHELLO I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me
Lend me thy handkerchief
DESDEMONA Here my lord
OTHELLO That which I gave you
DESDEMONA I have it not about me
OTHELLO Not
DESDEMONA No faith my lord
Did an Egyptian to my mother give
She was a charmer and could almost read
The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it
Entirely to her love but if she lost it
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies She dying gave it me
And bid me when my fate would have me wive
Make it a darling like your precious eye
As nothing else could match
The sun to course two hundred compasses
And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful
OTHELLO Ha wherefore
DESDEMONA Why do you speak so startingly and rash
DESDEMONA Heaven bless us
OTHELLO Say you
DESDEMONA It is not lost but what an if it were
OTHELLO How
DESDEMONA I say it is not lost
DESDEMONA Why so I can sir but I will not now
This is a trick to put me from my suit
Pray you let Cassio be received again
OTHELLO Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives
DESDEMONA Come come
OTHELLO The handkerchief
DESDEMONA                 I pray talk me of Cassio
OTHELLO The handkerchief
DESDEMONA                 A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love
OTHELLO The handkerchief
DESDEMONA In sooth you are to blame
OTHELLO Away                                                Exit
EMILIA Is not this man jealous
I am most unhappy in the loss of it
They are all but stomachs and we all but food
They eat us hungerly and when they are full
They belch us Look you Cassio and my husband
Enter Cassio and Iago
And lo the happiness Go and importune her
CASSIO Madam my former suit I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
If my offense be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past nor present sorrows
Nor purposed merit in futurity
Can ransom me into his love again
But to know so must be my benefit
So shall I clothe me in a forced content
And shut myself up in some other course
My advocation is not now in tune
My lord is not my lord nor should I know him
So help me every spirit sanctified
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech You must awhile be patient
What I can do I will and more I will
Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you
IAGO Is my lord angry
EMILIA                 He went hence but now
And certainly in strange unquietness
IAGO Can he be angry I have seen the cannon
When it hath blown his ranks into the air
And like the devil from his very arm
Something of moment then I will go meet him
DESDEMONA I prithee do so                             Exit Iago
Something sure of state
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him
Hath puddled his clear spirit and in such cases
For let our finger ache and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain Nay we must think men are not gods
Nor of them look for such observancy
As fits the bridal Beshrew me much Emilia
I was unhandsome warrior as I am
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul
EMILIA Pray heaven it be state matters as you think
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you
DESDEMONA Alas the day I never gave him cause
They are not ever jealous for the cause
Begot upon itself born on itself
EMILIA Lady amen
DESDEMONA I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout
And seek to effect it to my uttermost
CASSIO I humbly thank your ladyship
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia
Enter Bianca
BIANCA Save you friend Cassio
CASSIO                          What make you from home
How is it with you my most fair Bianca
BIANCA And I was going to your lodging Cassio
What keep a week away seven days and nights
More tedious than the dial eight score times
O weary reckoning
CASSIO              Pardon me Bianca
But I shall in a more continuate time
Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca
Take me this work out
BIANCA                  O Cassio whence came this
This is some token from a newer friend
To the felt absence now I feel a cause
CASSIO                          Go to woman
From whence you have them You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress some remembrance
No by my faith Bianca
BIANCA                    Why whose is it
CASSIO I know not sweet I found it in my chamber
BIANCA Leave you wherefore
CASSIO I do attend here on the general
And think it no addition nor my wish
BIANCA                       Why I pray you
CASSIO Not that I love you not
BIANCA                          But that you do not love me
I pray you bring me on the way a little
And say if I shall see you soon at night

ACT IV SCENE I
Cyprus Before the castle
Enter Othello and Iago
IAGO Will you think so
OTHELLO                 Think so Iago
IAGO                                    What
To kiss in private
OTHELLO              An unauthorized kiss
IAGO Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more not meaning any harm
OTHELLO Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm
It is hypocrisy against the devil
They that mean virtuously and yet do so
The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven
OTHELLO What then
OTHELLO She is protectress of her honor too
May she give that
They have it very oft that have it not
OTHELLO By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it
IAGO Ay what of that
IAGO                                           What
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong
Who having by their own importunate suit
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress
Convinced or supplied them cannot choose
OTHELLO              Hath he said anything
IAGO He hath my lord but be you well assured
OTHELLO                      What hath he said
OTHELLO What what
OTHELLO With her
IAGO              With her on her what you will
OTHELLO Lie with her lie on her We say lie on her when they
first to be hanged and then to confess I tremble at it
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without
some instruction It is not words that shakes me thus Pish
devil
Falls in a trance
IAGO Work on
My medicine work Thus credulous fools are caught
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus
All guiltless meet reproach What ho My lord
My lord I say Othello
Enter Cassio
How now Cassio
This is his second fit he had one yesterday
CASSIO Rub him about the temples
IAGO                              No forbear
The lethargy must have his quiet course
If not he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs
Do you withdraw yourself a little while
He will recover straight When he is gone
I would on great occasion speak with you            Exit Cassio
How is it general Have you not hurt your head
OTHELLO Dost thou mock me
IAGO                       I mock you No by heaven
Would you would bear your fortune like a man
And many a civil monster
OTHELLO Did he confess it
IAGO                       Good sir be a man
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar Your case is better
To lip a wanton in a secure couch
And to suppose her chaste No let me know
And knowing what I am I know what she shall be
IAGO                                    Stand you awhile apart
Confine yourself but in a patient list
Cassio came hither I shifted him away
Bade him anon return and here speak with me
The which he promised Do but encave yourself
And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns
That dwell in every region of his face
For I will make him tell the tale anew
Where how how oft how long ago and when
He hath and is again to cope your wife
I say but mark his gesture Marry patience
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen
And nothing of a man
OTHELLO                Dost thou hear Iago
I will be found most cunning in my patience
But yet keep time in all Will you withdraw
Othello retires
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes It is a creature
To beguile many and be beguiled by one
He when he hears of her cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter Here he comes
As he shall smile Othello shall go mad
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Quite in the wrong How do you now lieutenant
CASSIO The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me
How quickly should you speed
CASSIO                         Alas poor caitiff
OTHELLO Look how he laughs already
IAGO I never knew a woman love man so
OTHELLO Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out
IAGO Do you hear Cassio
OTHELLO                   Now he importunes him
IAGO She gives it out that you shall marry her
Do you intend it
CASSIO Ha ha ha
OTHELLO Do you triumph Roman Do you triumph
CASSIO I marry her What A customer I prithee bear some charity
to my wit do not think it so unwholesome Ha ha ha
OTHELLO So so so so They laugh that win
IAGO Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her
CASSIO Prithee say true
IAGO I am a very villain else
OTHELLO Have you scored me Well
will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my
promise
OTHELLO Iago beckons me now he begins the story
CASSIO She was here even now she haunts me in every place I was
the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians and
thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus
CASSIO So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls
me Ha ha ha
OTHELLO Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O I see
that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to
CASSIO Well I must leave her company
IAGO Before me look where she comes
Enter Bianca
What do you mean by this haunting of me
BIANCA Let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you mean by
that same handkerchief you gave me even now I was a fine fool to
take it I must take out the work A likely piece of work that
you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it
CASSIO How now my sweet Bianca how now how now
OTHELLO By heaven that should be my handkerchief
come when you are next prepared for                        Exit
IAGO After her after her
IAGO Will you sup there
CASSIO Faith I intend so
IAGO Well I may chance to see you for I would very fain speak
with you
CASSIO Prithee come will you
IAGO Go to say no more                              Exit Cassio
IAGO Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice
OTHELLO O Iago
IAGO And did you see the handkerchief
OTHELLO Was that mine
IAGO Yours by this hand And to see how he prizes the foolish
woman your wife She gave it him and he hath given it his whore
OTHELLO I would have him nine years akilling A fine woman a fair
woman a sweet woman
IAGO Nay you must forget that
OTHELLO Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for
she shall not live No my heart is turned to stone I strike it
and it hurts my hand O the world hath not a sweeter creature
OTHELLO Hang her I do but say what she is So delicate with her
needle an admirable musician O she will sing the savageness
OTHELLO O a thousand a thousand times And then of so gentle a
condition
IAGO Ay too gentle
O Iago the pity of it Iago
IAGO If you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to
offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody
OTHELLO I will chop her into messes Cuckold me
OTHELLO With mine officer
with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This
night Iago
IAGO Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed
she hath contaminated
OTHELLO Good good the justice of it pleases very good
IAGO And for Cassio let me be his undertaker You shall hear more
by midnight
same
Come from the Duke And see your wife is with him
Enter Lodovico Desdemona and Attendants
LODOVICO God save the worthy general
OTHELLO                               With all my heart sir
LODOVICO The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you
Gives him a letter
OTHELLO I kiss the instrument of their pleasures
Opens the letter and reads
IAGO I am very glad to see you signior
Welcome to Cyprus
LODOVICO I thank you How does Lieutenant Cassio
IAGO Lives sir
An unkind breech but you shall make all well
OTHELLO Are you sure of that
DESDEMONA My lord
DESDEMONA A most unhappy one I would do much
To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio
OTHELLO Fire and brimstone
DESDEMONA My lord
OTHELLO Are you wise
DESDEMONA What is he angry
LODOVICO                     May be the letter moved him
For as I think they do command him home
Deputing Cassio in his government
OTHELLO                                Indeed
DESDEMONA                                      My lord
OTHELLO I am glad to see you mad
DESDEMONA                         Why sweet Othello
OTHELLO Devil                                        Strikes her
DESDEMONA I have not deserved this
LODOVICO My lord this would not be believed in Venice
Make her amends she weeps
OTHELLO                      O devil devil
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile
Out of my sight
LODOVICO Truly an obedient lady
I do beseech your lordship call her back
OTHELLO Mistress
DESDEMONA My lord
OTHELLO What would you with her sir
LODOVICO                              Who I my lord
OTHELLO Ay you did wish that I would make her turn
Sir she can turn and turn and yet go on
And turn again and she can weep sir weep
Very obedient Proceed you in your tears
I am commanded home Get you away
And will return to Venice Hence avaunt
Exit Desdemona
Cassio shall have my place And sir tonight
I do entreat that we may sup together
You are welcome sir to Cyprus Goats and monkeys
Exit
LODOVICO Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate
Call all in all sufficient This the nature
Whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue
The shot of accident nor dart of chance
Could neither graze nor pierce
IAGO                             He is much changed
LODOVICO Are his wits safe Is he not light of brain
What he might be if what he might he is not
I would to heaven he were
LODOVICO                    What strike his wife
IAGO Faith that was not so well yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst
LODOVICO                            Is it his use
Or did the letters work upon his blood
And new create this fault
IAGO                        Alas alas
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known You shall observe him
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech Do but go after
And mark how he continues
LODOVICO I am sorry that I am deceived in him             Exeunt
SCENE II
A room in the castle
Enter Othello and Emilia
OTHELLO You have seen nothing then
EMILIA Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect
OTHELLO Yes you have seen Cassio and she together
EMILIA But then I saw no harm and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them
OTHELLO What did they never whisper
EMILIA                                Never my lord
EMILIA Never
OTHELLO To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing
EMILIA Never my lord
EMILIA I durst my lord to wager she is honest
Lay down my soul at stake If you think other
Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom
If any wretch have put this in your head
For if she be not honest chaste and true
Is foul as slander
OTHELLO              Bid her come hither go         Exit Emilia
That cannot say as much This is a subtle whore
A closet lock and key of villainous secrets
Enter Desdemona with Emilia
DESDEMONA My lord what is your will
OTHELLO                               Pray chuck come hither
DESDEMONA What is your pleasure
OTHELLO                          Let me see your eyes
Look in my face
Leave procreants alone and shut the door
Your mystery your mystery nay dispatch           Exit Emilia
DESDEMONA Upon my knees what doth your speech import
I understand a fury in your words
But not the words
OTHELLO Why what art thou
DESDEMONA Your wife my lord your true and loyal wife
OTHELLO Come swear it damn thyself
Lest being like one of heaven the devils themselves
Swear thou art honest
DESDEMONA               Heaven doth truly know it
OTHELLO Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell
DESDEMONA To whom my lord with whom how am I false
OTHELLO O Desdemona Away away away
DESDEMONA Alas the heavy day Why do you weep
Am I the motive of these tears my lord
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back
Lay not your blame on me If you have lost him
Why I have lost him too
OTHELLO                    Had it pleased heaven
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience but alas to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at
Yet could I bear that too well very well
Where either I must live or bear no life
The fountain from the which my current runs
Or else dries up to be discarded thence
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there
Ay there look grim as hell
DESDEMONA I hope my noble lord esteems me honest
OTHELLO O ay as summer flies are in the shambles
That quicken even with blowing O thou weed
DESDEMONA Alas what ignorant sin have I committed
OTHELLO Was this fair paper this most goodly book
Committed O thou public commoner
I should make very forges of my cheeks
That would to cinders burn up modesty
Did I but speak thy deeds What committed
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
And will not hear it What committed
Impudent strumpet
DESDEMONA           By heaven you do me wrong
OTHELLO Are not you a strumpet
DESDEMONA                       No as I am a Christian
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet I am none
OTHELLO What not a whore
DESDEMONA                  No as I shall be saved
DESDEMONA O heaven forgive us
OTHELLO                         I cry you mercy then
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter
And keep the gate of hell
You you ay you
I pray you turn the key and keep our counsel             Exit
EMILIA Alas what does this gentleman conceive
How do you madam How do you my good lady
DESDEMONA Faith half asleep
DESDEMONA With who
EMILIA Why with my lord madam
DESDEMONA Who is thy lord
EMILIA                     He that is yours sweet lady
DESDEMONA I have none Do not talk to me Emilia
I cannot weep nor answer have I none
But what should go by water Prithee tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets Remember
And call thy husband hither
Exit
How have I been behaved that he might stick
DESDEMONA I cannot tell Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks
He might have chid me so for in good faith
I am a child to chiding
EMILIA Alas Iago my lord hath so bewhored her
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her
As true hearts cannot bear
DESDEMONA Am I that name Iago
IAGO                            What name fair lady
DESDEMONA Such as she says my lord did say I was
Could not have laid such terms upon his callet
IAGO Why did he so
DESDEMONA I do not know I am sure I am none such
IAGO Do not weep do not weep Alas the day
EMILIA Hath she forsook so many noble matches
Her father and her country and her friends
DESDEMONA It is my wretched fortune
How comes this trick upon him
DESDEMONA                       Nay heaven doth know
Some busy and insinuating rogue
Some cogging cozening slave to get some office
IAGO Fie there is no such man it is impossible
DESDEMONA If any such there be heaven pardon him
EMILIA A halter pardon him And hell gnaw his bones
Why should he call her whore Who keeps her company
What place What time What form What likelihood
Some base notorious knave some scurvy fellow
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west
IAGO                             Speak within door
EMILIA O fie upon them Some such squire he was
And made you to suspect me with the Moor
IAGO You are a fool go to
DESDEMONA                   O good Iago
What shall I do to win my lord again
Good friend go to him for by this light of heaven
I know not how I lost him Here I kneel
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed
Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense
Delighted them in any other form
Or that I do not yet and ever did
And ever will though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement love him dearly
Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much
And his unkindness may defeat my life
It doth abhor me now I speak the word
To do the act that might the addition earn
The business of the state does him offense
And he does chide with you
Hark how these instruments summon to supper
The messengers of Venice stay the meat
Go in and weep not all things shall be well
Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia
Enter Roderigo
How now Roderigo
RODERIGO I do not find that thou dealest justly with me
IAGO What in the contrary
RODERIGO Every day thou daffest me with some device Iago and
rather as it seems to me now keepest from me all conveniency
than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope I will indeed
no longer endure it nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace
what already I have foolishly suffered
IAGO Will you hear me Roderigo
RODERIGO Faith I have heard too much for your words and
performances are no kin together
IAGO You charge me most unjustly
RODERIGO With nought but truth I have wasted myself out of my
means The jewels you have had from me to deliver to Desdemona
would half have corrupted a votarist You have told me she hath
received them and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance but I find none
IAGO Well go to very well
myself fopped in it
IAGO Very well
to Desdemona If she will return me my jewels I will give over
my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation if not assure
yourself I will seek satisfaction of you
IAGO You have said now
RODERIGO Ay and said nothing but what I protest intendment of
doing
instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before Give
me thy hand Roderigo Thou hast taken against me a most just
exception but yet I protest have dealt most directly in thy
affair
RODERIGO It hath not appeared
IAGO I grant indeed it hath not appeared and your suspicion is
not without wit and judgement But Roderigo if thou hast that
in thee indeed which I have greater reason to believe now than
ever I mean purpose courage and valor this night show it if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona take me from
this world with treachery and devise engines for my life
RODERIGO Well what is it Is it within reason and compass
IAGO Sir there is especial commission come from Venice to depute
RODERIGO Is that true Why then Othello and Desdemona return again
to Venice
IAGO O no he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the
fair Desdemona unless his abode be lingered here by some
accident wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of
Cassio
RODERIGO How do you mean removing of him
his brains
RODERIGO And that you would have me to do
IAGO Ay if you dare do yourself a profit and a right He sups
tonight with a harlotry and thither will I go to him He knows
not yet of his honorable fortune If you will watch his going
thence which his will fashion to fall out between twelve and
one you may take him at your pleasure I will be near to second
your attempt and he shall fall between us Come stand not
amazed at it but go along with me I will show you such a
necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put
waste About it
RODERIGO I will hear further reason for this
IAGO And you shall be satisfied                           Exeunt
SCENE III
Another room in the castle
Enter Othello Lodovico Desdemona Emilia and Attendants
LODOVICO I do beseech you sir trouble yourself no further
LODOVICO Madam good night I humbly thank your ladyship
DESDEMONA Your honor is most welcome
OTHELLO                               Will you walk sir
DESDEMONA My lord
OTHELLO Get you to bed on the instant I will be returned
forthwith Dismiss your attendant there look it be done
DESDEMONA I will my lord
Exeunt Othello Lodovico and Attendants
EMILIA How goes it now He looks gentler than he did
DESDEMONA He says he will return incontinent
He hath commanded me to go to bed
And bade me to dismiss you
EMILIA                       Dismiss me
DESDEMONA It was his bidding therefore good Emilia
Give me my nightly wearing and adieu
We must not now displease him
EMILIA I would you had never seen him
DESDEMONA So would not I My love doth so approve him
EMILIA I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed
If I do die before thee prithee shroud me
In one of those same sheets
EMILIA                        Come come you talk
She was in love and he she loved proved mad
And she died singing it That song tonight
Will not go from my mind I have much to do
But to go hang my head all at one side
And sing it like poor Barbary Prithee dispatch
EMILIA Shall I go fetch your nightgown
DESDEMONA                               No unpin me here
This Lodovico is a proper man
EMILIA A very handsome man
DESDEMONA He speaks well
EMILIA I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot to
Palestine for a touch of his nether lip
Sing all a green willow
Her hand on her bosom her head on her knee
Sing willow willow willow
Sing willow willow willow
Sing willow willow willow
So get thee gone good night Mine eyes do itch
Doth that bode weeping
DESDEMONA I have heard it said so O these men these men
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind
EMILIA               There be some such no question
DESDEMONA Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
EMILIA Why would not you
DESDEMONA                  No by this heavenly light
DESDEMONA Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world
For a small vice
DESDEMONA          In troth I think thou wouldst not
measures of lawn nor for gowns petticoats nor caps nor any
make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch I should
DESDEMONA Beshrew me if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world
might quickly make it right
DESDEMONA I do not think there is any such woman
EMILIA Yes a dozen and as many to the vantage as would store the
world they played for
If wives do fall say that they slack their duties
And pour our treasures into foreign laps
Or else break out in peevish jealousies
Throwing restraint upon us or say they strike us
Or scant our former having in despite
Why we have galls and though we have some grace
Yet have we some revenge Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour
As husbands have What is it that they do
When they change us for others Is it sport
I think it is And doth affection breed it
It is so too And have not we affections
Desires for sport and frailty as men have
Then let them use us well else let them know
The ills we do their ills instruct us so
DESDEMONA Good night good night Heaven me such uses send
Not to pick bad from bad but by bad mend                Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Cyprus A street
Enter Iago and Roderigo
IAGO Here stand behind this bulk straight will he come
Wear thy good rapier bare and put it home
It makes us or it mars us think on that
And fix most firm thy resolution
IAGO Here at thy hand be bold and take thy stand
Retires
RODERIGO I have no great devotion to the deed
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons
And he grows angry Now whether he kill Cassio
Or Cassio him or each do kill the other
Every way makes my gain Live Roderigo
He calls me to a restitution large
As gifts to Desdemona
It must not be If Cassio do remain
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly and besides the Moor
May unfold me to him there stand I in much peril
Enter Cassio
Makes a pass at Cassio
CASSIO That thrust had been mine enemy indeed
I will make proof of thine           Draws and wounds Roderigo

BIANCA O my dear Cassio my sweet Cassio O Cassio Cassio

CASSIO No
GRATIANO I am sorry to find you thus I have been to seek you
IAGO Lend me a garter So O for a chair
To bear him easily hence
BIANCA Alas he faints O Cassio Cassio Cassio

Was my dear friend what malice was between you
CASSIO None in the world nor do I know the man
Cassio and Roderigo are borne off
Stay you good gentlemen Look you pale mistress
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye
Nay if you stare we shall hear more anon
Behold her well I pray you look upon her
Do you see gentlemen Nay guiltiness will speak
Though tongues were out of use
Enter Emilia
IAGO Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
EMILIA Alas good gentleman alas good Cassio
IAGO This is the fruit of whoring Prithee Emilia

SCENE II
A bedchamber in the castle Desdemona in bed asleep a light burning
Enter Othello
OTHELLO It is the cause it is the cause my soul
Let me not name it to you you chaste stars
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow
And smooth as monumental alabaster
Put out the light and then put out the light
If I quench thee thou flaming minister
I can again thy former light restore
Should I repent me but once put out thy light
I know not where is that Promethean heat
I cannot give it vital growth again
O balmy breath that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword One more one more
Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee
And love thee after One more and this the last
It strikes where it doth love She wakes
OTHELLO                         Ay Desdemona
DESDEMONA Will you come to bed my lord
DESDEMONA Ay my lord
OTHELLO If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace
Solicit for it straight
DESDEMONA Alas my lord what may you mean by that
OTHELLO Well do it and be brief I will walk by
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit
No heaven forfend I would not kill thy soul
DESDEMONA Talk you of killing
OTHELLO Ay I do
DESDEMONA Then heaven have mercy on me
OTHELLO Amen with all my heart
DESDEMONA If you say so I hope you will not kill me
OTHELLO Hum
DESDEMONA And yet I fear you for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so Why I should fear I know not
Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear
OTHELLO Think on thy sins
DESDEMONA                  They are loves I bear to you
OTHELLO Ay and for that thou diest
Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame
These are portents but yet I hope I hope
They do not point on me
OTHELLO                   Peace and be still
OTHELLO That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio
DESDEMONA               No by my life and soul
Send for the man and ask him
OTHELLO                         Sweet soul take heed
Take heed of perjury thou are on thy deathbed
DESDEMONA Ay but not yet to die
OTHELLO                           Yes presently
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal Thou art to die
DESDEMONA Then Lord have mercy on me
OTHELLO                               I say amen
DESDEMONA And have you mercy too I never did
Offend you in my life never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love I never gave him token
O perjured woman Thou dost stone my heart
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murther which I thought a sacrifice
I saw the handkerchief
DESDEMONA                He found it then
I never gave it him Send for him hither
Let him confess a truth
DESDEMONA What my lord
OTHELLO That he hath used thee
DESDEMONA                       How unlawfully
OTHELLO Ay
DESDEMONA He will not say so
DESDEMONA O my fear interprets What is he dead
OTHELLO Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge
Had stomach for them all
DESDEMONA O banish me my lord but kill me not
OTHELLO Down strumpet
DESDEMONA Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight
DESDEMONA But half an hour
OTHELLO                     Being done there is no pause
DESDEMONA But while I say one prayer
OTHELLO                        It is too late     He stifles her
OTHELLO What noise is this Not dead not yet quite dead
I that am cruel am yet merciful
I would not have thee linger in thy pain
So so
The noise was here Ha no more moving
My wife My wife What wife I have no wife
O insupportable O heavy hour
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration
That I may speak with you O good my lord
OTHELLO I had forgot thee O come in Emilia
Soft by and by Let me the curtains draw
Where art thou                                 Unlocks the door
Enter Emilia
OTHELLO What now
EMILIA But now my lord
OTHELLO It is the very error of the moon
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont
And makes men mad
And sweet revenge grows harsh
EMILIA                                   Alas what cry is that
OTHELLO That what
Help help ho help O lady speak again
Sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress speak
DESDEMONA A guiltless death I die
EMILIA O who hath done this deed
DESDEMONA Nobody I myself Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord O farewell                    Dies
EMILIA                                    Alas who knows
OTHELLO You heard her say herself it was not I
EMILIA She said so I must needs report the truth
EMILIA                    O the more angel she
And you the blacker devil
EMILIA Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil
OTHELLO She was false as water
EMILIA                          Thou art rash as fire to say
That she was false O she was heavenly true
OTHELLO Cassio did top her ask thy husband else
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity Thy husband knew it all
EMILIA My husband
OTHELLO Thy husband
EMILIA That she was false to wedlock
OTHELLO Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite
EMILIA                          My husband
An honest man he is and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds
EMILIA                        My husband
OTHELLO What needs this iteration woman I say thy husband
EMILIA O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love
My husband say that she was false
OTHELLO                             He woman
I say thy husband Dost understand the word
My friend thy husband honest honest Iago
EMILIA If he say so may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day He lies to the heart
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain
OTHELLO Ha
EMILIA Do thy worst
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her
OTHELLO                     Peace you were best
EMILIA Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt O gull O dolt
Though I lost twenty lives Help help ho help
Enter Montano Gratiano Iago and others
MONTANO What is the matter How now general
EMILIA O are you come Iago You have done well
That men must lay their murthers on your neck
GRATIANO What is the matter
Speak for my heart is full
IAGO I told him what I thought and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true
EMILIA But did you ever tell him she was false
IAGO I did
EMILIA You told a lie an odious damned lie
Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie
She false with Cassio Did you say with Cassio
IAGO With Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue
EMILIA I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak
ALL O heavens forfend
EMILIA And your reports have set the murther on
OTHELLO Nay stare not masters it is true indeed
MONTANO O monstrous act
EMILIA                   Villainy villainy villainy
O villainy villainy
IAGO What are you mad I charge you get you home
EMILIA Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak
OTHELLO O O O                                 Falls on the bed
EMILIA           Nay lay thee down and roar
I scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece
I know this act shows horrible and grim
Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief
Shore his old thread in twain did he live now
This sight would make him do a desperate turn
Yea curse his better angel from his side
And fall to reprobation
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her I saw it in his hand
It was a handkerchief an antique token
My father gave my mother
EMILIA O heaven O heavenly powers
No I will speak as liberal as the north
Let heaven and men and devils let them all
IAGO Be wise and get you home
EMILIA                          I will not
Iago offers to stab Emilia
GRATIANO                                    Fie
Your sword upon a woman
I found by fortune and did give my husband
For often with a solemn earnestness
IAGO                          Villainous whore
EMILIA She give it Cassio No alas I found it
IAGO                          Filth thou liest
EMILIA By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen
O murtherous coxcomb What should such a fool
Do with so good a wife
OTHELLO                  Are there not stones in heaven
But what serve for thunder Precious villain
He runs at Iago but Montano
disarms him Iago stabs Emilia
Come guard the door without let him not pass
OTHELLO                   I am not valiant neither
But every puny whipster gets my sword
But why should honor outlive honesty
Let it go all
EMILIA          What did thy song bode lady
Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan
Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor
So come my soul to bliss as I speak true
So speaking as I think I die I die                       Dies
OTHELLO I have another weapon in this chamber
O here it is Uncle I must come forth
Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer
OTHELLO Look in upon me then and speak with me
Or naked as I am I will assault thee
GRATIANO What is the matter
OTHELLO                      Behold I have a weapon
A better never did itself sustain
That with this little arm and this good sword
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop But O vain boast
And he retires Where should Othello go
Pale as thy smock When we shall meet at compt
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven
And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl
Even like thy chastity O cursed cursed slave
Whip me ye devils
From the possession of this heavenly sight
Blow me about in winds Roast me in sulphur
O Desdemon dead Desdemon dead
O O O
Enter Lodovico Montano Cassio carried in a chair
and Officers with Iago prisoner
LODOVICO Where is this rash and most unfortunate man
LODOVICO Where is that viper Bring the villain forth
LODOVICO Wrench his sword from him
LODOVICO O thou Othello that wert once so good
What shall be said to thee
OTHELLO                      Why anything
An honorable murtherer if you will
For nought did I in hate but all in honor
OTHELLO Ay
CASSIO Dear general I never gave you cause
OTHELLO I do believe it and I ask your pardon
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body
IAGO Demand me nothing what you know you know
From this time forth I never will speak word
LODOVICO What not to pray
GRATIANO                    Torments will ope your lips
OTHELLO Well thou dost best
Which as I think you know not Here is a letter
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo
And here another The one of them imports
The death of Cassio to be undertook
By Roderigo
OTHELLO O villain
CASSIO             Most heathenish and most gross
Found in his pocket too and this it seems
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain
But that belike Iago in the interim
Came in and satisfied him
OTHELLO                     O the pernicious caitiff
How came you Cassio by that handkerchief
CASSIO               I found it in my chamber
Which wrought to his desire
OTHELLO                       O fool fool fool
How he upbraids Iago that he made him
Brave me upon the watch whereon it came
That I was cast And even but now he spake
After long seeming dead Iago hurt him
Iago set him on
LODOVICO You must forsake this room and go with us
Your power and your command is taken off
And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave
If there be any cunning cruelty
That can torment him much and hold him long
It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest
Till that the nature of your fault be known
To the Venetian state Come bring away
OTHELLO Soft you a word or two before you go
No more of that I pray you in your letters
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate
Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate
Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well
Of one not easily jealous but being wrought
Like the base Indian threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes
Albeit unused to the melting mood
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum Set you down this
And say besides that in Aleppo once
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state
I took by the throat the circumcised dog
And smote him thus                               Stabs himself
LODOVICO O bloody period
Killing myself to die upon a kiss
Falls on the bed and dies
CASSIO This did I fear but thought he had no weapon
For he was great of heart
More fell than anguish hunger or the sea
Look on the tragic loading of this bed
This is thy work The object poisons sight
Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor
For they succeed on you To you Lord Governor
Remains the censure of this hellish villain
The time the place the torture O enforce it
Myself will straight aboard and to the state
This heavy act with heavy heart relate                   Exeunt

SCENE
England and Wales
ACT I SCENE I
London The palace
Enter RICHARD JOHN OF GAUNT with other NOBLES and attendants
Hast thou according to thy oath and band
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son
Which then our leisure would not let us hear
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
GAUNT I have my liege
KING RICHARD Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice
Or worthily as a good subject should
On some known ground of treachery in him
GAUNT As near as I could sift him on that argument
On some apparent danger seen in him
KING RICHARD Then call them to our presence face to face
And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
The accuser and the accused freely speak
In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
Enter BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY
BOLINGBROKE Many years of happy days befall
My gracious sovereign my most loving liege
Add an immortal title to your crown
KING RICHARD We thank you both yet one but flatters us
As well appeareth by the cause you come
Namely to appeal each other of high treason
Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object
Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
And free from other misbegotten hate
Come I appellant to this princely presence
Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee
And mark my greeting well for what I speak
My body shall make good upon this earth
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant
Too good to be so and too bad to live
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
Once more the more to aggravate the note
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
MOWBRAY Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
First the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech
These terms of treason doubled down his throat
And let him be no kinsman to my liege
I do defy him and I spit at him
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain
Which to maintain I would allow him odds
And meet him were I tied to run afoot
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps
Or any other ground inhabitable
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot
By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
BOLINGBROKE Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage
Disclaiming here the kindred of the King
Which fear not reverence makes thee to except
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
By that and all the rites of knighthood else
Will I make good against thee arm to arm
What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise
MOWBRAY I take it up and by that sword I swear
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial
And when I mount alive may I not light
If I be traitor or unjustly fight
It must be great that can inherit us
So much as of a thought of ill in him
Like a false traitor and injurious villain
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
That all the treasons for these eighteen years
Complotted and contrived in this land
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring
Further I say and further will maintain
Upon his bad life to make all this good
And consequently like a traitor coward
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
To me for justice and rough chastisement
And by the glorious worth of my descent
This arm shall do it or this life be spent
KING RICHARD How high a pitch his resolution soars
MOWBRAY O let my sovereign turn away his face
And bid his ears a little while be deaf
Till I have told this slander of his blood
How God and good men hate so foul a liar
KING RICHARD Mowbray impartial are our eyes and cars
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul
He is our subject Mowbray so art thou
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow
MOWBRAY Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
Upon remainder of a dear account
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen
I slew him not but to my own disgrace
Neglected my sworn duty in that case
For you my noble Lord of Lancaster
The honourable father to my foe
Once did I lay an ambush for your life
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
It issues from the rancour of a villain
A recreant and most degenerate traitor
Which in myself I boldly will defend
And interchangeably hurl down my gage
To prove myself a loyal gentleman
In haste whereof most heartily I pray
Your Highness to assign our trial day
This we prescribe though no physician
Deep malice makes too deep incision
Forget forgive conclude and be agreed
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed
Good uncle let this end where it begun
KING RICHARD And Norfolk throw down his
GAUNT When Harry when
Obedience bids I should not bid again
KING RICHARD Norfolk throw down we bid
There is no boot
MOWBRAY Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot
My life thou shalt command but not my shame
The one my duty owes but my fair name
Despite of death that lives upon my grave
KING RICHARD Rage must be withstood
MOWBRAY Yea but not change his spots Take but my shame
And I resign my gage My dear dear lord
The purest treasure mortal times afford
Is spotless reputation that away
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
Mine honour is my life both grow in one
Take honour from me and my life is done
Then dear my liege mine honour let me try
In that I live and for that will I die
KING RICHARD Cousin throw up your gage do you begin
BOLINGBROKE O God defend my soul from such deep sin
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
The slavish motive of recanting fear
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
Exit GAUNT
KING RICHARD We were not born to sue but to command
Which since we cannot do to make you friends
Be ready as your lives shall answer it
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
The swelling difference of your settled hate
Since we can not atone you we shall see
Be ready to direct these home alarms                 Exeunt
SCENE 2
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
To stir against the butchers of his life
But since correction lieth in those hands
Which made the fault that we cannot correct
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
Who when they see the hours ripe on earth
DUCHESS Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood
Or seven fair branches springing from one root
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut
But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester
One flourishing branch of his most royal root
Ah Gaunt his blood was thine That bed that womb
Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
Yet art thou slain in him Thou dost consent
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee
That which in mean men we entitle patience
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
What shall I say To safeguard thine own life
His deputy anointed in His sight
Let heaven revenge for I may never lift
An angry arm against His minister
DUCHESS Where then alas may I complain myself
DUCHESS Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt
Thou goest to Coventry there to behold
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight
Or if misfortune miss the first career
And throw the rider headlong in the lists
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford
With her companion Grief must end her life
GAUNT Sister farewell I must to Coventry
As much good stay with thee as go with me
Not with the empty hollowness but weight
I take my leave before I have begun
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
Commend me to thy brother Edmund York
Though this be all do not so quickly go
With all good speed at Plashy visit me
Alack and what shall good old York there see
Unpeopled offices untrodden stones
And what hear there for welcome but my groans
Therefore commend me let him not come there
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where
Desolate desolate will I hence and die
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye          Exeunt
SCENE 3
The lists at Coventry
Enter the LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE
AUMERLE Yea at all points and longs to enter in
MARSHAL The Duke of Norfolk spightfully and bold
The trumpets sound and the KING enters with his nobles
GAUNT BUSHY BAGOT GREEN and others When they are set
enter MOWBRAY Duke of Nor folk in arms defendant and
a HERALD
KING RICHARD Marshal demand of yonder champion
The cause of his arrival here in arms
Ask him his name and orderly proceed
To swear him in the justice of his cause
And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath
As so defend thee heaven and thy valour
MOWBRAY My name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
Both to defend my loyalty and truth
To God my King and my succeeding issue
Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
And by the grace of God and this mine arm
To prove him in defending of myself
A traitor to my God my King and me
And as I truly fight defend me heaven
The trumpets sound Enter BOLINGBROKE Duke of Hereford
appellant in armour and a HERALD
KING RICHARD Marshal ask yonder knight in arms
Both who he is and why he cometh hither
Thus plated in habiliments of war
And formally according to our law
Depose him in the justice of his cause
Before King Richard in his royal lists
Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven
BOLINGBROKE Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Am I who ready here do stand in arms
In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
That he is a traitor foul and dangerous
To God of heaven King Richard and to me
And as I truly fight defend me heaven
MARSHAL On pain of death no person be so bold
Except the Marshal and such officers
Appointed to direct these fair designs
And bow my knee before his Majesty
For Mowbray and myself are like two men
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage
Then let us take a ceremonious leave
And loving farewell of our several friends
MARSHAL The appellant in all duty greets your Highness
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave
KING RICHARD We will descend and fold him in our arms
Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right
So be thy fortune in this royal fight
Lament we may but not revenge thee dead
BOLINGBROKE O let no noble eye profane a tear
Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight
My loving lord I take my leave of you
Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle
Not sick although I have to do with death
But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
Lo as at English feasts so I regreet
The daintiest last to make the end most sweet
O thou the earthly author of my blood
Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
To reach at victory above my head
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
Even in the lusty haviour of his son
GAUNT God in thy good cause make thee prosperous
Be swift like lightning in the execution
And let thy blows doubly redoubled
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy
Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
BOLINGBROKE Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive
MOWBRAY However God or fortune cast my lot
A loyal just and upright gentleman
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary
Most mighty liege and my companion peers
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years
As gentle and as jocund as to jest
Go I to fight truth hath a quiet breast
KING RICHARD Farewell my lord securely I espy
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye
Order the trial Marshal and begin
MARSHAL Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Receive thy lance and God defend the right
BOLINGBROKE Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen
Duke of Norfolk
FIRST HERALD Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
Stands here for God his sovereign and himself
On pain to be found false and recreant
To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray
A traitor to his God his King and him
And dares him to set forward to the fight
SECOND HERALD Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk
On pain to be found false and recreant
Both to defend himself and to approve
Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby
To God his sovereign and to him disloyal
Courageously and with a free desire
Attending but the signal to begin
MARSHAL Sound trumpets and set forward combatants
Stay the King hath thrown his warder down
KING RICHARD Let them lay by their helmets and their spears
And both return back to their chairs again
Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound
While we return these dukes what we decree
A long flourish while the KING consults his Council
Draw near
And list what with our council we have done
With that dear blood which it hath fostered
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
Therefore we banish you our territories
You cousin Hereford upon pain of life
Shall not regreet our fair dominions
But tread the stranger paths of banishment
That sun that warms you here shall shine on me
And those his golden beams to you here lent
Shall point on me and gild my banishment
KING RICHARD Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce
The sly slow hours shall not determinate
The dateless limit of thy dear exile
Breathe I against thee upon pain of life
MOWBRAY A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
A dearer merit not so deep a maim
As to be cast forth in the common air
The language I have learnt these forty years
My native English now I must forgo
Than an unstringed viol or a harp
Or being open put into his hands
That knows no touch to tune the harmony
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
Is made my gaoler to attend on me
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse
Too far in years to be a pupil now
What is thy sentence then but speechless death
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
KING RICHARD It boots thee not to be compassionate
After our sentence plaining comes too late
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night
KING RICHARD Return again and take an oath with thee
Swear by the duty that you owe to God
Our part therein we banish with yourselves
To keep the oath that we administer
You never shall so help you truth and God
Nor never write regreet nor reconcile
Nor never by advised purpose meet
To plot contrive or complot any ill
BOLINGBROKE I swear
MOWBRAY And I to keep all this
BOLINGBROKE Norfolk so far as to mine enemy
By this time had the King permitted us
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
Since thou hast far to go bear not along
The clogging burden of a guilty soul
MOWBRAY No Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor
My name be blotted from the book of life
But what thou art God thou and I do know
And all too soon I fear the King shall rue
Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray
KING RICHARD Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
I see thy grieved heart Thy sad aspect
Return with welcome home from banishment
BOLINGBROKE How long a time lies in one little word
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
End in a word such is the breath of Kings
GAUNT I thank my liege that in regard of me
But little vantage shall I reap thereby
For ere the six years that he hath to spend
Can change their moons and bring their times about
Shall be extinct with age and endless night
My inch of taper will be burnt and done
And blindfold death not let me see my son
KING RICHARD Why uncle thou hast many years to live
GAUNT But not a minute King that thou canst give
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
Thy word is current with him for my death
But dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
GAUNT Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
You would have bid me argue like a father
O had it been a stranger not my child
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild
A partial slander sought I to avoid
I was too strict to make mine own away
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
Against my will to do myself this wrong
KING RICHARD Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so
Six years we banish him and he shall go
Flourish Exit KING with train
AUMERLE Cousin farewell what presence must not know
From where you do remain let paper show
MARSHAL My lord no leave take I for I will ride
As far as land will let me by your side
GAUNT O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends
BOLINGBROKE I have too few to take my leave of you
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
GAUNT Thy grief is but thy absence for a time
BOLINGBROKE Joy absent grief is present for that time
GAUNT What is six winters They are quickly gone
BOLINGBROKE To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
BOLINGBROKE My heart will sigh when I miscall it so
Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage
GAUNT The sullen passage of thy weary steps
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
The precious jewel of thy home return
BOLINGBROKE Nay rather every tedious stride I make
Will but remember me what a deal of world
I wander from the jewels that I love
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
To foreign passages and in the end
Having my freedom boast of nothing else
But that I was a journeyman to grief
GAUNT All places that the eye of heaven visits
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens
Teach thy necessity to reason thus
There is no virtue like necessity
Think not the King did banish thee
But thou the King Woe doth the heavier sit
Where it perceives it is but faintly home
Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
And thou art flying to a fresher clime
Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
Suppose the singing birds musicians
The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
Than a delightful measure or a dance
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
The man that mocks at it and sets it light
BOLINGBROKE O who can hold a fire in his hand
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
By bare imagination of a feast
Or wallow naked in December snow
O no the apprehension of the good
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse
Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
Had I thy youtli and cause I would not stay
My mother and my nurse that bears me yet
SCENE 4
London The court
Enter the KING with BAGOT and GREEN at one door
and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another
KING RICHARD We did observe Cousin Aumerle
How far brought you high Hereford on his way
AUMERLE I brought high Hereford if you call him so
But to the next high way and there I left him
KING RICHARD And say what store of parting tears were shed
Which then blew bitterly against our faces
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear
KING RICHARD What said our cousin when you parted with him
And for my heart disdained that my tongue
Should so profane the word that taught me craft
To counterfeit oppression of such grief
And added years to his short banishment
He should have had a volume of farewells
But since it would not he had none of me
When time shall call him home from banishment
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends
Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green
How he did seem to dive into their hearts
With humble and familiar courtesy
What reverence he did throw away on slaves
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
And patient underbearing of his fortune
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
And had the tribute of his supple knee
As were our England in reversion his
GREEN Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland
Expedient manage must be made my liege
Ere further leisure yicld them further means
KING RICHARD We will ourself in person to this war
And for our coffers with too great a court
And liberal largess are grown somewhat light
The revenue whereof shall furnish us
For our affairs in hand If that come short
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
Whereto when they shall know what men are rich
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
And send them after to supply our wants
For we will make for Ireland presently
Enter BUSHY
Bushy what news
BUSHY Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord
To entreat your Majesty to visit him
KING RICHARD Where lies he
BUSHY At Ely House
To help him to his grave immediately
The lining of his coffers shall make coats
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars
Pray God we may make haste and come too late
ALL Amen                                              Exeunt

ACT II SCENE I
London Ely House
Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick with the DUKE OF YORK etc
GAUNT Will the King come that I may breathe my last
In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
YORK Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
For all in vain comes counsel to his ear
GAUNT O but they say the tongues of dying men
Enforce attention like deep harmony
Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
The setting sun and music at the close
As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
Writ in remembrance more than things long past
As praises of whose taste the wise are fond
Lascivious metres to whose venom sound
The open ear of youth doth always listen
Report of fashions in proud Italy
Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
Limps after in base imitation
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard
Direct not him whose way himself will choose
And thus expiring do foretell of him
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
For violent fires soon burn out themselves
Small showers last long but sudden storms are short
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder
Light vanity insatiate cormorant
Consuming means soon preys upon itself
This earth of majesty this seat of Mars
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war
This happy breed of men this little world
This precious stone set in the silver sea
Which serves it in the office of a wall
Or as a moat defensive to a house
Against the envy of less happier lands
This blessed plot this earth this realm this England
This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
Renowned for their deeds as far from home
For Christian service and true chivalry
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
This land of such dear souls this dear dear land
Dear for her reputation through the world
Like to a tenement or pelting farm
England bound in with the triumphant sea
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds
That England that was wont to conquer others
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself
Ah would the scandal vanish with my life
How happy then were my ensuing death
Enter KING and QUEEN AUMERLE BUSHY GREEN BAGOT
Ross and WILLOUGHBY
YORK The King is come deal mildly with his youth
QUEEN How fares our noble uncle Lancaster
GAUNT O how that name befits my composition
Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
Watching breeds leanness leanness is an gaunt
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt
Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
KING RICHARD Can sick men play so nicely with their names
GAUNT No misery makes sport to mock itself
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
I mock my name great king to flatter thee
KING RICHARD Should dying men flatter with those that live
GAUNT No no men living flatter those that die
GAUNT O no thou diest though I the sicker be
KING RICHARD I am in health I breathe and see thee ill
GAUNT Now He that made me knows I see thee ill
Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick
And thou too careless patient as thou art
Of those physicians that first wounded thee
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head
And yet incaged in so small a verge
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
Why cousin wert thou regent of the world
It were a shame to let this land by lease
But for thy world enjoying but this land
Is it not more than shame to shame it so
Landlord of England art thou now not King
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law
Darest with thy frozen admonition
Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
With fury from his native residence
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
That blood already like the pelican
May be a precedent and witness good
Join with the present sickness that I have
And thy unkindness be like crooked age
To crop at once a too long withered flower
Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
These words hereafter thy tormentors be
Convey me to my bed then to my grave
Love they to live that love and honour have
Exit borne out by his attendants
KING RICHARD And let them die that age and sullens have
For both hast thou and both become the grave
YORK I do beseech your Majesty impute his words
To wayward sickliness and age in him
He loves you on my life and holds you dear
As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here
As theirs so mine and all be as it is
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
NORTHUMBERLAND My liege old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty
KING RICHARD What says he
NORTHUMBERLAND Nay nothing all is said
His tongue is now a stringless instrument
Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent
YORK Be York the next that must be bankrupt so
Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
KING RICHARD The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
His time is spent our pilgrimage must be
So much for that Now for our Irish wars
Which live like venom where no venom else
But only they have privilege to live
And for these great affairs do ask some charge
Towards our assistance we do seize to us
The plate coin revenues and moveables
YORK How long shall I be patient Ah how long
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
About his marriage nor my own disgrace
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek
Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild
Than was that young and princely gentleman
And not against his friends His noble hand
Did win what he did spend and spent not that
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood
But bloody with the enemies of his kin
O Richard York is too far gone with grief
YORK O my liege
Not to be pardoned am content withal
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live
Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true
Did not the one deserve to have an heir
His charters and his customary rights
But by fair sequence and succession
Call in the letters patents that he hath
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head
And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
Which honour and allegiance cannot think
KING RICHARD Think what you will we seize into our hands
His plate his goods his money and his lands
But by bad courses may be understood
That their events can never fall out good              Exit
KING RICHARD Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight
Bid him repair to us to Ely House
And we create in absence of ourself
Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England
Be merry for our time of stay is short
Flourish Exeunt KING QUEEN BUSHY AUMERLE
GREEN and BAGOT
NORTHUMBERLAND Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead
Ross And living too for now his son is Duke
WILLOUGHBY Barely in title not in revenues
NORTHUMBERLAND Richly in both if justice had her right
ROSS My heart is great but it must break with silence
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm
WILLOUGHBY Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford
If it be so out with it boldly man
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
ROSS No good at all that I can do for him
Unless you call it good to pity him
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony
In him a royal prince and many moe
Of noble blood in this declining land
The King is not himself but basely led
By flatterers and what they will inform
That will the King severely prosecute
And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he find
For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
As blanks benevolences and I wot not what
But basely yielded upon compromise
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars
ROSS The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm
NORTHUMBERLAND Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
ROSS He hath not money for these Irish wars
His burdenous taxations notwithstanding
But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails
And yet we strike not but securely perish
ROSS We see the very wreck that we must suffer
And unavoided is the danger now
For suffering so the causes of our wreck
NORTHUMBERLAND Not so even through the hollow eyes of death
I spy life peering but I dare not say
How near the tidings of our comfort is
WILLOUGHBY Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
ROSS Be confident to speak Northumberland
We three are but thyself and speaking so
Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
NORTHUMBERLAND Then thus I have from Le Port Blanc a bay
That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter
His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury
Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston
With eight tall ships three thousand men of war
Are making hither with all due expedience
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore
Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
The first departing of the King for Ireland
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
And make high majesty look like itself
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh
But if you faint as fearing to do so
Stay and be secret and myself will go
ROSS To horse to horse Urge doubts to them that fear
WILLOUGHBY Hold out my horse and I will first be there
Exeunt
SCENE 2
Windsor Castle
Enter QUEEN BUSHY and BAGOT
BUSHY Madam your Majesty is too much sad
And entertain a cheerful disposition
QUEEN To please the King I did to please myself
I cannot do it yet I know no cause
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks
Is coming towards me and my inward soul
With nothing trembles At some thing it grieves
More than with parting from my lord the King
BUSHY Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
Which shows like grief itself but is not so
Divides one thing entire to many objects
Distinguish form So your sweet Majesty
Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
Which for things true weeps things imaginary
QUEEN It may be so but yet my inward soul
I cannot but be sad so heavy sad
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
From some forefather grief mine is not so
For nothing hath begot my something grief
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve
But what it is that is not yet known what
Enter GREEN
GREEN God save your Majesty and well met gentlemen
For his designs crave haste his haste good hope
Who strongly hath set footing in this land
At Ravenspurgh
QUEEN Now God in heaven forbid
The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy
The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby
With all their powerful friends are fled to him
And all the rest revolted faction traitors
GREEN We have whereupon the Earl of Worcester
And all the household servants fled with him
To Bolingbroke
QUEEN So Green thou art the midwife to my woe
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
BUSHY Despair not madam
QUEEN Who shall hinder me
I will despair and be at enmity
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life
Which false hope lingers in extremity
Enter YORK
GREEN Here comes the Duke of York
QUEEN With signs of war about his aged neck
O full of careful business are his looks
YORK Should I do so I should belie my thoughts
Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
Your husband he is gone to save far off
Whilst others come to make him lose at home
Here am I left to underprop his land
Who weak with age cannot support myself
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
Enter a SERVINGMAN
SERVINGMAN My lord your son was gone before I came
The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound
Hold take my ring
SERVINGMAN My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship
But I shall grieve you to report the rest
SERVINGMAN An hour before I came the Duchess died
YORK God for his mercy what a tide of woes
Comes rushing on this woeful land at once
I know not what to do I would to God
How shall we do for money for these wars
Go fellow get thee home provide some carts
And bring away the armour that is there
Exit SERVINGMAN
Gentlemen will you go muster men
If I know how or which way to order these affairs
Thus disorderly thrust into my hands
Never believe me Both are my kinsmen
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
And meet me presently at Berkeley
I should to Plashy too
But time will not permit All is uneven
And everything is left at six and seven
Exeunt YORK and QUEEN
BUSHY The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland
But none returns For us to levy power
Proportionable to the enemy
Is all unpossible
GREEN Besides our nearness to the King in love
Is near the hate of those love not the King
BAGOT And that is the wavering commons for their love
Lies in their purses and whoso empties them
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
BAGOT If judgment lie in them then so do we
Because we ever have been near the King
GREEN Well I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there
BUSHY Thither will I with you for little office
Will the hateful commons perform for us
Except Eke curs to tear us all to pieces
Will you go along with us
BAGOT No I will to Ireland to his Majesty
GREEN Alas poor Duke the task he undertakes
Where one on his side fights thousands will fly
BUSHY Well we may meet again
BAGOT I fear me never                                Exeunt
SCENE 3
Gloucestershire
Enter BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND forces
BOLINGBROKE How far is it my lord to Berkeley now
NORTHUMBERLAND Believe me noble lord
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
Making the hard way sweet and delectable
But I bethink me what a weary way
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company
The tediousness and process of my travel
The present benefit which I possess
And hope to joy is little less in joy
Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
By sight of what I have your noble company
BOLINGBROKE Of much less value is my company
Than your good words But who comes here
Enter HARRY PERCY
NORTHUMBERLAND It is my son young Harry Percy
Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever
Harry how fares your uncle
NORTHUMBERLAND Why is he not with the Queen
PERCY No my good lord he hath forsook the court
The household of the King
NORTHUMBERLAND What was his reason
PERCY Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford
And sent me over by Berkeley to discover
What power the Duke of York had levied there
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh
NORTHUMBERLAND Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy
PERCY No my good lord for that is not forgot
I never in my life did look on him
NORTHUMBERLAND Then learn to know him now this is the Duke
PERCY My gracious lord I tender you my service
Such as it is being tender raw and young
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
To more approved service and desert
BOLINGBROKE I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure
I count myself in nothing else so happy
And as my fortune ripens with thy love
My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
NORTHUMBERLAND How far is it to Berkeley And what stir
Keeps good old York there with his men of war
PERCY There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
None else of name and noble estimate
Enter Ross and WILLOUGHBY
NORTHUMBERLAND Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby
BOLINGBROKE Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues
ROSS Your presence makes us rich most noble lord
WILLOUGHBY And far surmounts our labour to attain it
BOLINGBROKE Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
Which till my infant fortune comes to years
Stands for my bounty But who comes here
Enter BERKELEY
NORTHUMBERLAND It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess
BERKELEY My Lord of Hereford my message is to you
And I am come to seek that name in England
And I must find that title in your tongue
Before I make reply to aught you say
To raze one title of your honour out
From the most gracious regent of this land
The Duke of York to know what pricks you on
To take advantage of the absent time
Enter YORK attended
BOLINGBROKE I shall not need transport my words by you
Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncle
YORK Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
Whose duty is deceivable and false
YORK Tut tut
Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle
In an ungracious mouth is but profane
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom
And ostentation of despised arms
Why foolish boy the King is left behind
And in my loyal bosom lies his power
Were I but now lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself
Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men
From forth the ranks of many thousand French
O then how quickly should this arm of mine
Now prisoner to the palsy chastise the
And minister correction to thy fault
BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle let me know my fault
On what condition stands it and wherein
In gross rebellion and detested treason
Before the expiration of thy time
In braving arms against thy sovereign
But as I come I come for Lancaster
And noble uncle I beseech your Grace
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye
You are my father for methinks in you
I see old Gaunt alive O then my father
A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born
If that my cousin king be King in England
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster
You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin
Had you first died and he been thus trod down
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
I am denied to sue my livery here
And yet my letters patents give me leave
What would you have me do I am a subject
And therefore personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent
NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath been too much abused
ROSS It stands your Grace upon to do him right
WILLOUGHBY Base men by his endowments are made great
YORK My lords of England let me tell you this
But in this kind to come in braving arms
Be his own carver and cut out his way
And you that do abet him in this kind
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all
NORTHUMBERLAND The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
But for his own and for the right of that
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid
And let him never see joy that breaks that oath
YORK Well well I see the issue of these arms
I cannot mend it I must needs confess
Because my power is weak and all ill left
But if I could by Him that gave me life
I would attach you all and make you stoop
Unto the sovereign mercy of the King
But since I cannot be it known unto you
I do remain as neuter So fare you well
Unless you please to enter in the castle
And there repose you for this night
BOLINGBROKE An offer uncle that we will accept
But we must win your Grace to go with us
To Bristow Castle which they say is held
By Bushy Bagot and their complices
The caterpillars of the commonwealth
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away
Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are
Things past redress are now with me past care        Exeunt
SCENE 4
A camp in Wales
Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a WELSH CAPTAIN
And hardly kept our countrymen together
And yet we hear no tidings from the King
Therefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell
SALISBURY Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman
The King reposeth all his confidence in thee
And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
The one in fear to lose what they enjoy
The other to enjoy by rage and war
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings
Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled
SALISBURY Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind
I see thy glory like a shooting star
Fall to the base earth from the firmament
The sun sets weeping in the lowly west
Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest
Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes               Exit

ACT III SCENE I
Enter BOLINGBROKE YORK NORTHUMBERLAND PERCY ROSS WILLOUGHBY
BUSHY and GREEN prisoners
BOLINGBROKE Bring forth these men
With too much urging your pernicious lives
From off my hands here in the view of men
I will unfold some causes of your deaths
You have misled a prince a royal king
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
By you unhappied and disfigured clean
You have in manner with your sinful hours
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
Broke the possession of a royal bed
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
Near to the King in blood and near in love
Eating the bitter bread of banishment
Whilst you have fed upon my signories
From my own windows torn my household coat
To show the world I am a gentleman
This and much more much more than twice all this
Condemns you to the death See them delivered over
To execution and the hand of death
BUSHY More welcome is the stroke of death to me
Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell
GREEN My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
And plague injustice with the pains of hell
Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others with the prisoners
Uncle you say the Queen is at your house
Tell her I send to her my kind commends
Take special care my greetings be delivered
With letters of your love to her at large
BOLINGBROKE Thanks gentle uncle Come lords away
To fight with Glendower and his complices
Awhile to work and after holiday                    Exeunt
SCENE 2
The coast of Wales A castle in view
Drums Flourish and colours Enter the KING the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
AUMERLE and soldiers
KING RICHARD Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand
AUMERLE Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air
After your late tossing on the breaking seas
KING RICHARD Needs must I like it well I weep for joy
To stand upon my kingdom once again
Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
And do thee favours with my royal hands
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
Which with usurping steps do trample thee
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
Mock not my senseless conjuration lords
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
Prove armed soldiers ere her native king
CARLISLE Fear not my lord that Power that made you king
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all
And not neglected else if heaven would
The proffered means of succour and redress
AUMERLE He means my lord that we are too remiss
Whilst Bolingbroke through our security
Grows strong and great in substance and in power
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
Behind the globe that lights the lower world
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
In murders and in outrage boldly here
But when from under this terrestrial ball
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
And darts his light through every guilty hole
Then murders treasons and detested sins
Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke
Shall see us rising in our throne the east
His treasons will sit blushing in his face
Not able to endure the sight of day
Not all the water in the rough rude sea
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king
The breath of worldly men cannot depose
The deputy elected by the Lord
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
A glorious angel Then if angels fight
Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
Enter SALISBURY
Welcome my lord How far off lies your power
SALISBURY Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue
And bids me speak of nothing but despair
One day too late I fear me noble lord
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth
O call back yesterday bid time return
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead
AUMERLE Comfort my liege why looks your Grace so pale
KING RICHARD But now the blood of twenty thousand men
Did triumph in my face and they are fled
And till so much blood thither come again
Have I not reason to look pale and dead
All souls that will be safe fly from my side
For time hath set a blot upon my pride
AUMERLE Comfort my liege remember who you are
KING RICHARD I had forgot myself am I not King
Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
At thy great glory Look not to the ground
Ye favourites of a king are we not high
High be our thoughts I know my uncle York
Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here
Enter SCROOP
SCROOP More health and happiness betide my liege
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
And what loss is it to be rid of care
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we
Greater he shall not be if he serve God
Revolt our subjects That we cannot mend
They break their faith to God as well as us
The worst is death and death will have his day
To bear the tidings of calamity
Like an unseasonable stormy day
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
So high above his limits swells the rage
Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown
Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
Against thy seat both young and old rebel
And all goes worse than I have power to tell
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot
What is become of Bushy Where is Green
That they have let the dangerous enemy
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps
If we prevail their heads shall pay for it
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke
SCROOP Peace have they made with him indeed my lord
Dogs easily won to fawn on any man
Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas
Would they make peace Terrible hell make war
Upon their spotted souls for this offence
SCROOP Sweet love I see changing his property
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate
Again uncurse their souls their peace is made
With heads and not with hands those whom you curse
AUMERLE Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead
SCROOP Ay all of them at Bristow lost their heads
AUMERLE Where is the Duke my father with his power
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
Save our deposed bodies to the ground
And nothing can we can our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones
And tell sad stories of the death of kings
That rounds the mortal temples of a king
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
Allowing him a breath a little scene
Infusing him with self and vain conceit
As if this flesh which walls about our life
Comes at the last and with a little pin
Bores through his castle wall and farewell king
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence throw away respect
Tradition form and ceremonious duty
For you have but mistook me all this while
I live with bread like you feel want
Taste grief need friends subjected thus
How can you say to me I am a king
But presently prevent the ways to wail
To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
And so your follies fight against yourself
And fight and die is death destroying death
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath
AUMERLE My father hath a power inquire of him
And learn to make a body of a limb
To change blows with thee for our day of doom
An easy task it is to win our own
Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power
Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
SCROOP Men judge by the complexion of the sky
The state in inclination of the day
So may you by my dull and heavy eye
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
I play the torturer by small and small
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken
And all your northern castles yielded up
And all your southern gentlemen in arms
Upon his party
KING RICHARD Thou hast said enough
Of that sweet way I was in to despair
What say you now What comfort have we now
That bids me be of comfort any more
That power I have discharge and let them go
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow
For I have none Let no man speak again
To alter this for counsel is but vain
AUMERLE My liege one word
KING RICHARD He does me double wrong
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
Discharge my followers let them hence away
SCENE 3
Wales Before Flint Castle
Enter with drum and colours BOLINGBROKE YORK NORTHUMBERLAND
and forces
BOLINGBROKE So that by this intelligence we learn
Is gone to meet the King who lately landed
With some few private friends upon this coast
NORTHUMBERLAND The news is very fair and good my lord
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head
YORK It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
When such a sacred king should hide his head
NORTHUMBERLAND Your Grace mistakes only to be brief
Left I his title out
YORK The time hath been
Would you have been so brief with him he would
Have been so brief with you to shorten you
BOLINGBROKE Mistake not uncle further than you should
YORK Take not good cousin further than you should
Lest you mistake The heavens are over our heads
BOLINGBROKE I know it uncle and oppose not myself
Against their will But who comes here
Enter PERCY
Welcome Harry What will not this castle yield
Against thy entrance
BOLINGBROKE Royally
Why it contains no king
PERCY Yes my good lord
It doth contain a king King Richard lies
Within the limits of yon lime and stone
And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury
Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman
Of holy reverence who I cannot learn
NORTHUMBERLAND O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
Henry Bolingbroke
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
To his most royal person hither come
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power
The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
It is such crimson tempest should bedrench
My stooping duty tenderly shall show
Go signify as much while here we march
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
With no less terror than the elements
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
The rage be his whilst on the earth I rain
March on and mark King Richard how he looks
Parle without and answer within then a flourish
Enter on the walls the KING the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
AUMERLE SCROOP and SALISBURY
See see King Richard doth himself appear
As doth the blushing discontented sun
From out the fiery portal of the east
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
To dim his glory and to stain the track
Of his bright passage to the occident
YORK Yet he looks like a king Behold his eye
Controlling majesty Alack alack for woe
That any harm should stain so fair a show
have we stood
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee
Because we thought ourself thy lawful King
And if we be how dare thy joints forget
To pay their awful duty to our presence
If we be not show us the hand of God
For well we know no hand of blood and bone
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
Unless he do profane steal or usurp
And though you think that all as you have done
Have torn their souls by turning them from us
And we are barren and bereft of friends
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
Armies of pestilence and they shall strike
Your children yet unborn and unbegot
That lift your vassal hands against my head
And threat the glory of my precious crown
Tell Bolingbroke for yon methinks he stands
That every stride he makes upon my land
Is dangerous treason he is come to open
The purple testament of bleeding war
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace
To scarlet indignation and bedew
NORTHUMBERLAND The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King
Should so with civil and uncivil arms
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
And by the honourable tomb he swears
And by the royalties of both your bloods
Currents that spring from one most gracious head
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt
And by the worth and honour of himself
Comprising all that may be sworn or said
His coming hither hath no further scope
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
Enfranchisement immediate on his knees
Which on thy royal party granted once
His glittering arms he will commend to rust
His barbed steeds to stables and his heart
To faithful service of your Majesty
This swears he as he is a prince is just
And as I am a gentleman I credit him
KING RICHARD Northumberland say thus the King returns
His noble cousin is right welcome hither
And all the number of his fair demands
With all the gracious utterance thou hast
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
To look so poorly and to speak so fair
Shall we call back Northumberland and send
Defiance to the traitor and so die
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
That laid the sentence of dread banishment
On yon proud man should take it off again
With words of sooth O that I were as great
As is my grief or lesser than my name
Or that I could forget what I have been
Or not remember what I must be now
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
AUMERLE Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke
KING RICHARD What must the King do now Must he submit
The King shall be contented Must he lose
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage
My subjects for a pair of carved saints
And my large kingdom for a little grave
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live
And buried once why not upon my head
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
And make a dearth in this revolting land
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
And make some pretty match with shedding tears
As thus to drop them still upon one place
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
Would not this ill do well Well well I see
I talk but idly and you laugh at me
Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland
What says King Bolingbroke Will his Majesty
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die
You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay
NORTHUMBERLAND My lord in the base court he doth attend
To speak with you may it please you to come down
Wanting the manage of unruly jades
In the base court Base court where kings grow base
In the base court Come down Down court down king
Exeunt from above
BOLINGBROKE What says his Majesty
NORTHUMBERLAND Sorrow and grief of heart
Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
Yet he is come
Enter the KING and his attendants below
BOLINGBROKE Stand all apart
KING RICHARD Fair cousin you debase your princely knee
To make the base earth proud with kissing it
Me rather had my heart might feel your love
Up cousin up your heart is up I know
knee be low
BOLINGBROKE My gracious lord I come but for mine own
KING RICHARD Your own is yours and I am yours and all
BOLINGBROKE So far be mine my most redoubted lord
As my true service shall deserve your love
KING RICHARD Well you deserve They well deserve to have
Uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes
Tears show their love but want their remedies
Cousin I am too young to be your father
Though you are old enough to be my heir
For do we must what force will have us do
Set on towards London Cousin is it so
BOLINGBROKE Yea my good lord
KING RICHARD Then I must not say no         Flourish Exeunt
SCENE 4
Enter the QUEEN and two LADIES
QUEEN What sport shall we devise here in this garden
To drive away the heavy thought of care
And that my fortune runs against the bias
QUEEN My legs can keep no measure in delight
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief
Therefore no dancing girl some other sport
QUEEN Of sorrow or of joy
LADY Of either madam
QUEEN Of neither girl
For if of joy being altogether wanting
It doth remember me the more of sorrow
Or if of grief being altogether had
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy
For what I have I need not to repeat
And what I want it boots not to complain
But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
LADY I could weep madam would it do you good
QUEEN And I could sing would weeping do me good
And never borrow any tear of thee
Enter a GARDENER and two SERVANTS
But stay here come the gardeners
My wretchedness unto a row of pins
They will talk of state for every one doth so
Against a change woe is forerun with woe
GARDENER Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
Which like unruly children make their sire
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight
Give some supportance to the bending twigs
Go thou and Eke an executioner
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
That look too lofty in our commonwealth
All must be even in our government
The noisome weeds which without profit suck
SERVANT Why should we in the compass of a pale
Keep law and form and due proportion
Showing as in a model our firm estate
Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs
Swarming with caterpillars
GARDENER Hold thy peace
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green
SERVANT What are they dead
GARDENER They are and Bolingbroke
As we this garden We at time of year
Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees
With too much riches it confound itself
Had he done so to great and growing men
Their fruits of duty Superfluous branches
We lop away that bearing boughs may live
Had he done so himself had home the crown
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
SERVANT What think you the King shall be deposed
That tell black tidings
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
What Eve what serpent hath suggested the
To make a second fall of cursed man
Divine his downfall Say where when and how
GARDENER Pardon me madam little joy have
To breathe this news yet what I say is true
King Richard he is in the mighty hold
And some few vanities that make him light
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke
Besides himself are all the English peers
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down
Post you to London and you will find it so
I speak no more than every one doth know
QUEEN Nimble mischance that art so light of foot
Doth not thy embassage belong to me
And am I last that knows it O thou thinkest
To serve me last that I may longest keep
Thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go
What was I born to this that my sad look
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke
Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES
GARDENER Poor Queen so that thy state might be no worse
I would my skill were subject to thy curse
Here did she fall a tear here in this place
Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
In the remembrance of a weeping queen                Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE 1
Westminster Hall
Enter as to the Parliament BOLINGBROKE AUMERLE NORTHUMBERLAND PERCY
FITZWATER SURREY the BISHOP OF CARLISLE the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER
and others HERALD OFFICERS and BAGOT
BOLINGBROKE Call forth Bagot
The bloody office of his timeless end
BAGOT Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle
BOLINGBROKE Cousin stand forth and look upon that man
BAGOT My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue
That reacheth from the restful English Court
Amongst much other talk that very time
I heard you say that you had rather refuse
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
Adding withal how blest this land would be
AUMERLE Princes and noble lords
What answer shall I make to this base man
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars
On equal terms to give him chastisement
With the attainder of his slanderous lips
There is my gage the manual seal of death
That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest
And will maintain what thou hast said is false
To stain the temper of my knightly sword
BOLINGBROKE Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
AUMERLE Excepting one I would he were the best
FITZWATER If that thy valour stand on sympathy
There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine
If thou deniest it twenty times thou liest
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
FITZWATER Now by my soul I would it were this hour
PERCY Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
In this appeal as thou art an unjust
And that thou art so there I throw my gage
To prove it on thee to the extremest point
AUMERLE An if I do not may my hands rot of
And never brandish more revengeful steel
Over the glittering helmet of my foe
ANOTHER LORD I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle
And spur thee on with fun as many lies
Engage it to the trial if thou darest
I have a thousand spirits in one breast
To answer twenty thousand such as you
SURREY My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well
The very time Aumerle and you did talk
And you can witness with me this is true
SURREY As false by heaven as heaven itself is true
FITZWATER Surrey thou liest
SURREY Dishonourable boy
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
That it shall render vengeance and revenge
FITZWATER How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness
And spit upon him whilst I say he lies
And lies and lies There is my bond of faith
To tie thee to my strong correction
As I intend to thrive in this new world
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal
That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men
To execute the noble Duke at Calais
AUMERLE Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
That Norfolk lies Here do I throw down this
BOLINGBROKE These differences shall all rest under gage
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial
CARLISLE That honourable day shall never be seen
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
Against black pagans Turks and Saracens
To Italy and there at Venice gave
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ
Under whose colours he had fought so long
BOLINGBROKE Why Bishop is Norfolk dead
CARLISLE As surely as I live my lord
BOLINGBROKE Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
Of good old Abraham Lords appellants
Your differences shall all rest under gage
Till we assign you to your days of trial
Enter YORK attended
YORK Great Duke of Lancaster I come to the
Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
To the possession of thy royal hand
And long live Henry fourth of that name
CARLISLE Marry God forbid
Worst in this royal presence may I speak
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
Would God that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard Then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
What subject can give sentence on his king
Although apparent guilt be seen in them
His captain steward deputy elect
Anointed crowned planted many years
And he himself not present O forfend it God
Should show so heinous black obscene a deed
I speak to subjects and a subject speaks
My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king
The blood of English shall manure the ground
And future ages groan for this foul act
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
Disorder horror fear and mutiny
O if you raise this house against this house
It will the woefullest division prove
That ever fell upon this cursed earth
Prevent it resist it let it not be so
NORTHUMBERLAND Well have you argued sir and for your pains
Of capital treason we arrest you here
My Lord of Westminster be it your charge
To keep him safely till his day of trial
BOLINGBROKE Fetch hither Richard that in common view
He may surrender so we shall proceed
Without suspicion
YORK I will be his conduct                              Exit
BOLINGBROKE Lords you that here are under our arrest
Procure your sureties for your days of answer
Little are we beholding to your love
bearing the regalia
KING RICHARD Alack why am I sent for to a king
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
To insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
To this submission Yet I well remember
The favours of these men Were they not mine
So Judas did to Christ but he in twelve
Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none
God save the King Will no man say amen
Am I both priest and clerk Well then amen
God save the King although I be not he
And yet amen if heaven do think him me
To do what service am I sent for hither
YORK To do that office of thine own good will
The resignation of thy state and crown
To Henry Bolingbroke
KING RICHARD Give me the crown Here cousin seize the crown
Here cousin
On this side my hand and on that side thine
Now is this golden crown like a deep well
That owes two buckets filling one another
The emptier ever dancing in the air
The other down unseen and full of water
That bucket down and fun of tears am I
Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
BOLINGBROKE I thought you had been willing to resign
KING RICHARD My crown I am but still my griefs are mine
You may my glories and my state depose
But not my griefs still am I king of those
BOLINGBROKE Part of your cares you give me with your crown
KING RICHARD Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
My care is loss of care by old care done
Your care is gain of care by new care won
The cares I give I have though given away
They tend the crown yet still with me they stay
BOLINGBROKE Are you contented to resign the crown
KING RICHARD Ay no no ay for I must nothing be
Therefore no no for I resign to thee
Now mark me how I will undo myself
I give this heavy weight from off my head
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart
With mine own tears I wash away my balm
With mine own hands I give away my crown
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state
With mine own breath release all duteous oaths
All pomp and majesty I do forswear
My manors rents revenues I forgo
My acts decrees and statutes I deny
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me
God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit
And send him many years of sunshine days
What more remains
NORTHUMBERLAND No more but that you read
These accusations and these grievous crimes
Committed by your person and your followers
Against the state and profit of this land
That by confessing them the souls of men
KING RICHARD Must I do so And must I ravel out
If thy offences were upon record
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst
There shouldst thou find one heinous article
Containing the deposing of a king
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath
Nay all of you that stand and look upon me
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
And water cannot wash away your sin
articles
KING RICHARD Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see
And yet salt water blinds them not so much
But they can see a sort of traitors here
Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself
I find myself a traitor with the rest
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave
Proud majesty a subject state a peasant
KING RICHARD No lord of thine thou haught insulting man
That I have worn so many winters out
And know not now what name to call myself
O that I were a mockery king of snow
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke
To melt myself away in water drops
Good king great king and yet not greatly good
An if my word be sterling yet in England
Let it command a mirror hither straight
That it may show me what a face I have
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty
Exit an attendant
KING RICHARD Fiend thou torments me ere I come to hell
BOLINGBROKE Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland
NORTHUMBERLAND The Commons will not then be satisfied
When I do see the very book indeed
Give me that glass and therein will I read
No deeper wrinkles yet Hath sorrow struck
So many blows upon this face of mine
Like to my followers in prosperity
Thou dost beguile me Was this face the face
That every day under his household roof
Did keep ten thousand men Was this the face
That like the sun did make beholders wink
A brittle glory shineth in this face
As brittle as the glory is the face
The shadow of your face
KING RICHARD Say that again
And these external manner of laments
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
There lies the substance and I thank thee king
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
And then be gone and trouble you no more
Shall I obtain it
BOLINGBROKE Name it fair cousin
KING RICHARD Fair cousin I am greater than a king
For when I was a king my flatterers
Were then but subjects being now a subject
I have a king here to my flatterer
Being so great I have no need to beg
BOLINGBROKE Yet ask
KING RICHARD And shall I have
BOLINGBROKE You shall
KING RICHARD Then give me leave to go
BOLINGBROKE Whither
KING RICHARD Whither you will so I were from your sights
BOLINGBROKE Go some of you convey him to the Tower
KING RICHARD O good Convey Conveyers are you all
Exeunt KING RICHARD some Lords and a Guard
BOLINGBROKE On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
Our coronation Lords prepare yourselves
Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER the
BISHOP OF CARLISLE and AUMERLE
ABBOT A woeful pageant have we here beheld
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
AUMERLE You holy clergymen is there no plot
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot
ABBOT My lord
Before I freely speak my mind herein
You shall not only take the sacrament
To bury mine intents but also to effect
Whatever I shall happen to devise
I see your brows are full of discontent
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears
Come home with me to supper I will lay
A plot shall show us all a merry day                 Exeunt

ACT V SCENE 1
London A street leading to the Tower
Enter the QUEEN with her attendants
QUEEN This way the King will come this is the way
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
Here let us rest if this rebellious earth
Enter KING RICHARD and Guard
But soft but see or rather do not see
My fair rose wither Yet look up behold
That you in pity may dissolve to dew
Ah thou the model where old Troy did stand
And not King Richard thou most beauteous inn
When triumph is become an alehouse guest
KING RICHARD Join not with grief fair woman do not so
To make my end too sudden Learn good soul
To think our former state a happy dream
Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet
To grim Necessity and he and
Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France
And cloister thee in some religious house
Which our profane hours here have thrown down
QUEEN What is my Richard both in shape and mind
Thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
Take the correction mildly kiss the rod
And fawn on rage with base humility
Which art a lion and the king of beasts
KING RICHARD A king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts
I had been still a happy king of men
Good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for France
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
Of woeful ages long ago betid
And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
And send the hearers weeping to their beds
For why the senseless brands will sympathize
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
And in compassion weep the fire out
For the deposing of a rightful king
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND attended
You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower
With all swift speed you must away to France
KING RICHARD Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne
The time shall not be many hours of age
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think
Though he divide the realm and give thee half
It is too little helping him to all
And he shall think that thou which knowest the way
To plant unrightful kings wilt know again
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
The love of wicked men converts to fear
That fear to hate and hate turns one or both
To worthy danger and deserved death
NORTHUMBERLAND My guilt be on my head and there an end
Take leave and part for you must part forthwith
And then betwixt me and my married wife
Part us Northumberland I towards the north
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp
She came adorned hither like sweet May
QUEEN And must we be divided Must we part
KING RICHARD Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
QUEEN Banish us both and send the King with me
NORTHUMBERLAND That were some love but little policy
QUEEN Then whither he goes thither let me go
KING RICHARD So two together weeping make one woe
Weep thou for me in France I for thee here
Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans
QUEEN So longest way shall have the longest moans
And piece the way out with a heavy heart
Since wedding it there is such length in grief
One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart
So now I have mine own again be gone
That I may strive to kill it with a groan
KING RICHARD We make woe wanton with this fond delay
Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say            Exeunt
SCENE 2
Enter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS
DUCHESS My Lord you told me you would tell the rest
When weeping made you break the story off
YORK Where did I leave
DUCHESS At that sad stop my lord
YORK Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
With slow but stately pace kept on his course
You would have thought the very windows spake
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes
Upon his visage and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once
Whilst he from the one side to the other turning
DUCHESS Alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst
YORK As in a theatre the eyes of men
Are idly bent on him that enters next
Thinking his prattle to be tedious
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
His face still combating with tears and smiles
The badges of his grief and patience
The hearts of men they must perforce have melted
And barbarism itself have pitied him
But heaven hath a hand in these events
To whose high will we bound our calm contents
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
Whose state and honour I for aye allow
DUCHESS Here comes my son Aumerle
YORK Aumerle that was
And madam you must call him Rudand now
I am in Parliament pledge for his truth
Enter AUMERLE
DUCHESS Welcome my son Who are the violets now
That strew the green lap of the new come spring
AUMERLE Madam I know not nor I greatly care not
God knows I had as lief be none as one
YORK Well bear you well in this new spring of time
What news from Oxford Do these justs and triumphs hold
AUMERLE For aught I know my lord they do
YORK You will be there I know
AUMERLE If God prevent not I purpose so
YORK What seal is that that without thy bosom
YORK No matter then who see it
I will be satisfied let me see the writing
AUMERLE I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
It is a matter of small consequence
Which for some reasons I would not have seen
YORK Which for some reasons sir I mean to see
DUCHESS What should you fear
YORK Bound to himself What doth he with a bond
That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool
Boy let me see the writing
AUMERLE I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it
YORK I will be satisfied let me see it I say
Treason foul treason Villain traitor slave
DUCHESS What is the matter my lord
YORK Ho who is within there
Enter a servant
Saddle my horse
God for his mercy what treachery is here
DUCHESS Why York what is it my lord
YORK Give me my boots I say saddle my horse
Exit servant
Now by mine honour by my life my troth
I will appeach the villain
DUCHESS What is the matter
YORK Peace foolish woman
DUCHESS I will not peace What is the matter Aumerle
AUMERLE Good mother be content it is no more
Than my poor life must answer
DUCHESS Thy life answer
YORK Bring me my boots I will unto the King
His man enters with his boots
Hence villain never more come in my sight
YORK Give me my boots I say
DUCHESS Why York what wilt thou do
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
Have we more sons or are we like to have
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
Is he not like thee Is he not thine own
YORK Thou fond mad woman
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
And interchangeably set down their hands
To kill the King at Oxford
DUCHESS He shall be none
YORK Away fond woman were he twenty times my son
I would appeach him
As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect
That I have been disloyal to thy bed
And that he is a bastard not thy son
Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind
He is as like thee as a man may be
Not like to me or any of my kin
And yet I love him
YORK Make way unruly woman                             Exit
DUCHESS After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse
Spur post and get before him to the King
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York
And never will I rise up from the ground
Exeunt
SCENE 3
Windsor Castle
Enter BOLINGBROKE as King PERCY and other LORDS
BOLINGBROKE Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
I would to God my lords he might be found
For there they say he daily doth frequent
With unrestrained loose companions
Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
And beat our watch and rob our passengers
Which he young wanton and effeminate boy
Takes on the point of honour to support
So dissolute a crew
PERCY My lord some two days since I saw the Prince
And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford
BOLINGBROKE And what said the gallant
PERCY His answer was he would unto the stews
And wear it as a favour and with that
He would unhorse the lustiest challenger
BOLINGBROKE As dissolute as desperate yet through both
I see some sparks of better hope which elder years
May happily bring forth But who comes here
Enter AUMERLE amazed
AUMERLE Where is the King
BOLINGBROKE What means our cousin that he stares and looks
So wildly
AUMERLE God save your Grace I do beseech your Majesty
To have some conference with your Grace alone
BOLINGBROKE Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
Exeunt PERCY and LORDS
What is the matter with our cousin now
AUMERLE For ever may my knees grow to the earth
My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak
BOLINGBROKE Intended or committed was this fault
AUMERLE Then give me leave that I may turn the key
That no man enter till my tale be done
BOLINGBROKE Have thy desire
Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there
AUMERLE Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear
Shall I for love speak treason to thy face
Open the door or I will break it open
Enter YORK
BOLINGBROKE What is the matter uncle Speak
Recover breath tell us how near is danger
That we may arm us to encounter it
YORK Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
The treason that my haste forbids me show
I do repent me read not my name there
My heart is not confederate with my hand
YORK It was villain ere thy hand did set it down
Fear and not love begets his penitence
Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
A serpent that will sting thee to the heart
BOLINGBROKE O heinous strong and bold conspiracy
O loyal father of a treacherous son
Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
From whence this stream through muddy passages
Thy overflow of good converts to bad
And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
This deadly blot in thy digressing son
And he shall spend mine honour with his shame
Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
Speak with me pity me open the door
My dangerous cousin let your mother in
I know she is come to pray for your foul sin
YORK If thou do pardon whosoever pray
More sins for this forgiveness prosper may
This let alone will all the rest confound
Enter DUCHESS
Love loving not itself none other can
YORK Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
DUCHESS Sweet York be patient Hear me gentle liege
BOLINGBROKE Rise up good aunt
DUCHESS Not yet I thee beseech
For ever will I walk upon my knees
And never see day that the happy sees
Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy
YORK Against them both my true joints bended be
Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
DUCHESS Pleads he in earnest Look upon his face
His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
His words come from his mouth ours from our breast
He prays but faintly and would be denied
We pray with heart and soul and all beside
His weary joints would gladly rise I know
Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity
That mercy which true prayer ought to have
BOLINGBROKE Good aunt stand up
An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
The word is short but not so short as sweet
DUCHESS Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
That sets the word itself against the word
The chopping French we do not understand
Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
BOLINGBROKE Good aunt stand up
DUCHESS I do not sue to stand
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand
BOLINGBROKE I pardon him as God shall pardon me
DUCHESS O happy vantage of a kneeling knee
Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again
But makes one pardon strong
BOLINGBROKE With all my heart
I pardon him
DUCHESS A god on earth thou art
With all the rest of that consorted crew
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
Good uncle help to order several powers
They shall not live within this world I swear
But I will have them if I once know where
Uncle farewell and cousin adieu
DUCHESS Come my old son I pray God make thee new      Exeunt
SCENE 4
Windsor Castle
Enter SIR PIERCE OF EXTON and a servant
EXTON Didst thou not mark the King what words he spake
Was it not so
SERVANT These were his very words
SERVANT He did
SCENE 5
Pomfret Castle The dungeon of the Castle
Enter KING RICHARD
KING RICHARD I have been studying how I may compare
This prison where I live unto the world
And for because the world is populous
And here is not a creature but myself
My soul the father and these two beget
And these same thoughts people this little world
In humours like the people of this world
For no thought is contented The better sort
With scruples and do set the word itself
Against the word
Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world my ragged prison walls
And for they cannot die in their own pride
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
That many have and others must sit there
And in this thought they find a kind of ease
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Thus play I in one person many people
And none contented Sometimes am I king
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
And so I am Then crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king
Nor I nor any man that but man is
Music do I hear
Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is
When time is broke and no proportion kept
And here have I the daintiness of ear
But for the concord of my state and time
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke
I wasted time and now doth time waste me
My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans
Show minutes times and hours but my time
While I stand fooling here his Jack of the clock
This music mads me Let it sound no more
For though it have holp madmen to their wits
In me it seems it will make wise men mad
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
Enter a GROOM of the stable
GROOM Hail royal Prince
KING RICHARD Thanks noble peer
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
What art thou and how comest thou hither
Where no man never comes but that sad dog
That brings me food to make misfortune live
GROOM I was a poor groom of thy stable King
When thou wert king who travelling towards York
With much ado at length have gotten leave
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid
KING RICHARD Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend
How went he under him
KING RICHARD So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him
Would he not stumble would he not fall down
Since pride must have a fall and break the neck
Of that proud man that did usurp his back
Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee
Wast born to bear I was not made a horse
And yet I bear a burden like an ass
Enter KEEPER with meat
KEEPER Fellow give place here is no longer stay
GROOM my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
Exit
KING RICHARD Taste of it first as thou art wont to do
KEEPER My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton
Who lately came from the King commands the contrary
KING RICHARD The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee
Patience is stale and I am weary of it
KEEPER Help help help
The murderers EXTON and servants rush in armed
KING RICHARD How now What means death in this rude assault
Go thou and fill another room in hell
That staggers thus my person Exton thy fierce hand
Mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
EXTON As full of valour as of royal blood
For now the devil that told me I did well
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell
Take hence the rest and give them burial here       Exeunt
SCENE 6
Windsor Castle
Flourish Enter BOLINGBROKE the DUKE OF YORK With other LORDS
and attendants
BOLINGBROKE Kind uncle York the latest news we hear
Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND
Welcome my lord What is the news
NORTHUMBERLAND First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness
The next news is I have to London sent
The heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kent
The manner of their taking may appear
At large discoursed in this paper here
BOLINGBROKE We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains
Enter FITZWATER
FITZWATER My lord I have from Oxford sent to London
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow
BOLINGBROKE Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot
Right noble is thy merit well I wot
Enter PERCY With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE
PERCY The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
Hath yielded up his body to the grave
But here is Carlisle living to abide
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
BOLINGBROKE Carlisle this is your doom
Choose out some secret place some reverend room
More than thou hast and with it joy thy life
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen
Enter EXTON with attendants hearing a coffin
EXTON Great King within this coffin I present
Thy buried fear Herein all breathless lies
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies
Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought
BOLINGBROKE Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
Upon my head and all this famous land
EXTON From your own mouth my lord did I this deed
BOLINGBROKE They love not poison that do poison need
Nor do I thee Though I did wish him dead
I hate the murderer love him murdered
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour
But neither my good word nor princely favour
With Cain go wander thorough shades of night
And never show thy head by day nor light
Lords I protest my soul is full of woe
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow
Come mourn with me for what I do lament
And put on sullen black incontinent
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand
March sadly after grace my mournings here
In weeping after this untimely bier                  Exeunt

SCENE England
King Richard the Third
ACT I SCENE 1
London A street
Enter RICHARD DUKE OF GLOUCESTER solus
GLOUCESTER Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
And now instead of mounting barbed steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature
Into this breathing world scarce half made up
And that so lamely and unfashionable
Why I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous
By drunken prophecies libels and dreams
To set my brother Clarence and the King
In deadly hate the one against the other
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle false and treacherous
About a prophecy which says that G
Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes
Enter CLARENCE guarded and BRAKENBURY
Brother good day What means this armed guard
That waits upon your Grace
CLARENCE His Majesty
GLOUCESTER Upon what cause
CLARENCE Because my name is George
GLOUCESTER Alack my lord that fault is none of yours
He should for that commit your godfathers
O belike his Majesty hath some intent
CLARENCE Yea Richard when I know for I protest
As yet I do not but as I can learn
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams
And says a wizard told him that by G
His issue disinherited should be
And for my name of George begins with G
It follows in his thought that I am he
These as I learn and such like toys as these
That tempers him to this extremity
Was it not she and that good man of worship
Antony Woodville her brother there
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower
From whence this present day he is delivered
We are not safe Clarence we are not safe
CLARENCE By heaven I think there is no man is secure
That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore
Heard you not what an humble suppliant
Lord Hastings was for her delivery
GLOUCESTER Humbly complaining to her deity
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty
If we will keep in favour with the King
To be her men and wear her livery
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy
BRAKENBURY I beseech your Graces both to pardon me
His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
That no man shall have private conference
Of what degree soever with your brother
You may partake of any thing we say
We speak no treason man we say the King
Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
Well struck in years fair and not jealous
A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
How say you sir Can you deny all this
BRAKENBURY With this my lord myself have naught to do
GLOUCESTER Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee
fellow
He that doth naught with her excepting one
Were best to do it secretly alone
BRAKENBURY What one my lord
GLOUCESTER Her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me
BRAKENBURY I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and
withal
Forbear your conference with the noble Duke
CLARENCE We know thy charge Brakenbury and will
obey
Brother farewell I will unto the King
I will perform it to enfranchise you
Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
Touches me deeper than you can imagine
CLARENCE I know it pleaseth neither of us well
GLOUCESTER Well your imprisonment shall not be long
I will deliver or else lie for you
Meantime have patience
CLARENCE I must perforce Farewell
Exeunt CLARENCE BRAKENBURY and guard
Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven
If heaven will take the present at our hands
Enter LORD HASTINGS
HASTINGS Good time of day unto my gracious lord
GLOUCESTER As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain
Well are you welcome to the open air
HASTINGS With patience noble lord as prisoners must
But I shall live my lord to give them thanks
That were the cause of my imprisonment
GLOUCESTER No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too
For they that were your enemies are his
Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
GLOUCESTER What news abroad
HASTINGS No news so bad abroad as this at home
The King is sickly weak and melancholy
And his physicians fear him mightily
GLOUCESTER Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed
O he hath kept an evil diet long
Where is he In his bed
HASTINGS He is
GLOUCESTER Go you before and I will follow you
Exit HASTINGS
He cannot live I hope and must not die
And if I fail not in my deep intent
Clarence hath not another day to live
Which done God take King Edward to his mercy
And leave the world for me to bustle in
The readiest way to make the wench amends
Is to become her husband and her father
As for another secret close intent
By marrying her which I must reach unto
But yet I run before my horse to market
Clarence still breathes Edward still lives and reigns
When they are gone then must I count my gains         Exit
SCENE 2
London Another street
Enter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH with halberds to guard it
LADY ANNE being the mourner attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne
Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son
Lo in these windows that let forth thy life
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
O cursed be the hand that made these holes
Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
More direful hap betide that hated wretch
That makes us wretched by the death of thee
Than I can wish to adders spiders toads
If ever he have child abortive be it
Prodigious and untimely brought to light
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
May fright the hopeful mother at the view
And that be heir to his unhappiness
If ever he have wife let her be made
More miserable by the death of him
Than I am made by my young lord and thee
Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load
And still as you are weary of this weight
Enter GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER Stay you that bear the corse and set it down
ANNE What black magician conjures up this fiend
To stop devoted charitable deeds
GLOUCESTER Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul
FIRST GENTLEMAN My lord stand back and let the coffin
pass
GLOUCESTER Unmannerd dog Stand thou when I command
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast
And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
ANNE What do you tremble Are you all afraid
Alas I blame you not for you are mortal
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body
His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
GLOUCESTER Sweet saint for charity be not so curst
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries
Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
Provokes this deluge most unnatural
Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
GLOUCESTER Lady you know no rules of charity
Which renders good for bad blessings for curses
ANNE Villain thou knowest nor law of God nor man
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
GLOUCESTER But I know none and therefore am no beast
ANNE O wonderful when devils tell the truth
GLOUCESTER More wonderful when angels are so angry
Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
Of these supposed crimes to give me leave
By circumstance but to acquit myself
Of these known evils but to give me leave
By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
GLOUCESTER Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
Some patient leisure to excuse myself
ANNE Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
No excuse current but to hang thyself
GLOUCESTER By such despair I should accuse myself
ANNE And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself
That didst unworthy slaughter upon others
GLOUCESTER Say that I slew them not
ANNE Then say they were not slain
But dead they are and devilish slave by thee
GLOUCESTER I did not kill your husband
ANNE Why then he is alive
ANNE In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw
The which thou once didst bend against her breast
But that thy brothers beat aside the point
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
ANNE Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
Didst thou not kill this king
GLOUCESTER I grant ye
ANNE Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me to
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
O he was gentle mild and virtuous
GLOUCESTER The better for the King of Heaven that hath
him
ANNE He is in heaven where thou shalt never come
GLOUCESTER Let him thank me that holp to send him
thither
For he was fitter for that place than earth
ANNE And thou unfit for any place but hell
GLOUCESTER Yes one place else if you will hear me name it
ANNE Some dungeon
ANNE Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
GLOUCESTER So will it madam till I lie with you
ANNE I hope so
GLOUCESTER I know so But gentle Lady Anne
To leave this keen encounter of our wits
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward
As blameful as the executioner
Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom
ANNE If I thought that I tell thee homicide
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
wreck
You should not blemish it if I stood by
As all the world is cheered by the sun
So I by that it is my day my life
GLOUCESTER Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
GLOUCESTER It is a quarrel most unnatural
ANNE It is a quarrel just and reasonable
GLOUCESTER He that bereft thee lady of thy husband
Did it to help thee to a better husband
ANNE His better doth not breathe upon the earth
GLOUCESTER He lives that loves thee better than he could
ANNE Name him
GLOUCESTER Plantagenet
ANNE Why that was he
ANNE Where is he
at me
ANNE Would it were mortal poison for thy sake
GLOUCESTER Never came poison from so sweet a place
ANNE Never hung poison on a fouler toad
Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes
GLOUCESTER Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
ANNE Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
GLOUCESTER I would they were that I might die at once
For now they kill me with a living death
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
These eyes which never shed remorseful tear
No when my father York and Edward wept
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
Nor when thy warlike father like a child
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale
Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
I never sued to friend nor enemy
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
Teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made
For kissing lady not for such contempt
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke
And humbly beg the death upon my knee
Take up the sword again or take up me
ANNE Arise dissembler though I wish thy death
I will not be thy executioner
GLOUCESTER Then bid me kill myself and I will do it
ANNE I have already
GLOUCESTER That was in thy rage
Speak it again and even with the word
This hand which for thy love did kill thy love
Shall for thy love kill a far truer love
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
ANNE I would I knew thy heart
ANNE I fear me both are false
GLOUCESTER Then never was man true
ANNE well put up your sword
GLOUCESTER Say then my peace is made
ANNE That shalt thou know hereafter
GLOUCESTER But shall I live in hope
ANNE All men I hope live so
GLOUCESTER Vouchsafe to wear this ring
GLOUCESTER Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
Wear both of them for both of them are thine
And if thy poor devoted servant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
ANNE What is it
GLOUCESTER That it may please you leave these sad designs
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner
And presently repair to Crosby House
I will with all expedient duty see you
For divers unknown reasons I beseech you
Grant me this boon
ANNE With all my heart and much it joys me too
To see you are become so penitent
Tressel and Berkeley go along with me
GLOUCESTER Bid me farewell
But since you teach me how to flatter you
Imagine I have said farewell already
Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE
GLOUCESTER Sirs take up the corse
GENTLEMEN Towards Chertsey noble lord
GLOUCESTER No to White Friars there attend my coming
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Was ever woman in this humour won
With curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
The bleeding witness of my hatred by
Having God her conscience and these bars against me
And I no friends to back my suit at all
But the plain devil and dissembling looks
And yet to win her all the world to nothing
Hath she forgot already that brave prince
Edward her lord whom I some three months since
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet abase her eyes on me
And made her widow to a woeful bed
On me that halts and am misshapen thus
My dukedom to a beggarly denier
I do mistake my person all this while
Upon my life she finds although I cannot
And entertain a score or two of tailors
To study fashions to adorn my body
Since I am crept in favour with myself
I will maintain it with some little cost
And then return lamenting to my love
Shine out fair sun till I have bought a glass
That I may see my shadow as I pass                     Exit
SCENE 3
London The palace
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH LORD RIVERS and LORD GREY
GREY In that you brook it ill it makes him worse
And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes
QUEEN ELIZABETH If he were dead what would betide on
GREY No other harm but loss of such a lord
QUEEN ELIZABETH The loss of such a lord includes all
harms
To be your comforter when he is gone
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester
A man that loves not me nor none of you
RIVER Is it concluded he shall be Protector
But so it must be if the King miscarry
Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY
GREY Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby
BUCKINGHAM Good time of day unto your royal Grace
DERBY God make your Majesty joyful as you have been
QUEEN ELIZABETH The Countess Richmond good my Lord
of Derby
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen
I hate not you for her proud arrogance
DERBY I do beseech you either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers
Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds
From wayward sickness and no grounded malice
Derby
DERBY But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his Majesty
QUEEN ELIZABETH What likelihood of his amendment
Lords
BUCKINGHAM Madam good hope his Grace speaks
cheerfully
QUEEN ELIZABETH God grant him health Did you confer
with him
BUCKINGHAM Ay madam he desires to make atonement
Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers
And between them and my Lord Chamberlain
And sent to warn them to his royal presence
QUEEN ELIZABETH Would all were well But that will
never be
I fear our happiness is at the height
Enter GLOUCESTER HASTINGS and DORSET
GLOUCESTER They do me wrong and I will not endure it
Who is it that complains unto the King
That I forsooth am stern and love them not
By holy Paul they love his Grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
Because I cannot flatter and look fair
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy
I must be held a rancorous enemy
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm
With silken sly insinuating Jacks
GREY To who in all this presence speaks your Grace
GLOUCESTER To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
Or thee or thee or any of your faction
Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints
QUEEN ELIZABETH Brother of Gloucester you mistake the
matter
The King on his own royal disposition
Aiming belike at your interior hatred
That in your outward action shows itself
Makes him to send that he may learn the ground
GLOUCESTER I cannot tell the world is grown so bad
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
Since every Jack became a gentleman
QUEEN ELIZABETH Come come we know your meaning
brother Gloucester
God grant we never may have need of you
GLOUCESTER Meantime God grants that I have need of you
Held in contempt while great promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce some two days since were worth a noble
height
I never did incense his Majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him
My lord you do me shameful injury
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
GLOUCESTER You may deny that you were not the mean
GLOUCESTER She may Lord Rivers Why who knows
not so
She may do more sir than denying that
She may help you to many fair preferments
And then deny her aiding hand therein
And lay those honours on your high desert
RIVERS What marry may she
GLOUCESTER What marry may she Marry with a king
A bachelor and a handsome stripling too
Iwis your grandam had a worser match
QUEEN ELIZABETH My Lord of Gloucester I have too long
borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
By heaven I will acquaint his Majesty
Enter old QUEEN MARGARET behind
beseech Him
Thy honour state and seat is due to me
GLOUCESTER What Threat you me with telling of the
King
Tell him and spare not Look what I have said
QUEEN MARGARET Out devil I do remember them to
well
And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury
GLOUCESTER Ere you were queen ay or your husband
King
A liberal rewarder of his friends
To royalize his blood I spent mine own
QUEEN MARGARET Ay and much better blood than his or
thine
GLOUCESTER In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster
And Rivers so were you Was not your husband
Let me put in your minds if you forget
What you have been ere this and what you are
Withal what I have been and what I am
GLOUCESTER Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick
QUEEN MARGARET Which God revenge
And for his meed poor lord he is mewed up
QUEEN MARGARET Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this
world
Thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
RIVERS My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies
So should we you if you should be our king
GLOUCESTER If I should be I had rather be a pedlar
Far be it from my heart the thought thereof
QUEEN ELIZABETH As little joy my lord as you suppose
As little joy you may suppose in me
That I enjoy being the Queen thereof
QUEEN MARGARET As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof
For I am she and altogether joyless
Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
Which of you trembles not that looks on me
If not that I am Queen you bow like subjects
Ah gentle villain do not turn away
sight
That will I make before I let thee go
GLOUCESTER Wert thou not banished on pain of death
QUEEN MARGARET I was but I do find more pain in
banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode
And thou a kingdom all of you allegiance
This sorrow that I have by right is yours
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine
GLOUCESTER The curse my noble father laid on thee
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
His curses then from bitterness of soul
QUEEN ELIZABETH So just is God to right the innocent
RIVERS Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
DORSET No man but prophesied revenge for it
BUCKINGHAM Northumberland then present wept to see it
QUEEN MARGARET What were you snarling all before I came
Ready to catch each other by the throat
And turn you all your hatred now on me
Should all but answer for that peevish brat
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
Though not by war by surfeit die your king
As ours by murder to make him a king
Edward thy son that now is Prince of Wales
For Edward our son that was Prince of Wales
Die in his youth by like untimely violence
Thyself a queen for me that was a queen
Outlive thy glory like my wretched self
And see another as I see thee now
Long die thy happy days before thy death
Rivers and Dorset you were standers by
And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son
That none of you may live his natural age
hag
QUEEN MARGARET And leave out thee Stay dog for thou
shalt hear me
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee
O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
And then hurl down their indignation
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
Unless it be while some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
The slave of nature and the son of hell
GLOUCESTER Margaret
QUEEN MARGARET Richard
GLOUCESTER Ha
QUEEN MARGARET I call thee not
GLOUCESTER I cry thee mercy then for I did think
O let me make the period to my curse
against yourself
QUEEN MARGARET Poor painted queen vain flourish of my
fortune
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience
QUEEN MARGARET Foul shame upon you you have all
duty
QUEEN MARGARET To serve me well you all should do me
duty
Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects
O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
DORSET Dispute not with her she is lunatic
QUEEN MARGARET Peace Master Marquis you are malapert
O that your young nobility could judge
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
GLOUCESTER Good counsel marry learn it learn it Marquis
DORSET It touches you my lord as much as me
GLOUCESTER Ay and much more but I was born so high
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
Witness my son now in the shade of death
Hath in eternal darkness folded up
O God that seest it do not suffer it
As it is won with blood lost be it so
BUCKINGHAM Peace peace for shame if not for charity
QUEEN MARGARET Urge neither charity nor shame to me
Uncharitably with me have you dealt
My charity is outrage life my shame
BUCKINGHAM Have done have done
hand
In sign of league and amity with thee
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood
Nor thou within the compass of my curse
BUCKINGHAM Nor no one here for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air
QUEEN MARGARET I will not think but they ascend the sky
O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog
Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
His venom tooth will rankle to the death
Have not to do with him beware of him
Sin death and hell have set their marks on him
And all their ministers attend on him
GLOUCESTER What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM Nothing that I respect my gracious lord
QUEEN MARGARET What dost thou scorn me for my gentle
counsel
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from
O but remember this another day
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess
Live each of you the subjects to his hate
BUCKINGHAM My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
She hath had too much wrong and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her
QUEEN ELIZABETH I never did her any to my knowledge
GLOUCESTER Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
I was too hot to do somebody good
That is too cold in thinking of it now
Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid
God pardon them that are the cause thereof
To pray for them that have done scathe to us
Enter CATESBY
CATESBY Madam his Majesty doth can for you
And for your Grace and you my gracious lords
QUEEN ELIZABETH Catesby I come Lords will you go
with me
RIVERS We wait upon your Grace
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
GLOUCESTER I do the wrong and first begin to brawl
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others
Clarence who I indeed have cast in darkness
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely to Derby Hastings Buckingham
That stir the King against the Duke my brother
Now they believe it and withal whet me
But then I sigh and with a piece of Scripture
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil
And thus I clothe my naked villainy
And seem a saint when most I play the devil
Enter two MURDERERS
But soft here come my executioners
How now my hardy stout resolved mates
Are you now going to dispatch this thing
FIRST MURDERER We are my lord and come to have the
warrant
That we may be admitted where he is
GLOUCESTER Well thought upon I have it here about me
When you have done repair to Crosby Place
But sirs be sudden in the execution
Withal obdurate do not hear him plead
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him
FIRST MURDERER Tut tut my lord we will not stand to
prate
We go to use our hands and not our tongues
tears
I like you lads about your business straight
Go go dispatch
FIRST MURDERER We will my noble lord                 Exeunt
SCENE 4
London The Tower
Enter CLARENCE and KEEPER
So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights
That as I am a Christian faithful man
I would not spend another such a night
So full of dismal terror was the time
KEEPER What was your dream my lord I pray you
tell me
CLARENCE Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
And in my company my brother Gloucester
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
And cited up a thousand heavy times
During the wars of York and Lancaster
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches
Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling
Struck me that thought to stay him overboard
Into the tumbling billows of the main
O Lord methought what pain it was to drown
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears
What sights of ugly death within my eyes
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks
Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
Inestimable stones unvalued jewels
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
KEEPER Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep
CLARENCE Methought I had and often did I strive
To yield the ghost but still the envious flood
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea
O then began the tempest to my soul
With that sour ferryman which poets write of
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night
The first that there did greet my stranger soul
A shadow like an angel with bright hair
With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
Such hideous cries that with the very noise
Could not believe but that I was in hell
Such terrible impression made my dream
KEEPER No marvel lord though it affrighted you
I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
CLARENCE Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things
That now give evidence against my soul
O God If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee
Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone
O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
KEEPER I prithee sit by me awhile
My soul is heavy and I fain would sleep
KEEPER I will my lord God give your Grace good rest
Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant
BRAKENBURY Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
Makes the night morning and the noontide night
Princes have but their titles for their glories
An outward honour for an inward toil
And for unfelt imaginations
They often feel a world of restless cares
So that between their tides and low name
Enter the two MURDERERS
thou hither
FIRST MURDERER I would speak with Clarence and I came
hither on my legs
BRAKENBURY What so brief
him see our commission and talk no more
BRAKENBURY I am in this commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands
I will not reason what is meant hereby
Because I will be guiltless from the meaning
There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys
you well                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER
SECOND MURDERER What shall I stab him as he sleeps
he wakes
SECOND MURDERER Why he shall never wake until the great
sleeping
SECOND MURDERER The urging of that word judgment hath
bred a kind of remorse in me
FIRST MURDERER What art thou afraid
SECOND MURDERER Not to kill him having a warrant but to
defend me
FIRST MURDERER I thought thou hadst been resolute
SECOND MURDERER So I am to let him live
tell him so
SECOND MURDERER Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this
passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to
hold me but while one tells twenty
FIRST MURDERER How dost thou feel thyself now
SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience
are yet within me
done
SECOND MURDERER Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward
FIRST MURDERER When he opens his purse to give us our
reward thy conscience flies out
none will entertain it
FIRST MURDERER What if it come to thee again
coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man
cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his
full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold
and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust
to himself and live without it
persuading me not to kill the Duke
SECOND MURDERER Take the devil in thy mind and believe
him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the
sigh
SECOND MURDERER Spoke like a tall man that respects thy
reputation Come shall we fall to work
FIRST MURDERER Take him on the costard with the hilts of
next room
SECOND MURDERER O excellent device and make a sop of
him
FIRST MURDERER Soft he wakes
SECOND MURDERER Strike
CLARENCE Where art thou Keeper Give me a cup of wine
SECOND MURDERER You shall have wine enough my lord
anon
FIRST MURDERER A man as you are
CLARENCE But not as I am royal
SECOND MURDERER Nor you as we are loyal
CLARENCE Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
mine own
CLARENCE How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
Your eyes do menace me Why look you pale
Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come
CLARENCE To murder me
BOTH MURDERERS Ay ay
CLARENCE You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
Wherein my friends have I offended you
FIRST MURDERER Offended us you have not but the King
SECOND MURDERER Never my lord therefore prepare to die
CLARENCE Are you drawn forth among a world of men
To slay the innocent What is my offence
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Before I be convict by course of law
To threaten me with death is most unlawful
I charge you as you hope to have redemption
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable
FIRST MURDERER What we will do we do upon command
SECOND MURDERER And he that hath commanded is our
King
CLARENCE Erroneous vassals the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder Will you then
Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand
To hurl upon their heads that break his law
SECOND MURDERER And that same vengeance doth he hurl
on thee
For false forswearing and for murder too
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster
FIRST MURDERER And like a traitor to the name of God
Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
SECOND MURDERER Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and
defend
to us
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree
CLARENCE Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed
For Edward for my brother for his sake
He sends you not to murder me for this
For in that sin he is as deep as I
If God will be avenged for the deed
O know you yet He doth it publicly
He needs no indirect or lawless course
To cut off those that have offended Him
FIRST MURDERER Who made thee then a bloody minister
That princely novice was struck dead by thee
faults
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
CLARENCE If you do love my brother hate not me
I am his brother and I love him well
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death
hates you
CLARENCE O no he loves me and he holds me dear
Go you to him from me
FIRST MURDERER Ay so we will
CLARENCE Tell him when that our princely father York
He little thought of this divided friendship
Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep
CLARENCE O do not slander him for he is kind
FIRST MURDERER Right as snow in harvest Come you
deceive yourself
CLARENCE It cannot be for he bewept my fortune
That he would labour my delivery
FIRST MURDERER Why so he doth when he delivers you
SECOND MURDERER Make peace with God for you must die
my lord
CLARENCE Have you that holy feeling in your souls
To counsel me to make my peace with God
And are you yet to your own souls so blind
O sirs consider they that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed
SECOND MURDERER What shall we do
CLARENCE Relent and save your souls
CLARENCE Not to relent is beastly savage devilish
Being pent from liberty as I am now
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you
Would not entreat for life
My friend I spy some pity in thy looks
O if thine eye be not a flatterer
As you would beg were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not
SECOND MURDERER Look behind you my lord
this will not do
Exit with the body
SECOND MURDERER A bloody deed and desperately
How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous murder
By heavens the Duke shall know how slack you have
been
brother
Take thou the fee and tell him what I say
For I repent me that the Duke is slain                 Exit
FIRST MURDERER So do not I Go coward as thou art
Till that the Duke give order for his burial
And when I have my meed I will away
For this will out and then I must not stay            Exit

Flourish Enter KING EDWARD sick QUEEN ELIZABETH DORSET RIVERS
HASTINGS BUCKINGHAM GREY and others
work
You peers continue this united league
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence
And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven
Since I have made my friends at peace on earth
Dissemble not your hatred swear your love
HASTINGS So thrive I as I truly swear the like
KING EDWARD Take heed you dally not before your king
Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood and award
HASTINGS So prosper I as I swear perfect love
RIVERS And I as I love Hastings with my heart
KING EDWARD Madam yourself is not exempt from this
Nor you son Dorset Buckingham nor you
You have been factious one against the other
Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand
And what you do do it unfeignedly
QUEEN ELIZABETH There Hastings I will never more
remember
Our former hatred so thrive I and mine
KING EDWARD Dorset embrace him Hastings love Lord
Marquis
DORSET This interchange of love I here protest
Upon my part shall be inviolable
KING EDWARD Now princely Buckingham seal thou this
league
And make me happy in your unity
doth turn his hate
Upon your Grace but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love
When I have most need to employ a friend
And most assured that he is a friend
Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
Be he unto me This do I beg of God
When I am cold in love to you or yours
KING EDWARD A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
To make the blessed period of this peace
BUCKINGHAM And in good time
Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke
Enter GLOUCESTER and RATCLIFF
GLOUCESTER Good morrow to my sovereign king and
Queen
And princely peers a happy time of day
KING EDWARD Happy indeed as we have spent the day
Gloucester we have done deeds of charity
Made peace of enmity fair love of hate
GLOUCESTER A blessed labour my most sovereign lord
Among this princely heap if any here
By false intelligence or wrong surmise
If I unwittingly or in my rage
Have aught committed that is hardly borne
To any in this presence I desire
To reconcile me to his friendly peace
First madam I entreat true peace of you
Which I will purchase with my duteous service
Of you my noble cousin Buckingham
Of you and you Lord Rivers and of Dorset
Of you Lord Woodville and Lord Scales of you
I do not know that Englishman alive
With whom my soul is any jot at odds
I thank my God for my humility
QUEEN ELIZABETH A holy day shall this be kept hereafter
I would to God all strifes were well compounded
My sovereign lord I do beseech your Highness
To take our brother Clarence to your grace
To be so flouted in this royal presence
Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead
You do him injury to scorn his corse
KING EDWARD Who knows not he is dead Who knows
he is
BUCKINGHAM Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest
DORSET Ay my good lord and no man in the presence
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
GLOUCESTER But he poor man by your first order died
And that a winged Mercury did bear
Some tardy cripple bare the countermand
That came too lag to see him buried
God grant that some less noble and less loyal
Nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did
And yet go current from suspicion
Enter DERBY
DERBY A boon my sovereign for my service done
KING EDWARD I prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow
DERBY I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me
KING EDWARD Then say at once what is it thou requests
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
And yet his punishment was bitter death
Who sued to me for him Who in my wrath
Who spoke of brotherhood Who spoke of love
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
The mighty Warwick and did fight for me
Who told me in the field at Tewksbury
When Oxford had me down he rescued me
Who told me when we both lay in the field
Frozen almost to death how he did lap me
Even in his garments and did give himself
All thin and naked to the numb cold night
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
Had so much race to put it in my mind
The precious image of our dear Redeemer
You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
But for my brother not a man would speak
Nor I ungracious speak unto myself
For him poor soul The proudest of you all
Have been beholding to him in his life
Yet none of you would once beg for his life
O God I fear thy justice will take hold
On me and you and mine and yours for this
Come Hastings help me to my closet Ah poor Clarence
Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN
How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
O they did urge it still unto the King
God will revenge it Come lords will you go
To comfort Edward with our company
BUCKINGHAM We wait upon your Grace                    Exeunt
SCENE 2
London The palace
Enter the old DUCHESS OF YORK with the SON and DAUGHTER of CLARENCE
SON Good grandam tell us is our father dead
DUCHESS No boy
DAUGHTER Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast
SON Why do you look on us and shake your head
And call us orphans wretches castaways
If that our noble father were alive
DUCHESS My pretty cousins you mistake me both
I do lament the sickness of the King
SON Then you conclude my grandam he is dead
The King mine uncle is to blame for it
God will revenge it whom I will importune
With earnest prayers all to that effect
DAUGHTER And so will I
DUCHESS Peace children peace The King doth love you
well
Incapable and shallow innocents
SON Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester
And when my uncle told me so he wept
Bade me rely on him as on my father
And he would love me dearly as a child
DUCHESS Ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape
And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice
He is my son ay and therein my shame
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
SON Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
DUCHESS Ay boy
SON I cannot think it Hark what noise is this
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH with her hair about her
ears RIVERS and DORSET after her
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah who shall hinder me to wail and
weep
To chide my fortune and torment myself
And to myself become an enemy
DUCHESS What means this scene of rude impatience
QUEEN ELIZABETH To make an act of tragic violence
EDWARD my lord thy son our king is dead
Why grow the branches when the root is gone
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap
If you will live lament if die be brief
Or like obedient subjects follow him
DUCHESS Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow
As I had title in thy noble husband
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
And I for comfort have but one false glass
That grieves me when I see my shame in him
Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
And hast the comfort of thy children left
To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
How can we aid you with our kindred tears
QUEEN ELIZABETH Give me no help in lamentation
I am not barren to bring forth complaints
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward
CHILDREN Ah for our father for our dear Lord Clarence
DUCHESS Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence
gone
DUCHESS What stays had I but they and they are gone
QUEEN ELIZABETH Was never widow had so dear a loss
CHILDREN Were never orphans had so dear a loss
DUCHESS Was never mother had so dear a loss
Alas I am the mother of these griefs
She for an Edward weeps and so do I
I for a Clarence weep so doth not she
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I
I for an Edward weep so do not they
And I will pamper it with lamentation
That you take with unthankfulness his doing
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven
For it requires the royal debt it lent you
RIVERS Madam bethink you like a careful mother
Of the young prince your son Send straight for him
Enter GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM DERBY
HASTINGS and RATCLIFF
GLOUCESTER Sister have comfort All of us have cause
To wail the dimming of our shining star
But none can help our harms by wailing them
Madam my mother I do cry you mercy
I did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee
I crave your blessing
DUCHESS God bless thee and put meekness in thy breast
Love charity obedience and true duty
man
I marvel that her Grace did leave it out
peers
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan
Though we have spent our harvest of this king
We are to reap the harvest of his son
Me seemeth good that with some little train
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet
RIVERS Why with some little train my Lord of
Buckingham
BUCKINGHAM Marry my lord lest by a multitude
Which would be so much the more dangerous
Where every horse bears his commanding rein
And may direct his course as please himself
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent
In my opinion ought to be prevented
GLOUCESTER I hope the King made peace with all of us
And the compact is firm and true in me
RIVERS And so in me and so I think in an
Yet since it is but green it should be put
To no apparent likelihood of breach
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham
That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince
HASTINGS And so say I
GLOUCESTER Then be it so and go we to determine
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow
Madam and you my sister will you go
To give your censures in this business
Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER
BUCKINGHAM My lord whoever journeys to the Prince
For God sake let not us two stay at home
My oracle my prophet my dear cousin
I as a child will go by thy direction

SECOND CITIZEN I promise you I scarcely know myself
Hear you the news abroad
FIRST CITIZEN Yes that the King is dead
better
Enter another CITIZEN
THIRD CITIZEN Neighbours God speed
FIRST CITIZEN Give you good morrow sir
death
SECOND CITIZEN Ay sir it is too true God help the while
THIRD CITIZEN Then masters look to see a troublous
world
reign
SECOND CITIZEN In him there is a hope of government
Which in his nonage council under him
And in his full and ripened years himself
No doubt shall then and till then govern well
FIRST CITIZEN So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
THIRD CITIZEN Stood the state so No no good friends
God wot
With politic grave counsel then the King
Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace
FIRST CITIZEN Why so hath this both by his father and
mother
THIRD CITIZEN Better it were they all came by his father
Or by his father there were none at all
For emulation who shall now be nearest
Will touch us all too near if God prevent not
O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester
This sickly land might solace as before
FIRST CITIZEN Come come we fear the worst all will be
well
THIRD CITIZEN When clouds are seen wise men put on
their cloaks
When great leaves fall then winter is at hand
When the sun sets who doth not look for night
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth
All may be well but if God sort it so
SECOND CITIZEN Truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
You cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and fun of dread
THIRD CITIZEN Before the days of change still is it so
Ensuing danger as by proof we see
But leave it all to God Whither away
SECOND CITIZEN Marry we were sent for to the justices
Exeunt

QUEEN ELIZABETH But I hear no they say my son of York
YORK Ay mother but I would not have it so
DUCHESS Why my good cousin it is good to grow
YORK Grandam one night as we did sit at supper
And since methinks I would not grow so fast
DUCHESS Good faith good faith the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee
That if his rule were true he should be gracious
ARCHBISHOP And so no doubt he is my gracious madam
DUCHESS I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
DUCHESS How my young York I prithee let me hear it
YORK Marry they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
Grandam this would have been a biting jest
DUCHESS I prithee pretty York who told thee this

MESSENGER The mighty Dukes Gloucester and Buckingham
ARCHBISHOP For what offence

QUEEN ELIZABETH Ay me I see the ruin of my house
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne
Welcome destruction blood and massacre
I see as in a map the end of all
DUCHESS Accursed and unquiet wrangling days
How many of you have mine eyes beheld
My husband lost his life to get the crown
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss
And being seated and domestic broils
Blood to blood self against self O preposterous
And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
Or let me die to look on death no more
QUEEN ELIZABETH Come come my boy we will to
sanctuary
Madam farewell
DUCHESS Stay I will go with you
QUEEN ELIZABETH You have no cause
And thither bear your treasure and your goods
The seal I keep and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours

ACT III SCENE 1
London A street
The trumpets sound Enter the PRINCE OF WALES GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM
CATESBY CARDINAL BOURCHIER and others
BUCKINGHAM Welcome sweet Prince to London to your
chamber
The weary way hath made you melancholy
PRINCE No uncle but our crosses on the way
Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
I want more uncles here to welcome me
GLOUCESTER Sweet Prince the untainted virtue of your
years
Nor more can you distinguish of a man
Than of his outward show which God He knows
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
Those uncles which you want were dangerous
God keep you from them and from such false friends
PRINCE God keep me from false friends but they were
none
GLOUCESTER My lord the Mayor of London comes to greet
you
Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train
MAYOR God bless your Grace with health and happy days
PRINCE I thank you good my lord and thank you all
I thought my mother and my brother York
Would long ere this have met us on the way
Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not
To tell us whether they will come or no
Enter LORD HASTINGS
BUCKINGHAM And in good time here comes the sweating
Lord
PRINCE Welcome my lord What will our mother come
HASTINGS On what occasion God He knows not I
The Queen your mother and your brother York
Have taken sanctuary The tender Prince
Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace
But by his mother was perforce withheld
BUCKINGHAM Fie what an indirect and peevish course
Is this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace
Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
Unto his princely brother presently
If she deny Lord Hastings go with him
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
CARDINAL My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory
Can from his mother win the Duke of York
Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid
We should infringe the holy privilege
Of blessed sanctuary Not for all this land
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin
Too ceremonious and traditional
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age
You break not sanctuary in seizing him
The benefit thereof is always granted
And those who have the wit to claim the place
And therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
Then taking him from thence that is not there
You break no privilege nor charter there
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men
But sanctuary children never till now
Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me
HASTINGS I go my lord
PRINCE Good lords make all the speedy haste you may
Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS
Say uncle Gloucester if our brother come
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation
GLOUCESTER Where it seems best unto your royal self
If I may counsel you some day or two
Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit
For your best health and recreation
PRINCE I do not like the Tower of any place
Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord
BUCKINGHAM He did my gracious lord begin that place
PRINCE Is it upon record or else reported
Successively from age to age he built it
BUCKINGHAM Upon record my gracious lord
Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age
live long
PRINCE What say you uncle
GLOUCESTER I say without characters fame lives long
I moralize two meanings in one word
PRINCE That Julius Caesar was a famous man
With what his valour did enrich his wit
His wit set down to make his valour live
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror
For now he lives in fame though not in life
BUCKINGHAM What my gracious lord
PRINCE An if I live until I be a man
spring
Enter HASTINGS young YORK and the CARDINAL
BUCKINGHAM Now in good time here comes the Duke of
York
PRINCE Richard of York how fares our loving brother
YORK Well my dread lord so must I can you now
PRINCE Ay brother to our grief as it is yours
Too late he died that might have kept that title
Which by his death hath lost much majesty
GLOUCESTER How fares our cousin noble Lord of York
YORK I thank you gentle uncle O my lord
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far
GLOUCESTER He hath my lord
YORK And therefore is he idle
GLOUCESTER O my fair cousin I must not say so
YORK Then he is more beholding to you than I
GLOUCESTER He may command me as my sovereign
But you have power in me as in a kinsman
YORK I pray you uncle give me this dagger
GLOUCESTER My dagger little cousin With all my heart
PRINCE A beggar brother
YORK Of my kind uncle that I know will give
And being but a toy which is no grief to give
GLOUCESTER Ay gentle cousin were it light enough
YORK O then I see you will part but with light gifts
GLOUCESTER It is too heavy for your Grace to wear
YORK I weigh it lightly were it heavier
GLOUCESTER What would you have my weapon little
Lord
YORK I would that I might thank you as you call me
GLOUCESTER How
YORK Little
PRINCE My Lord of York will still be cross in talk
Uncle your Grace knows how to bear with him
YORK You mean to bear me not to bear with me
Uncle my brother mocks both you and me
Because that I am little like an ape
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
He prettily and aptly taunts himself
So cunning and so young is wonderful
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
Will to your mother to entreat of her
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you
YORK What will you go unto the Tower my lord
PRINCE My Lord Protector needs will have it so
YORK I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower
GLOUCESTER Why what should you fear
PRINCE I fear no uncles dead
GLOUCESTER Nor none that live I hope
PRINCE An if they live I hope I need not fear
But come my lord and with a heavy heart
Thinking on them go I unto the Tower
A sennet
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM Think you my lord this little prating York
Was not incensed by his subtle mother
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
Bold quick ingenious forward capable
BUCKINGHAM Well let them rest Come hither Catesby
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
As closely to conceal what we impart
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
For the instalment of this noble Duke
In the seat royal of this famous isle
That he will not be won to aught against him
not he
CATESBY He will do all in all as Hastings doth
BUCKINGHAM Well then no more but this go gentle
Catesby
And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings
How he doth stand affected to our purpose
To sit about the coronation
If thou dost find him tractable to us
Encourage him and tell him all our reasons
If he be leaden icy cold unwilling
Be thou so too and so break off the talk
And give us notice of his inclination
GLOUCESTER Commend me to Lord William Tell him
Catesby
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
And bid my lord for joy of this good news
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more
BUCKINGHAM Good Catesby go effect this business soundly
CATESBY My good lords both with all the heed I can
GLOUCESTER Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep
CATESBY You shall my lord
GLOUCESTER At Crosby House there shall you find us both
Exit CATESBY
BUCKINGHAM Now my lord what shall we do if we
perceive
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots
determine
And look when I am King claim thou of me
The earldom of Hereford and all the movables
GLOUCESTER And look to have it yielded with all kindness
Come let us sup betimes that afterwards
We may digest our complots in some form              Exeunt
SCENE 2
Enter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS
MESSENGER One from the Lord Stanley
MESSENGER Upon the stroke of four
Enter LORD HASTINGS
HASTINGS Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious
nights
MESSENGER So it appears by that I have to say
First he commends him to your noble self
HASTINGS What then
MESSENGER Then certifies your lordship that this night
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
Besides he says there are two councils kept
If you will presently take horse with him
And with all speed post with him toward the north
To shun the danger that his soul divines
HASTINGS Go fellow go return unto thy lord
Bid him not fear the separated council
His honour and myself are at the one
And at the other is my good friend Catesby
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
Whereof I shall not have intelligence
Tell him his fears are shallow without instance
To fly the boar before the boar pursues
Were to incense the boar to follow us
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase
Go bid thy master rise and come to me
And we will both together to the Tower
Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
Exit
Enter CATESBY
CATESBY Many good morrows to my noble lord
HASTINGS Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring
CATESBY It is a reeling world indeed my lord
And I believe will never stand upright
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm
HASTINGS How wear the garland Dost thou mean the
crown
CATESBY Ay my good lord
shoulders
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
CATESBY Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward
Upon his party for the gain thereof
And thereupon he sends you this good news
That this same very day your enemies
The kindred of the Queen must die at Pomfret
HASTINGS Indeed I am no mourner for that news
Because they have been still my adversaries
God knows I will not do it to the death
CATESBY God keep your lordship in that gracious mind
HASTINGS But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence
I live to look upon their tragedy
Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older
HASTINGS O monstrous monstrous And so falls it out
With some men else that think themselves as safe
As thou and I who as thou knowest are dear
To princely Richard and to Buckingham
Enter LORD STANLEY
Fear you the boar and go so unprovided
STANLEY My lord good morrow good morrow Catesby
You may jest on but by the holy rood
I do not like these several councils I
HASTINGS My lord I hold my life as dear as yours
And never in my days I do protest
Think you but that I know our state secure
I would be so triumphant as I am
STANLEY The lords at Pomfret when they rode from
London
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust
This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt
Pray God I say I prove a needless coward
What shall we toward the Tower The day is spent
HASTINGS Come come have with you Wot you what my
Lord
STANLEY They for their truth might better wear their
heads
Enter HASTINGS a pursuivant
Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY
How now Hastings How goes the world with thee
PURSUIVANT The better that your lordship please to ask
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower
This day those enernies are put to death
HASTINGS Gramercy Hastings there drink that for me
PURSUIVANT I thank your honour                          Exit
Enter a PRIEST
PRIEST Well met my lord I am glad to see your honour
HASTINGS I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart
I am in your debt for your last exercise
Come the next Sabbath and I will content you
Enter BUCKINGHAM
BUCKINGHAM What talking with a priest Lord
Chamberlain
Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand
HASTINGS Good faith and when I met this holy man
The men you talk of came into my mind
What go you toward the Tower
BUCKINGHAM I do my lord but long I cannot stay there
I shall return before your lordship thence
HASTINGS Nay like enough for I stay dinner there
Come will you go
SCENE 3
Pomfret Castle
Enter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF with halberds carrying the Nobles
RIVERS GREY and VAUGHAN to death
RIVERS Sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this
For truth for duty and for loyalty
GREY God bless the Prince from all the pack of you
VAUGHAN You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter
RATCLIFF Dispatch the limit of your lives is out
RIVERS O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison
Fatal and ominous to noble peers
Within the guilty closure of thy walls
And for more slander to thy dismal seat
We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink
Buckingham
To hear her prayer for them as now for us
And for my sister and her princely sons
Be satisfied dear God with our true blood
RATCLIFF Make haste the hour of death is expiate
RIVERS Come Grey come Vaughan let us here embrace
Farewell until we meet again in heaven              Exeunt
SCENE 4
London The Tower
Enter BUCKINGHAM DERBY HASTINGS the BISHOP of ELY RATCLIFF LOVEL
with others and seat themselves at a table
HASTINGS Now noble peers the cause why we are met
Is to determine of the coronation
BUCKINGHAM Is all things ready for the royal time
DERBY It is and wants but nomination
herein
Who is most inward with the noble Duke
BISHOP OF ELY Your Grace we think should soonest know
his mind
He knows no more of mine than I of yours
Or I of his my lord than you of mine
Lord Hastings you and he are near in love
HASTINGS I thank his Grace I know he loves me well
But for his purpose in the coronation
His gracious pleasure any way therein
But you my honourable lords may name the time
Enter GLOUCESTER
BISHOP OF ELY In happy time here comes the Duke himself
GLOUCESTER My noble lords and cousins an good morrow
I have been long a sleeper but I trust
My absence doth neglect no great design
Which by my presence might have been concluded
BUCKINGHAM Had you not come upon your cue my lord
I mean your voice for crowning of the King
GLOUCESTER Than my Lord Hastings no man might be
bolder
His lordship knows me well and loves me well
My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn
I saw good strawberries in your garden there
I do beseech you send for some of them
BISHOP of ELY Marry and will my lord with all my heart
Exit
GLOUCESTER Cousin of Buckingham a word with you
Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business
And finds the testy gentleman so hot
That he will lose his head ere give consent
Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM
DERBY We have not yet set down this day of triumph
For I myself am not so well provided
BISHOP OF ELY Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester
I have sent for these strawberries
HASTINGS His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this
morning
When that he bids good morrow with such spirit
Can lesser hide his love or hate than he
For by his face straight shall you know his heart
DERBY What of his heart perceive you in his face
HASTINGS Marry that with no man here he is offended
For were he he had shown it in his looks
GLOUCESTER I pray you all tell me what they deserve
That do conspire my death with devilish plots
Upon my body with their hellish charms
HASTINGS The tender love I bear your Grace my lord
Makes me most forward in this princely presence
I say my lord they have deserved death
GLOUCESTER Then be your eyes the witness of their evil
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me
Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear
I will not dine until I see the same
Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done
The rest that love me rise and follow me
Exeunt all but HASTINGS LOVEL and RATCLIFF
HASTINGS Woe woe for England not a whit for me
For I too fond might have prevented this
STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms
And I did scorn it and disdain to fly
O now I need the priest that spake to me
I now repent I told the pursuivant
As too triumphing how mine enemies
And I myself secure in grace and favour
O Margaret Margaret now thy heavy curse
RATCLIFF Come come dispatch the Duke would be at
dinner
Make a short shrift he longs to see your head
HASTINGS O momentary grace of mortal men
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
Ready with every nod to tumble down
Into the fatal bowels of the deep
HASTINGS O bloody Richard Miserable England
Come lead me to the block bear him my head
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead           Exeunt
SCENE 5
GLOUCESTER Come cousin canst thou quake and change
thy colour
Murder thy breath in middle of a word
And then again begin and stop again
As if thou were distraught and mad with terror
BUCKINGHAM Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian
Speak and look back and pry on every side
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw
Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks
Are at my service like enforced smiles
And both are ready in their offices
At any time to grace my stratagems
But what is Catesby gone
GLOUCESTER He is and see he brings the mayor along
Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY
GLOUCESTER Look to the drawbridge there
BUCKINGHAM Hark a drum
GLOUCESTER Look back defend thee here are enemies
BUCKINGHAM God and our innocence defend and guard us
LOVEL Here is the head of that ignoble traitor
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings
I took him for the plainest harmless creature
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts
That his apparent open guilt omitted
traitor
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester
MAYOR Had he done so
GLOUCESTER What think you we are Turks or Infidels
Or that we would against the form of law
But that the extreme peril of the case
And your good Graces both have well proceeded
To warn false traitors from the like attempts
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore
Which now the loving haste of these our friends
Because my lord I would have had you heard
The traitor speak and timorously confess
The manner and the purpose of his treasons
That you might well have signified the same
Unto the citizens who haply may
Misconster us in him and wail his death
As well as I had seen and heard him speak
And do not doubt right noble Princes both
With all your just proceedings in this cause
BUCKINGHAM Which since you come too late of our intent
Yet witness what you hear we did intend
And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell
Exit LORD MAYOR
GLOUCESTER Go after after cousin Buckingham
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
Only for saying he would make his son
Which by the sign thereof was termed so
Moreover urge his hateful luxury
And bestial appetite in change of lust
Even where his raging eye or savage heart
Without control lusted to make a prey
Nay for a need thus far come near my person
Tell them when that my mother went with child
Of that insatiate Edward noble York
My princely father then had wars in France
And by true computation of the time
Found that the issue was not his begot
Which well appeared in his lineaments
Being nothing like the noble Duke my father
Because my lord you know my mother lives
As if the golden fee for which I plead
Were for myself and so my lord adieu
Castle
Where you shall find me well accompanied
With reverend fathers and well learned bishops
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords           Exit
GLOUCESTER Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw
Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER
Now will I go to take some privy order
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight
And to give order that no manner person
Have any time recourse unto the Princes                Exit
SCENE 6
London A street
Enter a SCRIVENER
SCRIVENER Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings
And mark how well the sequel hangs together
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me
That cannot see this palpable device
Bad is the world and all will come to nought
When such ill dealing must be seen in thought          Exit
SCENE 7
Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM at several doors
GLOUCESTER How now how now What say the citizens
BUCKINGHAM Now by the holy Mother of our Lord
The citizens are mum say not a word
children
BUCKINGHAM I did with his contract with Lady Lucy
And his contract by deputy in France
And his enforcement of the city wives
His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
As being got your father then in France
And his resemblance being not like the Duke
Withal I did infer your lineaments
Being the right idea of your father
Both in your form and nobleness of mind
Laid open all your victories in Scotland
Your discipline in war wisdom in peace
Your bounty virtue fair humility
Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose
And when mine oratory drew toward end
GLOUCESTER And did they so
BUCKINGHAM No so God help me they spake not a word
But like dumb statues or breathing stones
Which when I saw I reprehended them
His answer was the people were not used
To be spoke to but by the Recorder
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself
When he had done some followers of mine own
And even here brake off and came away
GLOUCESTER What tongueless blocks were they Would
they not speak
Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come
BUCKINGHAM The Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
And stand between two churchmen good my lord
And be not easily won to our requests
GLOUCESTER I go and if you plead as well for them
As I can say nay to thee for myself
No doubt we bring it to a happy issue
BUCKINGHAM Go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor
knocks                                      Exit GLOUCESTER
Enter the LORD MAYOR ALDERMEN and citizens
Welcome my lord I dance attendance here
I think the Duke will not be spoke withal
Enter CATESBY
Now Catesby what says your lord to my request
CATESBY He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord
He is within with two right reverend fathers
Divinely bent to meditation
To draw him from his holy exercise
BUCKINGHAM Return good Catesby to the gracious Duke
Tell him myself the Mayor and Aldermen
In deep designs in matter of great moment
No less importing than our general good
Are come to have some conference with his Grace
BUCKINGHAM Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward
But on his knees at meditation
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans
But meditating with two deep divines
Not sleeping to engross his idle body
But praying to enrich his watchful soul
Happy were England would this virtuous prince
Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof
But sure I fear we shall not win him to it
MAYOR Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay
BUCKINGHAM I fear he will Here Catesby comes again
Now Catesby what says his Grace
CATESBY My lord
He wonders to what end you have assembled
Such troops of citizens to come to him
He fears my lord you mean no good to him
BUCKINGHAM Sorry I am my noble cousin should
Suspect me that I mean no good to him
By heaven we come to him in perfect love
And so once more return and tell his Grace
Exit CATESBY
When holy and devout religious men
So sweet is zealous contemplation
Enter GLOUCESTER aloft between two BISHOPS
CATESBY returns
BUCKINGHAM Two props of virtue for a Christian prince
To stay him from the fall of vanity
And see a book of prayer in his hand
True ornaments to know a holy man
Famous Plantagenet most gracious Prince
Lend favourable ear to our requests
And pardon us the interruption
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal
GLOUCESTER My lord there needs no such apology
I do beseech your Grace to pardon me
Who earnest in the service of my God
BUCKINGHAM Even that I hope which pleaseth God above
GLOUCESTER I do suspect I have done some offence
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance
BUCKINGHAM You have my lord Would it might please
your Grace
On our entreaties to amend your fault
GLOUCESTER Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land
BUCKINGHAM Know then it is your fault that you resign
The supreme seat the throne majestical
Your state of fortune and your due of birth
The lineal glory of your royal house
Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
Which to recure we heartily solicit
Your gracious self to take on you the charge
Not as protector steward substitute
But as successively from blood to blood
Your right of birth your empery your own
For this consorted with the citizens
Your very worshipful and loving friends
And by their vehement instigation
In this just cause come I to move your Grace
GLOUCESTER I cannot tell if to depart in silence
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof
Best fitteth my degree or your condition
If not to answer you might haply think
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
Which fondly you would here impose on me
If to reprove you for this suit of yours
Definitively thus I answer you
Your love deserves my thanks but my desert
Unmeritable shuns your high request
First if all obstacles were cut away
And that my path were even to the crown
As the ripe revenue and due of birth
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit
So mighty and so many my defects
Than in my greatness covet to be hid
And much I need to help you were there need
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit
Will well become the seat of majesty
And make no doubt us happy by his reign
The right and fortune of his happy stars
Which God defend that I should wring from him
BUCKINGHAM My lord this argues conscience in your
Grace
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial
All circumstances well considered
To Bona sister to the King of France
These both put off a poor petitioner
Even in the afternoon of her best days
Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
By her in his unlawful bed he got
This Edward whom our manners call the Prince
More bitterly could I expostulate
Save that for reverence to some alive
I give a sparing limit to my tongue
Then good my lord take to your royal self
If not to bless us and the land withal
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
From the corruption of abusing times
MAYOR Do good my lord your citizens entreat you
CATESBY O make them joyful grant their lawful suit
GLOUCESTER Alas why would you heap this care on me
I am unfit for state and majesty
I do beseech you take it not amiss
I cannot nor I will not yield to you
As well we know your tenderness of heart
And gentle kind effeminate remorse
Which we have noted in you to your kindred
But we will plant some other in the throne
To the disgrace and downfall of your house
And in this resolution here we leave you
GLOUCESTER O do not swear my lord of Buckingham
Exeunt BUCKINGHAM MAYOR and citizens
CATESBY Call him again sweet Prince accept their suit
If you deny them all the land will rue it
GLOUCESTER Will you enforce me to a world of cares
Call them again I am not made of stones
But penetrable to your kind entreaties
Albeit against my conscience and my soul
Cousin of Buckingham and sage grave men
Since you will buckle fortune on my back
I must have patience to endure the load
Attend the sequel of your imposition
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
From all the impure blots and stains thereof
For God doth know and you may partly see
How far I am from the desire of this
MAYOR God bless your Grace We see it and will say it
GLOUCESTER In saying so you shall but say the truth
ALL Amen
GLOUCESTER Even when you please for you will have it so
And so most joyfully we take our leave
work again
Farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends        Exeunt

Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester
Daughter well met
ANNE God give your Graces both
A happy and a joyful time of day

Upon the like devotion as yourselves
To gratulate the gentle Princes there
all together
Enter BRAKENBURY
And in good time here the lieutenant comes
Master Lieutenant pray you by your leave
How doth the Prince and my young son of York
BRAKENBURY Right well dear madam By your patience
I may not suffer you to visit them
BRAKENBURY I mean the Lord Protector
QUEEN ELIZABETH The Lord protect him from that kingly
title
Hath he set bounds between their love and me
I am their mother who shall bar me from them
ANNE Their aunt I am in law in love their mother
And take thy office from thee on my peril
BRAKENBURY No madam no I may not leave it so
I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me            Exit
Enter STANLEY
STANLEY Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
Westminster
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah cut my lace asunder
That my pent heart may have some scope to beat
ANNE Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news
DORSET Be of good cheer mother how fares your Grace
QUEEN ELIZABETH O Dorset speak not to me get thee
gone
Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels
If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
And live with Richmond from the reach of hell
Lest thou increase the number of the dead
STANLEY Full of wise care is this your counsel madam
Take all the swift advantage of the hours
You shall have letters from me to my son
In your behalf to meet you on the way
O my accursed womb the bed of death
Whose unavoided eye is murderous
STANLEY Come madam come I in all haste was sent
ANNE And I with all unwillingness will go
O would to God that the inclusive verge
Of golden metal that must round my brow
Anointed let me be with deadly venom
QUEEN ELIZABETH Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory
To feed my humour wish thyself no harm
ANNE No why When he that is my husband now
Which issued from my other angel husband
For making me so young so old a widow
And be thy wife if any be so mad
More miserable by the life of thee
Lo ere I can repeat this curse again
Grossly grew captive to his honey words
Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest
For never yet one hour in his bed
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep
Besides he hates me for my father Warwick
And will no doubt shortly be rid of me
QUEEN ELIZABETH Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining
ANNE No more than with my soul I mourn for yours
DORSET Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory
fortune guide thee
thoughts possess thee
I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen
QUEEN ELIZABETH Stay yet look back with me unto the
Tower
Pity you ancient stones those tender babes
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones
Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
For tender princes use my babies well
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell         Exeunt

Gold were as good as twenty orators
And will no doubt tempt him to anything
KING RICHARD What is his name
PAGE His name my lord is Tyrrel
KING RICHARD I partly know the man Go call him hither
boy                                               Exit PAGE

Enter STANLEY
STANLEY Know my loving lord
The Marquis Dorset as I hear is fled
KING RICHARD Come hither Catesby Rumour it abroad
That Anne my wife is very grievous sick
I will take order for her keeping close
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman
The boy is foolish and I fear not him
That Anne my queen is sick and like to die
About it for it stands me much upon
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me
Exit CATESBY
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
Murder her brothers and then marry her
Uncertain way of gain But I am in
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin
Is thy name Tyrrel

KING RICHARD Art thou indeed
TYRREL Prove me my gracious lord
TYRREL Please you

KING RICHARD Why then thou hast it Two deep enemies
Are they that I would have thee deal upon
TYRREL I mean those bastards in the Tower
TYRREL Let me have open means to come to them

There is no more but so say it is done
And I will love thee and prefer thee for it
TYRREL I will dispatch it straight                      Exit

BUCKINGHAM What says your Highness to my just request
KING RICHARD I do remember me Henry the Sixth
Did prophesy that Richmond should be King
When Richmond was a little peevish boy
KING RICHARD How chance the prophet could not at that
time
Have told me I being by that I should kill him
KING RICHARD Richmond When last I was at Exeter
Because a bard of Ireland told me once
I should not live long after I saw Richmond
BUCKINGHAM I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
BUCKINGHAM Upon the stroke of ten
KING RICHARD Well let it strike
BUCKINGHAM Why let it strike
stroke
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation
BUCKINGHAM May it please you to resolve me in my suit
KING RICHARD Thou troublest me I am not in the vein

BUCKINGHAM And is it thus Repays he my deep service

To Brecknock while my fearful head is on               Exit
SCENE 3
London The palace
Enter TYRREL
TYRREL The tyrannous and bloody act is done
The most arch deed of piteous massacre
That ever yet this land was guilty of
Dighton and Forrest who I did suborn
To do this piece of ruthless butchery
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion
Within their alabaster innocent arms
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk
A book of prayers on their pillow lay
The most replenished sweet work of nature
Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
They could not speak and so I left them both
To bear this tidings to the bloody King
Enter KING RICHARD
And here he comes All health my sovereign lord
KING RICHARD Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news
TYRREL If to have done the thing you gave in charge
Beget your happiness be happy then
For it is done
KING RICHARD But didst thou see them dead
TYRREL I did my lord
KING RICHARD And buried gentle Tyrrel
TYRREL The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them
But where to say the truth I do not know
KING RICHARD Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper
When thou shalt tell the process of their death
Meantime but think how I may do thee good
And be inheritor of thy desire
Farewell till then
TYRREL I humbly take my leave                           Exit
KING RICHARD The son of Clarence have I pent up close
And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night
Now for I know the Britaine Richmond aims
And by that knot looks proudly on the crown
To her go I a jolly thriving wooer
Enter RATCLIFF
RATCLIFF My lord
bluntly
RATCLIFF Bad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond
Is in the field and still his power increaseth
KING RICHARD Ely with Richmond troubles me more near

Then fiery expedition be my wing
Go muster men My counsel is my shield
We must be brief when traitors brave the field       Exeunt
SCENE 4
London Before the palace
Enter old QUEEN MARGARET
QUEEN MARGARET So now prosperity begins to mellow
And drop into the rotten mouth of death
To watch the waning of mine enemies
A dire induction am I witness to
And will to France hoping the consequence
Will prove as bitter black and tragical
Withdraw thee wretched Margaret Who comes here
Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah my poor princes ah my tender
babes
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
Hover about me with your airy wings
QUEEN MARGARET Hover about her say that right for right
Edward Plantagenet why art thou dead
QUEEN MARGARET Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt
QUEEN ELIZABETH Wilt thou O God fly from such gentle
lambs
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
QUEEN MARGARET When holy Harry died and my sweet
son
DUCHESS Dead life blind sight poor mortal living ghost
Brief abstract and record of tedious days
Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood
QUEEN ELIZABETH Ah that thou wouldst as soon afford a
grave
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat
Then would I hide my bones not rest them here
Ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
most reverend
Give mine the benefit of seniory
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand
DUCHESS I had a Richard too and thou didst kill him
QUEEN MARGARET Thou hadst a Clarence too and Richard
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
God witness with me I have wept for thine
QUEEN MARGARET Bear with me I am hungry for revenge
And now I cloy me with beholding it
The other Edward dead to quit my Edward
Young York he is but boot because both they
And the beholders of this frantic play
And send them thither But at hand at hand
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end
Earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
Cancel his bond of life dear God I pray
QUEEN ELIZABETH O thou didst prophesy the time would
come
That I should wish for thee to help me curse
fortune
The presentation of but what I was
The flattering index of a direful pageant
A dream of what thou wast a garish flag
To be the aim of every dangerous shot
A sign of dignity a breath a bubble
A queen in jest only to fill the scene
Where is thy husband now Where be thy brothers
Where be thy two sons Wherein dost thou joy
Where be the bending peers that flattered thee
Where be the thronging troops that followed thee
Decline an this and see what now thou art
For happy wife a most distressed widow
For joyful mother one that wails the name
And left thee but a very prey to time
Having no more but thought of what thou wast
To torture thee the more being what thou art
Thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
From which even here I slip my weary head
And leave the burden of it all on thee
These English woes shall make me smile in France
And teach me how to curse mine enemies
QUEEN MARGARET Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the
days
Compare dead happiness with living woe
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were
And he that slew them fouler than he is
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse
QUEEN ELIZABETH My words are dull O quicken them
with thine
QUEEN MARGARET Thy woes will make them sharp and
pierce like mine                                       Exit
DUCHESS Why should calamity be fun of words
QUEEN ELIZABETH Windy attorneys to their client woes
Airy succeeders of intestate joys
Poor breathing orators of miseries
Let them have scope though what they will impart
Help nothing else yet do they case the heart
The trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims
Enter KING RICHARD and his train marching with
drums and trumpets
KING RICHARD Who intercepts me in my expedition
DUCHESS O she that might have intercepted thee
By strangling thee in her accursed womb
From all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
QUEEN ELIZABETH Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
crown
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
Tell me thou villain slave where are my children
DUCHESS Thou toad thou toad where is thy brother
Clarence
And little Ned Plantagenet his son
QUEEN ELIZABETH Where is the gentle Rivers Vaughan
Grey
DUCHESS Where is kind Hastings
KING RICHARD A flourish trumpets Strike alarum drums
Either be patient and entreat me fair
Or with the clamorous report of war
Thus will I drown your exclamations
DUCHESS Art thou my son
KING RICHARD Ay I thank God my father and yourself
DUCHESS Then patiently hear my impatience
KING RICHARD Madam I have a touch of your condition
That cannot brook the accent of reproof
DUCHESS O let me speak
DUCHESS I will be mild and gentle in my words
KING RICHARD And brief good mother for I am in haste
God knows in torment and in agony
KING RICHARD And came I not at last to comfort you
A grievous burden was thy birth to me
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
Thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
What comfortable hour canst thou name
your Grace
To breakfast once forth of my company
If I be so disgracious in your eye
Let me march on and not offend you madam
Strike up the drum
DUCHESS I prithee hear me speak
KING RICHARD You speak too bitterly
DUCHESS Hear me a word
For I shall never speak to thee again
KING RICHARD So
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
And never more behold thy face again
Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
Which in the day of battle tire thee more
My prayers on the adverse party fight
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
And promise them success and victory
Bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend        Exit
QUEEN ELIZABETH Though far more cause yet much less
spirit to curse
Abides in me I say amen to her
KING RICHARD Stay madam I must talk a word with you
QUEEN ELIZABETH I have no moe sons of the royal blood
For thee to slaughter For my daughters Richard
They shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
And therefore level not to hit their lives
Virtuous and fair royal and gracious
QUEEN ELIZABETH And must she die for this O let her
live
Throw over her the veil of infamy
KING RICHARD Wrong not her birth she is a royal
Princess
KING RICHARD Her life is safest only in her birth
QUEEN ELIZABETH And only in that safety died her
brothers
KING RICHARD Lo at their birth good stars were opposite
QUEEN ELIZABETH No to their lives ill friends were
contrary
KING RICHARD All unavoided is the doom of destiny
QUEEN ELIZABETH True when avoided grace makes destiny
KING RICHARD You speak as if that I had slain my cousins
QUEEN ELIZABETH Cousins indeed and by their uncle
Of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
Thy head an indirectly gave direction
To revel in the entrails of my lambs
But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
KING RICHARD Madam so thrive I in my enterprise
And dangerous success of bloody wars
As I intend more good to you and yours
heaven
KING RICHARD advancement of your children gentle
lady
QUEEN ELIZABETH Up to some scaffold there to lose their
heads
KING RICHARD Unto the dignity and height of Fortune
QUEEN ELIZABETH Flatter my sorrow with report of it
Tell me what state what dignity what honour
Canst thou demise to any child of mine
Will I withal endow a child of thine
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
Which thou supposest I have done to thee
QUEEN ELIZABETH Be brief lest that the process of thy
kindness
KING RICHARD Then know that from my soul I love thy
daughter
soul
KING RICHARD What do you think
QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou dost love my daughter from
thy soul
KING RICHARD Be not so hasty to confound my meaning
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter
And do intend to make her Queen of England
QUEEN ELIZABETH Well then who dost thou mean shall be
her king
KING RICHARD Even he that makes her Queen Who else
should be
QUEEN ELIZABETH What thou
KING RICHARD Even so How think you of it
QUEEN ELIZABETH How canst thou woo her
KING RICHARD That would I learn of you
As one being best acquainted with her humour
QUEEN ELIZABETH And wilt thou learn of me
KING RICHARD Madam with all my heart
QUEEN ELIZABETH Send to her by the man that slew her
brothers
A pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave
A handkerchief which say to her did drain
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
If this inducement move her not to love
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds
Her uncle Rivers ay and for her sake
KING RICHARD You mock me madam this is not the way
To win your daughter
QUEEN ELIZABETH There is no other way
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
And not be Richard that hath done all this
KING RICHARD Say that I did all this for love of her
QUEEN ELIZABETH Nay then indeed she cannot choose but
hate thee
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil
KING RICHARD Look what is done cannot be now amended
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
If I did take the kingdom from your sons
To quicken your increase I will beget
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
Than is the doating title of a mother
They are as children but one step below
Even of your metal of your very blood
Of all one pain save for a night of groans
Your children were vexation to your youth
But mine shall be a comfort to your age
The loss you have is but a son being King
And by that loss your daughter is made Queen
I cannot make you what amends I would
Therefore accept such kindness as I can
Dorset your son that with a fearful soul
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil
This fair alliance quickly shall can home
To high promotions and great dignity
The King that calls your beauteous daughter wife
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother
Again shall you be mother to a king
And all the ruins of distressful times
What we have many goodly days to see
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
Advantaging their loan with interest
Of ten times double gain of happiness
Go then my mother to thy daughter go
Make bold her bashful years with your experience
Of golden sovereignty acquaint the Princes
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
And when this arm of mine hath chastised
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
To whom I will retail my conquest won
brother
Would be her lord Or shall I say her uncle
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
Under what title shall I woo for thee
That God the law my honour and her love
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years
QUEEN ELIZABETH Which she shall purchase with
KING RICHARD Tell her the King that may command
entreats
King forbids
KING RICHARD Say she shall be a high and mighty queen
QUEEN ELIZABETH To wail the title as her mother doth
KING RICHARD Say I will love her everlastingly
QUEEN ELIZABETH But how long fairly shall her sweet life
last
KING RICHARD As long as heaven and nature lengthens it
QUEEN ELIZABETH As long as hell and Richard likes of it
KING RICHARD Say I her sovereign am her subject low
QUEEN ELIZABETH But she your subject loathes such
sovereignty
KING RICHARD Be eloquent in my behalf to her
QUEEN ELIZABETH An honest tale speeds best being plainly
told
KING RICHARD Then plainly to her tell my loving tale
QUEEN ELIZABETH Plain and not honest is too harsh a style
KING RICHARD Your reasons are too shallow and too quick
QUEEN ELIZABETH O no my reasons are too deep and
Too deep and dead poor infants in their graves
KING RICHARD Harp not on that string madam that is past
QUEEN ELIZABETH Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings
break
KING RICHARD Now by my George my garter and my
QUEEN ELIZABETH By nothing for this is no oath
If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him
The unity the King my husband made
Thou hadst not broken nor my brothers died
And both the Princes had been breathing here
Which now two tender bedfellows for dust
Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms
What canst thou swear by now
KING RICHARD The time to come
QUEEN ELIZABETH That thou hast wronged in the time
For I myself have many tears to wash
The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed
Old barren plants to wail it with their age
Swear not by time to come for that thou hast
KING RICHARD As I intend to prosper and repent
So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
Of hostile arms Myself myself confound
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
Day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
Be opposite all planets of good luck
Immaculate devotion holy thoughts
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
In her consists my happiness and thine
Without her follows to myself and thee
Herself the land and many a Christian soul
Death desolation ruin and decay
It cannot be avoided but by this
It will not be avoided but by this
Be the attorney of my love to her
Plead what I will be not what I have been
Not my deserts but what I will deserve
Urge the necessity and state of times
QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I be tempted of the devil thus
KING RICHARD Ay if the devil tempt you to do good
QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I forget myself to be myself
yourself
QUEEN ELIZABETH Yet thou didst kill my children
Where in that nest of spicery they will breed
Selves of themselves to your recomforture
QUEEN ELIZABETH Shall I go win my daughter to thy will
KING RICHARD And be a happy mother by the deed
QUEEN ELIZABETH I go Write to me very shortly
And you shall understand from me her mind
Kissing her Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH
Relenting fool and shallow changing woman

DERBY I by attorney bless thee from thy mother
So much for that The silent hours steal on
And flaky darkness breaks within the east
In brief for so the season bids us be
Prepare thy battle early in the morning
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
With best advantage will deceive the time
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms
But on thy side I may not be too forward
Lest being seen thy brother tender George
Farewell the leisure and the fearful time
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
And ample interchange of sweet discourse
God give us leisure for these rites of love
Once more adieu be valiant and speed well
RICHMOND Good lords conduct him to his regiment
When I should mount with wings of victory
Once more good night kind lords and gentlemen
Exeunt all but RICHMOND
O Thou whose captain I account myself
Look on my forces with a gracious eye
Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath
That they may crush down with a heavy fall
The usurping helmets of our adversaries

Find in myself no pity to myself

Hath twice done salutation to the morn
Your friends are up and buckle on their armour
RATCLIFF No doubt my lord
KING RICHARD O Ratcliff I fear I fear
RATCLIFF Nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows
Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond
To see if any mean to shrink from me                 Exeunt
Enter the LORDS to RICHMOND sitting in his tent
LORDS Good morrow Richmond
RICHMOND Cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
LORDS How have you slept my lord
Have I since your departure had my lords
Came to my tent and cried on victory
I promise you my soul is very jocund
In the remembrance of so fair a dream
How far into the morning is it lords
LORDS Upon the stroke of four
His ORATION to his SOLDIERS
More than I have said loving countrymen
The leisure and enforcement of the time
Forbids to dwell upon yet remember this
God and our good cause fight upon our side
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
Richard except those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow
For what is he they follow Truly gentlemen
A bloody tyrant and a homicide
One that made means to come by what he hath
And slaughtered those that were the means to help him
A base foul stone made precious by the foil
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down
You sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
If you do free your children from the sword
Then in the name of God and all these rights
Advance your standards draw your willing swords
For me the ransom of my bold attempt
But if I thrive the gain of my attempt
The least of you shall share his part thereof
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
God and Saint George Richmond and victory           Exeunt
and forces
KING RICHARD What said Northumberland as touching
Richmond
RATCLIFF That he was never trained up in arms
KING RICHARD He said the truth and what said Surrey
then
KING He was in the right and so indeed it is
Tell the clock there Give me a calendar
RATCLIFF Not I my lord
KING RICHARD Then he disdains to shine for by the book
A black day will it be to somebody
Ratcliff
RATCLIFF My lord
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army
I would these dewy tears were from the ground
More than to Richmond For the selfsame heaven
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him
Enter NORFOLK
NORFOLK Arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
KING RICHARD Come bustle bustle caparison my horse
Call up Lord Stanley bid him bring his power
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
And thus my battle shall be ordered
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length
Consisting equally of horse and foot
Our archers shall be placed in the midst
John Duke of Norfolk Thomas Earl of Surrey
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse
They thus directed we will follow
In the main battle whose puissance on either side
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
Norfolk
NORFOLK A good direction warlike sovereign
This found I on my tent this morning
A thing devised by the enemy
Go gentlemen every man unto his charge
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls
Conscience is but a word that cowards use
Our strong arms be our conscience swords our law
If not to heaven then hand in hand to hell
His ORATION to his ARMY
A sort of vagabonds rascals and runaways
A scum of Britaines and base lackey peasants
You sleeping safe they bring to you unrest
They would restrain the one distain the other
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow
Who but for dreaming on this fond exploit
If we be conquered let men conquer us
And not these bastard Britaines whom our fathers
And in record left them the heirs of shame
Shall these enjoy our lands lie with our wives
drum
Fight gentlemen of England Fight bold yeomen
Draw archers draw your arrows to the head
Spur your proud horses hard and ride in blood
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves
Enter a MESSENGER
What says Lord Stanley Will he bring his power
MESSENGER My lord he doth deny to come
After the battle let George Stanley die
KING RICHARD A thousand hearts are great within my
bosom
Advance our standards set upon our foes
Our ancient word of courage fair Saint George
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
Upon them Victory sits on our helms                 Exeunt
SCENE 4
Another part of the field
Alarum excursions Enter NORFOLK and forces to him CATESBY
CATESBY Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue
The King enacts more wonders than a man
Daring an opposite to every danger
His horse is slain and all on foot he fights
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death
Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost
Alarums Enter KING RICHARD
KING RICHARD A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
KING RICHARD Slave I have set my life upon a cast
And I Will stand the hazard of the die
I think there be six Richmonds in the field
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse             Exeunt
SCENE 5
Another part of the field
Alarum Enter RICHARD and RICHMOND they fight RICHARD is slain
Retreat and flourish Enter RICHMOND DERBY bearing the crown
with other LORDS
The day is ours the bloody dog is dead
DERBY Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
Wear it enjoy it and make much of it
RICHMOND Great God of heaven say Amen to all
But teLL me is young George Stanley living
DERBY He is my lord and safe in Leicester town
Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
RICHMOND What men of name are slain on either side
DERBY John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers
Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon
RICHMOND Inter their bodies as becomes their births
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
That in submission will return to us
We will unite the white rose and the red
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
What traitor hears me and says not Amen
All this divided York and Lancaster
Divided in their dire division
O now let Richmond and Elizabeth
The true succeeders of each royal house
And let their heirs God if thy will be so
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord
That would reduce these bloody days again
And make poor England weep in streams of blood
That she may long live here God say Amen            Exeunt

ACT I Scene I
Verona A public place
Greg No for then we should be colliers
Greg Ay while you live draw your neck out of collar
Samp I strike quickly being moved
Greg But thou art not quickly moved to strike
Samp A dog of the house of Montague moves me
Greg To move is to stir and to be valiant is to stand
Samp A dog of that house shall move me to stand I will take the
Greg That shows thee a weak slave for the weakest goes to the
wall
from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall
Greg The quarrel is between our masters and us their men
their heads
Greg The heads of the maids
Samp Ay the heads of the maids or their maidenheads
Take it in what sense thou wilt
Greg They must take it in sense that feel it
am a pretty piece of flesh
Montagues
Samp My naked weapon is out Quarrel I will back thee
Greg How turn thy back and run
Samp Fear me not
Greg No marry I fear thee
Samp Let us take the law of our sides let them begin
Greg I will frown as I pass by and let them take it as they list
Samp Nay as they dare I will bite my thumb at them which is
disgrace to them if they bear it
Abr Do you bite your thumb at us sir
Samp I do bite my thumb sir
Abr Do you bite your thumb at us sir
Samp No sir I do not bite my thumb at you sir but I bite my
thumb sir
Greg Do you quarrel sir
Abr Quarrel sir No sir
Samp But if you do sir am for you I serve as good a man as you
Abr No better
Samp Well sir
Enter Benvolio
Samp Yes better sir
Abr You lie
Samp Draw if you be men Gregory remember thy swashing blow
They fight
Put up your swords You know not what you do
Enter Tybalt
Tyb What art thou drawn among these heartless hinds
Turn thee Benvolio look upon thy death
Ben I do but keep the peace Put up thy sword
Or manage it to part these men with me
Tyb What drawn and talk of peace I hate the word
As I hate hell all Montagues and thee
Have at thee coward                            They fight
Enter an officer and three or four Citizens with clubs or
partisans
Officer Clubs bills and partisans Strike beat them down
Citizens Down with the Capulets Down with the Montagues
Enter Old Capulet in his gown and his Wife
Cap What noise is this Give me my long sword ho
Wife A crutch a crutch Why call you for a sword
Cap My sword I say Old Montague is come
And flourishes his blade in spite of me
Enter Old Montague and his Wife
M Wife Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe
Enter Prince Escalus with his Train
Prince Rebellious subjects enemies to peace
Will they not hear What ho you men you beasts
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins
On pain of torture from those bloody hands
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince
Three civil brawls bred of an airy word
By thee old Capulet and Montague
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
To wield old partisans in hands as old
If ever you disturb our streets again
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
For this time all the rest depart away
You Capulet shall go along with me
And Montague come you this afternoon
To know our farther pleasure in this case
To old Freetown our common judgment place
Once more on pain of death all men depart
Mon Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
Speak nephew were you by when it began
Ben Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours close fighting ere I did approach
I drew to part them In the instant came
He swung about his head and cut the winds
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more and fought on part and part
Till the Prince came who parted either part
Right glad I am he was not at this fray
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
So early walking did I see your son
Towards him I made but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood
Which then most sought where most might not be found
Mon Many a morning hath he there been seen
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
Should in the farthest East bean to draw
Away from light steals home my heavy son
And private in his chamber pens himself
Shuts up his windows locks fair daylight
And makes himself an artificial night
Black and portentous must this humour prove
Unless good counsel may the cause remove
Ben My noble uncle do you know the cause
Mon I neither know it nor can learn of him
Mon Both by myself and many other friend
But to himself so secret and so close
So far from sounding and discovery
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
We would as willingly give cure as know
Enter Romeo
Ben See where he comes So please you step aside
Mon I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
Ben Good morrow cousin
Rom Is the day so young
Ben But new struck nine
Rom Ay me sad hours seem long
Was that my father that went hence so fast
Rom Not having that which having makes them short
Ben In love
Ben Of love
Rom Out of her favour where I am in love
Ben Alas that love so gentle in his view
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
Rom Alas that love whose view is muffled still
Should without eyes see pathways to his will
Where shall we dine O me What fray was here
Yet tell me not for I have heard it all
Why then O brawling love O loving hate
O anything of nothing first create
O heavy lightness serious vanity
Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health
This love feel I that feel no love in this
Dost thou not laugh
Ben No coz I rather weep
Rom Good heart at what
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own
What is it else A madness most discreet
A choking gall and a preserving sweet
Farewell my coz
Ben Soft I will go along
An if you leave me so you do me wrong
Rom Tut I have lost myself I am not here
Ben Tell me in sadness who is that you love
Rom What shall I groan and tell thee
Ben Groan Why no
But sadly tell me who
Rom Bid a sick man in sadness make his will
In sadness cousin I do love a woman
Ben A right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
That when she dies with beauty dies her store
Ben Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
Rom She hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
Cuts beauty off from all posterity
She is too fair too wise wisely too fair
To merit bliss by making me despair
She hath forsworn to love and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now
Rom O teach me how I should forget to think
Ben By giving liberty unto thine eyes
Examine other beauties
Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost
Show me a mistress that is passing fair
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Farewell Thou canst not teach me to forget
Scene II
A Street
Cap But Montague is bound as well as I
For men so old as we to keep the peace
Par Of honourable reckoning are you both
But now my lord what say you to my suit
My child is yet a stranger in the world
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
Par Younger than she are happy mothers made
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she
She is the hopeful lady of my earth
But woo her gentle Paris get her heart
My will to her consent is but a part
An she agree within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice
Whereto I have invited many a guest
Such as I love and you among the store
One more most welcome makes my number more
At my poor house look to behold this night
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
Of limping Winter treads even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house Hear all all see
And like her most whose merit most shall be
Which on more view of many mine being one
trudge about
Through fair Verona find those persons out
Whose names are written there and to them say
Serv Find them out whose names are written here It is written
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
with his last the fisher with his pencil and the painter with
his nets but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
here writ and can never find what names the writing person hath
here writ I must to the learned In good time
Enter Benvolio and Romeo
Turn giddy and be holp by backward turning
Take thou some new infection to thy eye
And the rank poison of the old will die
Rom Your plantain leaf is excellent for that
Ben For what I pray thee
Rom For your broken shin
Ben Why Romeo art thou mad
Rom Not mad but bound more than a madman is
Shut up in Prison kept without my food
Rom Ay mine own fortune in my misery
Serv Perhaps you have learned it without book But I pray can you
read anything you see
Rom Ay If I know the letters and the language
Serv Ye say honestly Rest you merry
Rom Stay fellow I can read                       He reads
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters
The lady widow of Vitruvio
Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces
Mercutio and his brother Valentine
Mine uncle Capulet his wife and daughters
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia
Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt
Serv Up
Rom Whither
Serv To supper to our house
Rom Whose house
Capulet and if you be not of the house of Montagues I pray come
and crush a cup of wine Rest you merry               Exit
With all the admired beauties of Verona
Go thither and with unattainted eye
Compare her face with some that I shall show
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow
Rom When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires
Transparent heretics be burnt for liars
Ben Tut you saw her fair none else being by
That I will show you shining at this feast
And she shall scant show well that now seems best
Scene III
Nurse Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old
I bade her come What lamb what ladybird
Enter Juliet
Jul How now Who calls
Nurse Your mother
Jul Madam I am here
What is your will
We must talk in secret Nurse come back again
Nurse Faith I can tell her age unto an hour
She is not fourteen How long is it now
To Lammastide
Wife A fortnight and odd days
Nurse Even or odd of all days in the year
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
Were of an age Well Susan is with God
She was too good for me But as I said
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen
That shall she marry I remember it well
Of all the days of the year upon that day
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
My lord and you were then at Mantua
Nay I do bear a brain But as I said
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
To bid me trudge
And since that time it is eleven years
She could have run and waddled all about
For even the day before she broke her brow
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit
To see now how a jest shall come about
I warrant an I should live a thousand yeas
Wife Enough of this I pray thee hold thy peace
Nurse Yes madam Yet I cannot choose but laugh
And yet I warrant it bad upon it brow
A perilous knock and it cried bitterly
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age
Jul And stint thou too I pray thee nurse say I
Nurse Peace I have done God mark thee to his grace
An I might live to see thee married once I have my wish
I came to talk of Tell me daughter Juliet
How stands your disposition to be married
Jul It is an honour that I dream not of
Nurse An honour Were not I thine only nurse
Wife Well think of marriage now Younger than you
Here in Verona ladies of esteem
Are made already mothers By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid Thus then in brief
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love
Nurse A man young lady lady such a man
Wife What say you Can you love the gentleman
This night you shall behold him at our feast
Examine every married lineament
And see how one another lends content
Find written in the margent of his eyes
This precious book of love this unbound lover
To beautify him only lacks a cover
For fair without the fair within to hide
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story
So shall you share all that he doth possess
By having him making yourself no less
Nurse No less Nay bigger Women grow by men
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly
Enter Servingman
everything in extremity I must hence to wait I beseech you
follow straight
Juliet the County stays
Nurse Go girl seek happy nights to happy days
Exeunt
Scene IV
A street
Enter Romeo Mercutio Benvolio with five or six other Maskers Torchbearers
Rom What shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
Or shall we on without apology
Ben The date is out of such prolixity
Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
After the prompter for our entrance
But let them measure us by what they will
Rom Give me a torch I am not for this ambling
Being but heavy I will bear the light
Mer Nay gentle Romeo we must have you dance
Rom Not I believe me You have dancing shoes
With nimble soles I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move
And soar with them above a common bound
Rom I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers and so bound
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
Too great oppression for a tender thing
Rom Is love a tender thing It is too rough
Mer If love be rough with you be rough with love
Prick love for pricking and you beat love down
Give me a case to put my visage in
A visor for a visor What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
Ben Come knock and enter and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs
Rom A torch for me Let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
Up to the ears Come we burn daylight ho
Mer I mean sir in delay
We waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
Take our good meaning for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits
Rom And we mean well in going to this masque
Mer Why may one ask
Mer And so did I
Rom Well what was yours
Mer That dreamers often lie
Rom In bed asleep while they do dream things true
Mer O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you
In shape no bigger than an agate stone
On the forefinger of an alderman
Drawn with a team of little atomies
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers
Not half so big as a round little worm
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit
Then dreams he of another benefice
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
Of breaches ambuscadoes Spanish blades
Of healths five fadom deep and then anon
Drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
This is the hag when maids lie on their backs
That presses them and learns them first to bear
Making them women of good carriage
Rom Peace peace Mercutio peace
Mer True I talk of dreams
Which are the children of an idle brain
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the North
Ben This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
Supper is done and we shall come too late
Rom I fear too early for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
By some vile forfeit of untimely death
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my sail On lusty gentlemen
Ben Strike drum
Scene V
Servingmen come forth with napkins
He shift a trencher he scrape a trencher
to the plate Good thou save me a piece of marchpane and as
thou loves me let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell
Anthony and Potpan
2 Serv Ay boy ready
for in the great chamber
3 Serv We cannot be here and there too Cheerly boys
Be brisk awhile and the longer liver take all      Exeunt
Juliet Tybalt and all the Guests
and Gentlewomen to the Maskers
Cap Welcome gentlemen Ladies that have their toes
Ah ha my mistresses which of you all
Will now deny to dance She that makes dainty
Welcome gentlemen I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
You are welcome gentlemen Come musicians play
A hall a hall give room and foot it girls
Music plays and they dance
More light you knaves and turn the tables up
And quench the fire the room is grown too hot
Nay sit nay sit good cousin Capulet
For you and I are past our dancing days
Were in a mask
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will
His son is thirty
Cap Will you tell me that
His son was but a ward two years ago
Of yonder knight
Serv I know not sir
Rom O she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
And touching hers make blessed my rude hand
Did my heart love till now Forswear it sight
Tyb This by his voice should be a Montague
Fetch me my rapier boy What dares the slave
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity
Now by the stock and honour of my kin
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin
Cap Why how now kinsman Wherefore storm you so
Tyb Uncle this is a Montague our foe
A villain that is hither come in spite
To scorn at our solemnity this night
Cap Young Romeo is it
Cap Content thee gentle coz let him alone
And to say truth Verona brags of him
I would not for the wealth of all this town
Here in my house do him disparagement
Therefore be patient take no note of him
It is my will the which if thou respect
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns
Tyb It fits when such a villain is a guest
What goodman boy I say he shall Go to
Am I the master here or you Go to
Cap Go to go to
This trick may chance to scathe you I know what
Tyb Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
I will withdraw but this intrusion shall
Rom If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine the gentle fine is this
My lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss
Jul Good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
Which mannerly devotion shows in this
Rom Have not saints lips and holy palmers too
Rom O then dear saint let lips do what hands do
They pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
Jul Then have my lips the sin that they have took
Nurse Madam your mother craves a word with you
Rom What is her mother
Nurse Marry bachelor
Her mother is the lady of the house
And a good lady and a wise and virtuous
I tell you he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks
Rom Is she a Capulet
Ben Away be gone the sport is at the best
Rom Ay so I fear the more is my unrest
Cap Nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards
I thank you honest gentlemen Good night
Ah sirrah by my fay it waxes late
Jul Come hither nurse What is yond gentleman
Nurse The son and heir of old Tiberio
Nurse Marry that I think be young Petruchio
Nurse I know not
My grave is like to be my wedding bed
Nurse His name is Romeo and a Montague
The only son of your great enemy
Jul My only love sprung from my only hate
Too early seen unknown and known too late
Prodigious birth of love it is to me
That I must love a loathed enemy
Jul A rhyme I learnt even now
Nurse Anon anon

PROLOGUE
Enter Chorus
Chor Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
And young affection gapes to be his heir
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks
Being held a foe he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
And she as much in love her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere
But passion lends them power time means to meet
Exit
ACT II Scene I
Enter Romeo alone
Rom Can I go forward when my heart is here
Turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
Enter Benvolio with Mercutio
Ben Romeo my cousin Romeo Romeo
Mer He is wise
Ben He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall
Call good Mercutio
Romeo humours madman passion lover
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
Speak but one rhyme and I am satisfied
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word
One nickname for her purblind son and heir
Young Adam Cupid he that shot so trim
He heareth not he stirreth not be moveth not
The ape is dead and I must conjure him
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip
By her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie
That in thy likeness thou appear to us
Ben An if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
Of some strange nature letting it there stand
That were some spite my invocation
I conjure only but to raise up him
Ben Come he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night
Blind is his love and best befits the dark
Mer If love be blind love cannot hit the mark
Now will he sit under a medlar tree
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone
O Romeo that she were O that she were
Come shall we go
Exeunt
Scene II
Enter Romeo
Rom He jests at scars that never felt a wound
Enter Juliet above at a window
But soft What light through yonder window breaks
It is the East and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief
That thou her maid art far more fair than she
Be not her maid since she is envious
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it Cast it off
It is my lady O it is my love
O that she knew she were
She speaks yet she says nothing What of that
Her eye discourses I will answer it
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
Having some business do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return
What if her eyes were there they in her head
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
As daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand
O that I were a glove upon that hand
That I might touch that cheek
Jul Ay me
Rom She speaks
O speak again bright angel for thou art
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
And sails upon the bosom of the air
Jul O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny thy father and refuse thy name
Or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
Thou art thyself though not a Montague
Nor arm nor face nor any other part
Belonging to a man O be some other name
By any other name would smell as sweet
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title Romeo doff thy name
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself
Rom I take thee at thy word
Henceforth I never will be Romeo
So stumblest on my counsel
Rom By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am
My name dear saint is hateful to myself
Because it is an enemy to thee
Had I it written I would tear the word
Jul My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague
Rom Neither fair saint if either thee dislike
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
And the place death considering who thou art
If any of my kinsmen find thee here
For stony limits cannot hold love out
And what love can do that dares love attempt
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
Jul If they do see thee they will murther thee
Rom Alack there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords Look thou but sweet
And I am proof against their enmity
Jul I would not for the world they saw thee here
And but thou love me let them find me here
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued wanting of thy love
Rom By love that first did prompt me to enquire
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes
I am no pilot yet wert thou as far
I would adventure for such merchandise
Jul Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
What I have spoke but farewell compliment
They say Jove laughs O gentle Romeo
If thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won
So thou wilt woo but else not for the world
In truth fair Montague I am too fond
And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light
Than those that have more cunning to be strange
I should have been more strange I must confess
And not impute this yielding to light love
Which the dark night hath so discovered
Rom Lady by yonder blessed moon I swear
That monthly changes in her circled orb
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable
Rom What shall I swear by
Jul Do not swear at all
Or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
Which is the god of my idolatry
Jul Well do not swear Although I joy in thee
Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
Good night good night As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast
Rom O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
Jul I gave thee mine before thou didst request it
And yet I would it were to give again
Jul But to be frank and give it thee again
And yet I wish but for the thing I have
My bounty is as boundless as the sea
My love as deep the more I give to thee
The more I have for both are infinite
I hear some noise within Dear love adieu
Anon good nurse Sweet Montague be true
Rom O blessed blessed night I am afeard
Being in night all this is but a dream
Enter Juliet above
Jul Three words dear Romeo and good night indeed
If that thy bent of love be honourable
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
And follow thee my lord throughout the world
To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief
Jul A thousand times good night                        Exit
Rom A thousand times the worse to want thy light
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books
But love from love towards school with heavy looks
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
Romeo
Rom It is my soul that calls upon my name
Like softest music to attending ears
Jul Romeo
Rom My dear
Shall I send to thee
Rom By the hour of nine
I have forgot why I did call thee back
Rom Let me stand here till thou remember it
Jul I shall forget to have thee still stand there
Forgetting any other home but this
That lets it hop a little from her hand
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
And with a silk thread plucks it back again
Rom I would I were thy bird
Jul Sweet so would I
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing
Good night good night Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow
Rom Sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
Would I were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell
Exit
Scene III
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
Non ere the sun advance his burning eye
What is her burying gave that is her womb
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find
Many for many virtues excellent
None but for some and yet all different
O mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants herbs stones and their true qualities
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give
Revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power
For this being smelt with that part cheers each part
Being tasted slays all senses with the heart
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
And where the worser is predominant
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant
Enter Romeo
Rom Good morrow father
Friar Benedicite
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me
Young son it argues a distempered head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
And where care lodges sleep will never lie
Doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Friar God pardon sin Wast thou with Rosaline
Rom With Rosaline my ghostly father No
I have been feasting with mine enemy
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Within thy help and holy physic lies
I bear no hatred blessed man for lo
My intercession likewise steads my foe
Friar Be plain good son and homely in thy drift
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet
As mine on hers so hers is set on mine
By holy marriage When and where and how
Friar Holy Saint Francis What a change is here
Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear
Not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
Jesu Maria What a deal of brine
How much salt water thrown away in waste
To season love that of it doth not taste
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline
Friar For doting not for loving pupil mine
Friar Not in a grave
To lay one in another out to have
Rom I pray thee chide not She whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow
The other did not so
Friar O she knew well
Thy love did read by rote that could not spell
But come young waverer come go with me
For this alliance may so happy prove
Rom O let us hence I stand on sudden haste
Friar Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast
Exeunt
Scene IV
A street
Enter Benvolio and Mercutio
Mer Where the devil should this Romeo be
Torments him so that he will sure run mad
Ben Tybalt the kinsman to old Capulet
Mer A challenge on my life
Ben Romeo will answer it
Mer Any man that can write may answer a letter
dared
and is he a man to encounter Tybalt
Ben Why what is Tybalt
courageous captain of compliments He fights as you sing
minim rest one two and the third in your bosom the very
butcher of a silk button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of
the very first house of the first and second cause Ah the
immortal passado the punto reverse the hay
Ben The what
grandsir that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
bench O their bones their bones
Enter Romeo
Ben Here comes Romeo here comes Romeo
Mer Without his roe like a dried herring O flesh flesh how art
thou fishified Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots This be a gray eye or so
salutation to your French slop You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night
Rom Good morrow to you both What counterfeit did I give you
Mer The slip sir the slip Can you not conceive
Rom Pardon good Mercutio My business was great and in such a
case as mine a man may strain courtesy
man to bow in the hams
Rom Meaning to cursy
Mer Thou hast most kindly hit it
Rom A most courteous exposition
Mer Nay I am the very pink of courtesy
Rom Pink for flower
Mer Right
Mer Well said Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy
pump that when the single sole of it is worn the jest may
remain after the wearing solely singular
Mer Come between us good Benvolio My wits faint
hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I
have in my whole five Was I with you there for the goose
Rom Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there
for the goose
Mer I will bite thee by the ear for that jest
Rom Nay good goose bite not
Mer Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most sharp sauce
narrow to an ell broad
goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
Mer Why is not this better now than groaning for love Now art
thou sociable now art thou Romeo now art thou what thou art by
art as well as by nature For this drivelling love is like a
great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
a hole
Ben Stop there stop there
Mer Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
Ben Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
come to the whole depth of my tale and meant indeed to occupy
the argument no longer
Mer A sail a sail
Ben Two two a shirt and a smock
Nurse Peter
Peter Anon
Nurse My fan Peter

Nurse God ye good morrow gentlemen
upon the prick of noon
Nurse Out upon you What a man are you
Rom One gentlewoman that God hath made for himself to mar
Romeo
Rom I can tell you but young Romeo will be older when you have
found him than he was when you sought him I am the youngest of
that name for fault of a worse
Nurse You say well
wisely
Nurse If you be he sir I desire some confidence with you
Ben She will endite him to some supper
Mer A bawd a bawd a bawd So ho
Rom What hast thou found
Mer No hare sir unless a hare sir in a lenten pie that is
something stale and hoar ere it be spent
He walks by them and sings
An old hare hoar
And an old hare hoar
Is very good meat in Lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score
When it hoars ere it be spent
Rom I will follow you
Mer Farewell ancient lady Farewell
Exeunt Mercutio Benvolio
Nurse Marry farewell I Pray you Sir what saucy merchant was
this that was so full of his ropery
Rom A gentleman nurse that loves to hear himself talk and will
speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month
were lustier than he is and twenty such jacks and if I cannot
by too and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure
Peter I saw no man use you at his pleasure If I had my weapon
should quickly have been out I warrant you I dare draw as soon
as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law
on my side
Nurse Now afore God I am so vexed that every part about me
quivers Scurvy knave Pray you sir a word and as I told you
my young lady bid me enquire you out What she bid me say I will
keep to myself but first let me tell ye if ye should lead her
behaviour as they say for the gentlewoman is young and
therefore if you should deal double with her truly it were an
Rom Nurse commend me to thy lady and mistress I protest unto
Nurse Good heart and I faith I will tell her as much Lord
Lord she will be a joyful woman
Rom What wilt thou tell her nurse Thou dost not mark me
Nurse I will tell her sir that you do protest which as I take
it is a gentlemanlike offer
Rom Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon
Nurse No truly sir not a penny
Rom Go to I say you shall
Nurse This afternoon sir Well she shall be there
Rom And stay good nurse behind the abbey wall
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night
Farewell Commend me to thy mistress
Nurse Now God in heaven bless thee Hark you sir
Two may keep counsel putting one away
Nurse Well sir my mistress is the sweetest lady Lord Lord
town one Paris that would fain lay knife aboard but she good
soul had as lieve see a toad a very toad as see him I anger
her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man but
in the versal world Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both with
a letter
Rom Ay nurse what of that Both with an R
it begins with some other letter and she hath the prettiest
sententious of it of you and rosemary that it would do you good
to hear it
Rom Commend me to thy lady
Peter Anon
Nurse Peter take my fan and go before and apace
Exeunt
Scene V
Enter Juliet
Jul The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Is three long hours yet she is not come
Had she affections and warm youthful blood
She would be as swift in motion as a ball
My words would bandy her to my sweet love
And his to me
Unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
O God she comes O honey nurse what news
Hast thou met with him Send thy man away
Nurse Peter stay at the gate
Though news be sad yet tell them merrily
If good thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face
Nurse I am aweary give me leave awhile
Fie how my bones ache What a jaunce have I had
Jul I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news
Nay come I pray thee speak Good good nurse speak
Nurse Jesu what haste Can you not stay awhile
Do you not see that I am out of breath
Jul How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
Is thy news good or bad Answer to that
Nurse Well you have made a simple choice you know not how to
choose a man Romeo No not he Though his face be better than
warrant him as gentle as a lamb Go thy ways wench serve God
Jul No no But all this did I know before
What says he of our marriage What of that
Nurse Lord how my head aches What a head have I
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down
Sweet sweet Sweet nurse tell me what says my love
Nurse Your love says like an honest gentleman and a courteous
your mother
Jul Where is my mother Why she is within
Where should she be How oddly thou repliest
Are you so hot Marry come up I trow
Is this the poultice for my aching bones
Henceforward do your messages yourself
Jul I have
There stays a husband to make you a wife
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
Hie you to church I must another way
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
I am the drudge and toil in your delight
But you shall bear the burthen soon at night
Jul Hie to high fortune Honest nurse farewell
Exeunt
Scene VI
Friar So smile the heavens upon this holy act
Rom Amen amen But come what sorrow can
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight
Do thou but close our hands with holy words
It is enough I may but call her mine
Friar These violent delights have violent ends
And in their triumph die like fire and powder
Which as they kiss consume The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
And in the taste confounds the appetite
Therefore love moderately long love doth so
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
Enter Juliet
Here comes the lady O so light a foot
A lover may bestride the gossamer
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall so light is vanity
Jul Good even to my ghostly confessor
Friar Romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
Jul As much to him else is his thanks too much
Rom Ah Juliet if the measure of thy joy
To blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
Receive in either by this dear encounter
Jul Conceit more rich in matter than in words
Brags of his substance not of ornament
They are but beggars that can count their worth
But my true love is grown to such excess
cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
Friar Come come with me and we will make short work
For by your leaves you shall not stay alone
Till Holy Church incorporate two in one

ACT III Scene I
A public place
Enter Mercutio Benvolio and Men
The day is hot the Capulets abroad
And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
For now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
Mer Thou art like one of these fellows that when he enters the
confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says
cup draws him on the drawer when indeed there is no need
Ben Am I like such a fellow
Mer Come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
Italy and as soon moved to be moody and as soon moody to be
moved
Ben And what to
Mer Nay an there were two such we should have none shortly for
one would kill the other Thou why thou wilt quarrel with a man
that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no other
reason but because thou hast hazel eyes What eye but such an eye
would spy out such a quarrel Thy head is as full of quarrels as
an egg is full of meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as
for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that
hath lain asleep in the sun Didst thou not fall out with a
tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter with another
for tying his new shoes with an old riband And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling
Ben An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man should buy
the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter
Mer The fee simple O simple
Enter Tybalt and others
Ben By my head here come the Capulets
Mer By my heel I care not
Tyb Follow me close for I will speak to them
Gentlemen good den A word with one of you
Mer And but one word with one of us
Couple it with something make it a word and a blow
Tyb You shall find me apt enough to that sir an you will give me
occasion
Mer Could you not take some occasion without giving
Tyb Mercutio thou consortest with Romeo
Mer Consort What dost thou make us minstrels An thou make
Ben We talk here in the public haunt of men
Either withdraw unto some private place
And reason coldly of your grievances
Or else depart Here all eyes gaze on us
Enter Romeo
Tyb Well peace be with you sir Here comes my man
Your worship in that sense may call him man
Tyb Romeo the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this thou art a villain
Rom Tybalt the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting Villain am I none
Therefore farewell I see thou knowest me not
Tyb Boy this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love
And so good Capulet which name I tender
As dearly as mine own be satisfied
Mer O calm dishonourable vile submission
Tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
Tyb What wouldst thou have with me
Mer Good King of Cats nothing but one of your nine lives That I
mean to make bold withal and as you shall use me hereafter
his pitcher by the ears Make haste lest mine be about your ears
ere it be out
Rom Gentle Mercutio put thy rapier up
Mer Come sir your passado
Rom Draw Benvolio beat down their weapons
Gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage
Tybalt Mercutio the Prince expressly hath
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets
Hold Tybalt Good Mercutio
Mer I am hurt
Is he gone and hath nothing
Ben What art thou hurt
Where is my page Go villain fetch a surgeon
Rom Courage man The hurt cannot be much
shall find me a grave man I am peppered I warrant for this
mouse a cat to scratch a man to death a braggart a rogue a
villain that fights by the book of arithmetic Why the devil
came you between us I was hurt under your arm
Rom I thought all for the best
Mer Help me into some house Benvolio
And soundly too Your houses
My very friend hath got this mortal hurt
Hath been my kinsman O sweet Juliet
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
Enter Benvolio
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth
This but begins the woe others must end
Enter Tybalt
Ben Here comes the furious Tybalt back again
Rom Alive in triumph and Mercutio slain
Away to heaven respective lenity
Is but a little way above our heads
Staying for thine to keep him company
Either thou or I or both must go with him
Tyb Thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
Shalt with him hence
Rom This shall determine that
They fight Tybalt falls
Ben Romeo away be gone
The citizens are up and Tybalt slain
If thou art taken Hence be gone away
Ben Why dost thou stay
Exit Romeo
Enter Citizens
Tybalt that murtherer which way ran he
Ben There lies that Tybalt
Citizen Up sir go with me
Prince Where are the vile beginners of this fray
Ben O noble Prince I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl
There lies the man slain by young Romeo
That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio
Of my dear kinsman Prince as thou art true
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague
O cousin cousin
Prince Benvolio who began this bloody fray
Romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
Who all as hot turns deadly point to point
And with a martial scorn with one hand beats
Cold death aside and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt whose dexterity
Retorts it Romeo he cries aloud
His agile arm beats down their fatal points
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio and then Tybalt fled
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly
This is the truth or let Benvolio die
Cap Wife He is a kinsman to the Montague
Affection makes him false he speaks not true
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife
And all those twenty could but kill one life
I beg for justice which thou Prince must give
Romeo slew Tybalt Romeo must not live
Prince Romeo slew him he slew Mercutio
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
His fault concludes but what the law should end
The life of Tybalt
Prince And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence
That you shall all repent the loss of mine
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
Therefore use none Let Romeo hence in haste
Else when he is found that hour is his last
Bear hence this body and attend our will
Mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
Exeunt
Scene II
Enter Juliet alone
As Phaeton would whip you to the West
And bring in cloudy night immediately
That runaway eyes may wink and Romeo
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties or if love be blind
It best agrees with night Come civil night
And learn me how to lose a winning match
With thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
Think true love acted simple modesty
Come night come Romeo come thou day in night
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Give me my Romeo and when he shall die
Take him and cut him out in little stars
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun
O I have bought the mansion of a love
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them O here comes my nurse
Enter Nurse with cords
And she brings news and every tongue that speaks
Now nurse what news What hast thou there the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch
Nurse Ay ay the cords
Jul Ay me what news Why dost thou wring thy hands
We are undone lady we are undone
Jul Can heaven be so envious
Nurse Romeo can
Though heaven cannot O Romeo Romeo
Who ever would have thought it Romeo
Jul What devil art thou that dost torment me thus
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
Nurse I saw the wound I saw it with mine eyes
A piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
Jul O break my heart poor bankrout break at once
Vile earth to earth resign end motion here
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier
Nurse O Tybalt Tybalt the best friend I had
O courteous Tybalt honest gentleman
That ever I should live to see thee dead
Jul What storm is this that blows so contrary
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
For who is living if those two are gone
Nurse Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished
Nurse It did it did alas the day it did
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
Beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
Despised substance of divinest show
A damned saint an honourable villain
O nature what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace
All forsworn all naught all dissemblers
These griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
Shame come to Romeo
For such a wish He was not born to shame
Sole monarch of the universal earth
O what a beast was I to chide at him
Jul Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband
Ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
But wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
Back foolish tears back to your native spring
Your tributary drops belong to woe
Which you mistaking offer up to joy
My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain
All this is comfort wherefore weep I then
But O it presses to my memory
Was woe enough if it had ended there
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship
Thy father or thy mother nay or both
Is father mother Tybalt Romeo Juliet
There is no end no limit measure bound
Where is my father and my mother nurse
Will you go to them I will bring you thither
Jul Wash they his wounds with tears Mine shall be spent
He made you for a highway to my bed
And death not Romeo take my maidenhead
To comfort you I wot well where he is
Hark ye your Romeo will be here at night
Jul O find him give this ring to my true knight
And bid him come to take his last farewell
Exeunt
Scene III
Friar Romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man
And thou art wedded to calamity
Enter Romeo
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
That I yet know not
Friar Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company
For exile hath more terror in his look
Friar Hence from Verona art thou banished
Be patient for the world is broad and wide
Rom There is no world without Verona walls
But purgatory torture hell itself
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me
Friar O deadly sin O rude unthankfulness
Thy fault our law calls death but the kind Prince
This is dear mercy and thou seest it not
Where Juliet lives and every cat and dog
And little mouse every unworthy thing
Live here in heaven and may look on her
But Romeo may not More validity
More honourable state more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo They may seize
And steal immortal blessing from her lips
Who even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
This may flies do when I from this must fly
They are free men but I am banished
And sayest thou yet that exile is not death
O friar the damned use that word in hell
Howling attends it How hast thou the heart
Being a divine a ghostly confessor
Friar Thou fond mad man hear me a little speak
Rom O thou wilt speak again of banishment
To comfort thee though thou art banished
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet
It helps not it prevails not Talk no more
Friar O then I see that madmen have no ears
Rom How should they when that wise men have no eyes
Friar Let me dispute with thee of thy estate
Rom Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel
Wert thou as young as I Juliet thy love
An hour but married Tybalt murdered
Doting like me and like me banished
Then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
And fall upon the ground as I do now
Taking the measure of an unmade grave
Friar Arise one knocks Good Romeo hide thyself
Rom Not I unless the breath of heartsick groans
I come from Lady Juliet
Friar Welcome then
Enter Nurse
Nurse O holy friar O tell me holy friar
Friar There on the ground with his own tears made drunk
Just in her case
Friar O woeful sympathy
Piteous predicament
Nurse Even so lies she
Stand up stand up Stand an you be a man
Why should you fall into so deep an O
Rom Spakest thou of Juliet How is it with her
Doth not she think me an old murtherer
Where is she and how doth she and what says
Nurse O she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
And now falls on her bed and then starts up
And Tybalt calls and then on Romeo cries
And then down falls again
Rom As if that name
Shot from the deadly level of a gun
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge Tell me that I may sack
Friar Hold thy desperate hand
Art thou a man Thy form cries out thou art
Thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast
Unseemly woman in a seeming man
Hast thou slain Tybalt Wilt thou slay thyself
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives
By doing damned hate upon thyself
Why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
In thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
Fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
Digressing from the valour of a man
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
Thy wit that ornament to shape and love
Misshapen in the conduct of them both
is get afire by thine own ignorance
What rouse thee man Thy Juliet is alive
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
There art thou happy Tybalt would kill thee
But thou slewest Tybalt There art thou happy too
And turns it to exile There art thou happy
A pack of blessings light upon thy back
Happiness courts thee in her best array
Take heed take heed for such die miserable
Go get thee to thy love as was decreed
Ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
But look thou stay not till the watch be set
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
Beg pardon of the Prince and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Go before nurse Commend me to thy lady
And bid her hasten all the house to bed
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
Romeo is coming
To hear good counsel O what learning is
Rom Do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
Nurse Here is a ring she bid me give you sir
Hie you make haste for it grows very late           Exit
Friar Go hence good night and here stands all your state
Either be gone before the watch be set
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here
Rom But that a joy past joy calls out on me
It were a grief so brief to part with thee
Farewell
Exeunt
Scene IV
Enter Old Capulet his Wife and Paris
That we have had no time to move our daughter
And so did I Well we were born to die
I promise you but for your company

Par These times of woe afford no tune to woo
Madam good night Commend me to your daughter
Cap Sir Paris I will make a desperate tender
In all respects by me nay more I doubt it not
Wife go you to her ere you go to bed
But soft what day is this
Par Monday my lord
Cap Monday ha ha Well Wednesday is too soon
She shall be married to this noble earl

It may be thought we held him carelessly
Being our kinsman if we revel much
And there an end But what say you to Thursday
Cap Well get you gone A Thursday be it then
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed
Prepare her wife against this wedding day
Afore me It is so very very late
Good night
Exeunt
Scene V
Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft at the Window
Jul Wilt thou be gone It is not yet near day
It was the nightingale and not the lark
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree
Believe me love it was the nightingale
Rom It was the lark the herald of the morn
No nightingale Look love what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
I must be gone and live or stay and die
Jul Yond light is not daylight I know it I
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on the way to Mantua
I am content so thou wilt have it so
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads
I have more care to stay than will to go
Come death and welcome Juliet wills it so
Jul It is it is Hie hence be gone away
It is the lark that sings so out of tune
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
Some say the lark makes sweet division
This doth not so for she divideth us
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
O now be gone More light and light it grows
Enter Nurse
Nurse Madam
Jul Nurse
Nurse Your lady mother is coming to your chamber
The day is broke be wary look about
Jul Then window let day in and let life out
He goeth down
Jul Art thou gone so my lord my love my friend
I must hear from thee every day in the hour
For in a minute there are many days
O by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo
Rom Farewell
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings love to thee
Rom I doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come
Methinks I see thee now thou art below
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb
Rom And trust me love in my eye so do you
Dry sorrow drinks our blood Adieu adieu
Exit
Jul O Fortune Fortune all men call thee fickle
If thou art fickle what dost thou with him
For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back
Is she not down so late or up so early
Enter Mother
Lady Why how now Juliet
Jul Madam I am not well
What wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
An if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
Therefore have done Some grief shows much of love
But much of grief shows still some want of wit
Jul Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
Lady So shall you feel the loss but not the friend
Which you weep for
Jul Feeling so the loss
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend
Jul What villain madam
Lady That same villain Romeo
God pardon him I do with all my heart
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart
Lady That is because the traitor murderer lives
Jul Ay madam from the reach of these my hands
Lady We will have vengeance for it fear thou not
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied
Jul Indeed I never shall be satisfied
Madam if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison I would temper it
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof
Soon sleep in quiet O how my heart abhors
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
Jul And joy comes well in such a needy time
What are they I beseech your ladyship
Lady Well well thou hast a careful father child
One who to put thee from thy heaviness
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
Jul Madam in happy time What day is that
Lady Marry my child early next Thursday morn
The gallant young and noble gentleman
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
He shall not make me there a joyful bride
I wonder at this haste that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo
I pray you tell my lord and father madam
I will not marry yet and when I do I swear
It shall be Romeo whom you know I hate
Rather than Paris These are news indeed
Lady Here comes your father Tell him so yourself
And see how be will take it at your hands
Enter Capulet and Nurse
Cap When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
It rains downright
How now a conduit girl What still in tears
For still thy eyes which I may call the sea
Do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
Sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
Who raging with thy tears and they with them
Without a sudden calm will overset
Have you delivered to her our decree
Lady Ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
I would the fool were married to her grave
Cap Soft take me with you take me with you wife
How Will she none Doth she not give us thanks
Is she not proud Doth she not count her blest
Unworthy as she is that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
Jul Not proud you have but thankful that you have
Proud can I never be of what I hate
But thankful even for hate that is meant love
Cap How how how how choplogic What is this
Thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither
Lady Fie fie what are you mad
Jul Good father I beseech you on my knees
Hear me with patience but to speak a word
Cap Hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
Or never after look me in the face
Speak not reply not do not answer me
My fingers itch Wife we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child
But now I see this one is one too much
And that we have a curse in having her
Out on her hilding
Nurse God in heaven bless her
You are to blame my lord to rate her so
Cap And why my Lady Wisdom Hold your tongue
Good Prudence Smatter with your gossips go
Nurse I speak no treason
Nurse May not one speak
Cap Peace you mumbling fool
For here we need it not
Lady You are too hot
At home abroad alone in company
Waking or sleeping still my care hath been
A gentleman of princely parentage
And then to have a wretched puling fool
Graze where you will you shall not house with me
Thursday is near lay hand on heart advise
An you be not hang beg starve die in the streets
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good
Jul Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
That sees into the bottom of my grief
O sweet my mother cast me not away
Delay this marriage for a month a week
Or if you do not make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies
Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee            Exit
My husband is on earth my faith in heaven
How shall that faith return again to earth
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth Comfort me counsel me
Alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself
Some comfort nurse
Nurse Faith here it is
Or if he do it needs must be by stealth
Then since the case so stands as now it doth
I think it best you married with the County
Hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
As Paris hath Beshrew my very heart
I think you are happy in this second match
For it excels your first or if it did not
As living here and you no use of him
Nurse And from my soul too else beshrew them both
Jul Amen
Nurse What
Jul Well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
Go in and tell my lady I am gone
Nurse Marry I will and this is wisely done           Exit
Jul Ancient damnation O most wicked fiend
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
So many thousand times Go counsellor
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
If all else fail myself have power to die            Exit

ACT IV Scene I
Friar On Thursday sir The time is very short
Par My father Capulet will have it so
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste
Uneven is the course I like it not
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears
Now sir her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
To stop the inundation of her tears
Which too much minded by herself alone
May be put from her by society
Now do you know the reason of this haste
Look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
Enter Juliet
Par Happily met my lady and my wife
Jul That may be sir when I may be a wife
Par That may be must be love on Thursday next
Jul What must be shall be
Par Come you to make confession to this father
Jul To answer that I should confess to you
Par Do not deny to him that you love me
Jul I will confess to you that I love him
Par So will ye I am sure that you love me
Jul If I do so it will be of more price
Being spoke behind your back than to your face
Jul The tears have got small victory by that
For it was bad enough before their spite
Jul That is no slander sir which is a truth
And what I spake I spake it to my face
Jul It may be so for it is not mine own
Are you at leisure holy father now
Or shall I come to you at evening mass
Friar My leisure serves me pensive daughter now
My lord we must entreat the time alone
Par God shield I should disturb devotion
Juliet on Thursday early will I rouse ye
Till then adieu and keep this holy kiss             Exit
Jul O shut the door and when thou hast done so
Friar Ah Juliet I already know thy grief
It strains me past the compass of my wits
I hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
On Thursday next be married to this County
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
Do thou but call my resolution wise
Shall be the label to another deed
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another this shall slay them both
Give me some present counsel or behold
Shall play the empire arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring
Be not so long to speak I long to die
Friar Hold daughter I do spy a kind of hope
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent
If rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame
Jul O bid me leap rather than marry Paris
From off the battlements of yonder tower
Or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
Where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
Or shut me nightly in a charnel house
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
And I will do it without fear or doubt
Friar Hold then Go home be merry give consent
Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
Take thou this vial being then in bed
And this distilled liquor drink thou off
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress but surcease
No warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
Like death when he shuts up the day of life
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death
And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
Then as the manner of our country is
In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie
In the mean time against thou shalt awake
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift
And hither shall he come and he and I
Will watch thy waking and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua
And this shall free thee from this present shame
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it
Jul Give me give me O tell not me of fear
Friar Hold Get you gone be strong and prosperous
To Mantua with my letters to thy lord
Jul Love give me strength and strength shall help afford
Farewell dear father
Exeunt
Scene II
Enter Father Capulet Mother Nurse and Servingmen
two or three
Cap So many guests invite as here are writ
Sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks

Cap How canst thou try them so
fingers Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with
Cap Go begone
Exit Servingman
What is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence
Nurse Ay forsooth
Cap Well be may chance to do some good on her
Enter Juliet
Nurse See where she comes from shrift with merry look
Cap How now my headstrong Where have you been gadding
Jul Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
To beg your pardon Pardon I beseech you
Cap Send for the County Go tell him of this
And gave him what becomed love I might
Ay marry go I say and fetch him hither
Now afore God this reverend holy friar
All our whole city is much bound to him
Jul Nurse will you go with me into my closet
To help me sort such needful ornaments
Mother No not till Thursday There is time enough
Exeunt Juliet and Nurse
Mother We shall be short in our provision
Cap Tush I will stir about
And all things shall be well I warrant thee wife
Go thou to Juliet help to deck up her
They are all forth well I will walk myself
To County Paris to prepare him up
Exeunt
Scene III
Enter Juliet and Nurse
Jul Ay those attires are best but gentle nurse
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state
Which well thou knowest is cross and full of sin
Enter Mother
Mother What are you busy ho Need you my help
So please you let me now be left alone
And let the nurse this night sit up with you
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business
Mother Good night
Get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
Jul Farewell God knows when we shall meet again
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life
My dismal scene I needs must act alone
Come vial
What if this mixture do not work at all
No No This shall forbid it Lie thou there
Lays down a dagger
What if it be a poison which the friar
Because he married me before to Romeo
I fear it is and yet methinks it should not
For he hath still been tried a holy man
I will not entertain so bad a thought
How if when I am laid into the tomb
I wake before the time that Romeo
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes
Or if I live is it not very like
The horrible conceit of death and night
As in a vault an ancient receptacle
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Where bloody Tybalt yet but green in earth
Alack alack is it not like that I
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
O if I wake shall I not be distraught
Environed with all these hideous fears
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Romeo I come this do I drink to thee
Scene IV
Enter Lady of the House and Nurse
Lady Hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
Nurse They call for dates and quinces in the pastry
Enter Old Capulet

But I will watch you from such watching now
Exeunt Lady and Nurse
Cap A jealous hood a jealous hood
What is there Now fellow
Fellow Things for the cook sir but I know not what

Fellow I have a head sir that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter
Cap Mass and well said a merry whoreson ha
The County will be here with music straight
For so he said he would                         Play music
I hear him near
Nurse Wife What ho What nurse I say
Enter Nurse
Go waken Juliet go and trim her up
Make haste The bridegroom he is come already
Make haste I say
Scene V
Nurse Mistress what mistress Juliet Fast I warrant her she
Why love I say madam sweetheart Why bride
What not a word You take your pennyworths now
Sleep for a week for the next night I warrant
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little God forgive me
Marry and amen How sound is she asleep
I needs must wake her Madam madam madam
Ay let the County take you in your bed
I must needs wake you Lady lady lady
O weraday that ever I was born
Enter Mother
Mother What noise is here
Nurse O lamentable day
Mother What is the matter
Nurse Look look O heavy day
Mother O me O me My child my only life
Revive look up or I will die with thee
Help help Call help
Enter Father
Father For shame bring Juliet forth her lord is come
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff
Life and these lips have long been separated
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field
Nurse O lamentable day
Mother O woful time
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
Friar Come is the bride ready to go to church
Cap Ready to go but never to return
O son the night before thy wedding day
Hath Death lain with thy wife See there she lies
Flower as she was deflowered by him
My daughter he hath wedded I will die
And doth it give me such a sight as this
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage
But one poor one one poor and loving child
But one thing to rejoice and solace in
Nurse O woe O woful woful woful day
Most lamentable day most woful day
That ever ever I did yet behold
O day O day O day O hateful day
Never was seen so black a day as this
O woful day O woful day
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown
O love O life not life but love in death
To murther murther our solemnity
O child O child my soul and not my child
Dead art thou dead alack my child is dead
And with my child my joys are buried
In these confusions Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
And all the better is it for the maid
Your part in her you could not keep from death
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life
The most you sought was her promotion
Above the clouds as high as heaven itself
O in this love you love your child so ill
That you run mad seeing that she is well
Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse and as the custom is
In all her best array bear her to church
For though fond nature bids us all lament
Cap All things that we ordained festival
Our instruments to melancholy bells
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
And all things change them to the contrary
Friar Sir go you in and madam go with him
And go Sir Paris Every one prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave
Move them no more by crossing their high will
1 Mus Faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
Nurse Honest good fellows ah put up put up
1 Mus Ay by my troth the case may be amended
Enter Peter
Pet You will not then
1 Mus No
Pet I will then give it you soundly
1 Mus What will you give us
Pet No money on my faith but the gleek I will give you the
minstrel
1 Mus An you re us and fa us you note us
2 Mus Pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit
wit and put up my iron dagger Answer me like men
And doleful dumps the mind oppress
What say you Simon Catling
1 Mus Marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
Pet Pretty What say You Hugh Rebeck
Pet Pretty too What say you James Soundpost
3 Mus Faith I know not what to say
Pet O I cry you mercy you are the singer I will say for you It
for sounding
1 Mus What a pestilent knave is this same
mourners and stay dinner

ACT V Scene I
Mantua A street
Enter Romeo
Rom If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
News from Verona How now Balthasar
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
How doth my lady Is my father well
How fares my Juliet That I ask again
For nothing can be ill if she be well
Man Then she is well and nothing can be ill
And her immortal part with angels lives
And presently took post to tell it you
O pardon me for bringing these ill news
Since you did leave it for my office sir
Thou knowest my lodging Get me ink and paper
Man I do beseech you sir have patience
Your looks are pale and wild and do import
Some misadventure
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar
Man No my good lord
Rom No matter Get thee gone
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men
I do remember an apothecary
Culling of simples Meagre were his looks
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung
A beggarly account of empty boxes
Green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scattered to make up a show
Noting this penury to myself I said
Whose sale is present death in Mantua
O this same thought did but forerun my need
And this same needy man must sell it me
As I remember this should be the house
Enter Apothecary
Apoth Who calls so loud
Rom Come hither man I see that thou art poor
Hold there is forty ducats Let me have
As will disperse itself through all the veins
Is death to any he that utters them
Rom Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
And fearest to die Famine is in thy cheeks
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
The world affords no law to make thee rich
Then be not poor but break it and take this
Apoth My poverty but not my will consents
Rom I pay thy poverty and not thy will
Apoth Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off and if you had the strength
Of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
Doing more murther in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
I sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
Farewell Buy food and get thyself in flesh
Come cordial and not poison go with me
Exeunt
Scene II
Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence
John Holy Franciscan friar brother ho
Enter Friar Laurence
Laur This same should be the voice of Friar John
Welcome from Mantua What says Romeo
Or if his mind be writ give me his letter
John Going to find a barefoot brother out
One of our order to associate me
Here in this city visiting the sick
And finding him the searchers of the town
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign
Laur Who bare my letter then to Romeo
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee
So fearful were they of infection
Laur Unhappy fortune By my brotherhood
The letter was not nice but full of charge
Of dear import and the neglecting it
May do much danger Friar John go hence
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell
Laur Now must I to the monument alone
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents
But I will write again to Mantua
Scene III
Verona A churchyard in it the monument of the Capulets
Par Give me thy torch boy Hence and stand aloof
Yet put it out for I would not be seen
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
But thou shalt hear it Whistle then to me
Give me those flowers Do as I bid thee go
Par Sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew
The obsequies that I for thee will keep
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
Whistle Boy
The boy gives warning something doth approach
Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch a mattock
and a crow of iron
Rom Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
Hold take this letter Early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father
Give me the light Upon thy life I charge thee
And do not interrupt me in my course
Why I descend into this bed of death
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
In dear employment Therefore hence be gone
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I farther shall intend to do
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea
Bal I will be gone sir and not trouble you
Rom So shalt thou show me friendship Take thou that
Live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow
Rom Thou detestable maw thou womb of death
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open
Romeo opens the tomb
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies I will apprehend him
Stop thy unhallowed toil vile Montague
Condemned villain I do apprehend thee
Obey and go with me for thou must die
Rom I must indeed and therefore came I hither
Fly hence and leave me Think upon these gone
Let them affright thee I beseech thee youth
But not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury O be gone
By heaven I love thee better than myself
Stay not be gone Live and hereafter say
Par I do defy thy conjuration
And apprehend thee for a felon here
Rom Wilt thou provoke me Then have at thee boy
They fight
Page O Lord they fight I will go call the watch
Par O I am slain If thou be merciful
Rom In faith I will Let me peruse this face
What said my man when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet
Said he not so or did I dream it so
Or am I mad hearing him talk of Juliet
To think it was so O give me thy hand
For here lies Juliet and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry which their keepers call
A lightning before death O how may I
Call this a lightning O my love my wife
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
Tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
O what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy
Why art thou yet so fair Shall I believe
That unsubstantial Death is amorous
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour
For fear of that I still will stay with thee
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again Here here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids O here
Will I set up my everlasting rest
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
Arms take your last embrace and lips O you
The doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death
Come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
Thou desperate pilot now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
Thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss I die          Falls
Friar Bliss be upon you Tell me good my friend
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls As I discern
One that you love
Friar Who is it
Bal Romeo
Friar How long hath he been there
Bal Full half an hour
Friar Go with me to the vault
Bal I dare not sir
My master knows not but I am gone hence
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents
O much I fear some ill unthrifty thing
Bal As I did sleep under this yew tree here
I dreamt my master and another fought
And that my master slew him
Friar Romeo
Alack alack what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre
What mean these masterless and gory swords
Romeo O pale Who else What Paris too
Is guilty of this lamentable chance The lady stirs
Juliet rises
Jul O comfortable friar where is my lord
I do remember well where I should be
And there I am Where is my Romeo
Friar I hear some noise Lady come from that nest
Of death contagion and unnatural sleep
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents Come come away
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns
Stay not to question for the watch is coming
Come go good Juliet I dare no longer stay
Jul Go get thee hence for I will not away
Poison I see hath been his timeless end
O churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
To help me after I will kiss thy lips
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
Thy lips are warm
This is thy sheath there rest and let me die
Boy This is the place There where the torch doth burn
Pitiful sight here lies the County slain
And Juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
Who here hath lain this two days buried
Go tell the Prince run to the Capulets
Raise up the Montagues some others search
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry
Chief Watch Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither
3 Watch Here is a friar that trembles sighs and weeps
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side
Chief Watch A great suspicion Stay the friar too
Prince What misadventure is so early up
That calls our person from our morning rest
Cap What should it be that they so shriek abroad
With open outcry toward our monument
Prince What fear is this which startles in our ears
Chief Watch Sovereign here lies the County Paris slain
And Romeo dead and Juliet dead before
Prince Search seek and know how this foul murder comes
With instruments upon them fit to open
Cap O heavens O wife look how our daughter bleeds
Is empty on the back of Montague
Wife O me this sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre
Prince Come Montague for thou art early up
To see thy son and heir more early down
What further woe conspires against mine age
Prince Look and thou shalt see
Mon O thou untaught what manners is in this
To press before thy father to a grave
Prince Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
Till we can clear these ambiguities
And know their spring their head their true descent
And then will I be general of your woes
And lead you even to death Meantime forbear
And let mischance be slave to patience
Bring forth the parties of suspicion
Friar I am the greatest able to do least
Yet most suspected as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murther
And here I stand both to impeach and purge
Prince Then say it once what thou dost know in this
Friar I will be brief for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale
Romeo there dead was husband to that Juliet
You to remove that siege of grief from her
To County Paris Then comes she to me
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage
Or in my cell there would she kill herself
A sleeping potion which so took effect
As I intended for it wrought on her
The form of death Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrowed grave
But he which bore my letter Friar John
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo
But when I came some minute ere the time
Of her awaking here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead
She wakes and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb
And she too desperate would not go with me
But as it seems did violence on herself
All this I know and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy and if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault let my old life
Unto the rigour of severest law
Prince We still have known thee for a holy man
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place to this same monument
This letter he early bid me give his father
If I departed not and left him there
Prince Give me the letter I will look on it
Sirrah what made your master in this place
And bid me stand aloof and so I did
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
And then I ran away to call the watch
Their course of love the tidings of her death
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor pothecary and therewithal
Came to this vault to die and lie with Juliet
Where be these enemies Capulet Montage
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
And I for winking at you discords too
Cap O brother Montague give me thy hand
Can I demand
Mon But I can give thee more
For I will raise her Statue in pure gold
That whiles Verona by that name is known
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet
Poor sacrifices of our enmity
Prince A glooming peace this morning with it brings
The sun for sorrow will not show his head
Go hence to have more talk of these sad things
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo
Exeunt omnes

INDUCTION SCENE I
Before an alehouse on a heath
Enter HOSTESS and SLY
HOSTESS A pair of stocks you rogue
chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror Therefore paucas
pallabris let the world slide Sessa
HOSTESS You will not pay for the glasses you have burst
SLY No not a denier Go by Saint Jeronimy go to thy cold bed
and warm thee
Exit
Wind horns Enter a LORD from bunting with his train
LORD Huntsman I charge thee tender well my hounds
At the hedge corner in the coldest fault
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound
FIRST HUNTSMAN Why Belman is as good as he my lord
He cried upon it at the merest loss
Trust me I take him for the better dog
LORD Thou art a fool if Echo were as fleet
I would esteem him worth a dozen such
But sup them well and look unto them all
FIRST HUNTSMAN I will my lord
See doth he breathe
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
LORD O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
Sirs I will practise on this drunken man
A most delicious banquet by his bed
And brave attendants near him when he wakes
Would not the beggar then forget himself
FIRST HUNTSMAN Believe me lord I think he cannot choose
Then take him up and manage well the jest
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet
Procure me music ready when he wakes
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
And if he chance to speak be ready straight
And with a low submissive reverence
Let one attend him with a silver basin
Another bear the ewer the third a diaper
Some one be ready with a costly suit
And ask him what apparel he will wear
Another tell him of his hounds and horse
And that his lady mourns at his disease
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic
And when he says he is say that he dreams
For he is nothing but a mighty lord
This do and do it kindly gentle sirs
It will be pastime passing excellent
If it be husbanded with modesty
FIRST HUNTSMAN My lord I warrant you we will play our part
As he shall think by our true diligence
He is no less than what we say he is
LORD Take him up gently and to bed with him
And each one to his office when he wakes
Exit SERVANT
Belike some noble gentleman that means
Travelling some journey to repose him here
How now who is it
That offer service to your lordship
LORD Bid them come near
Enter PLAYERS
Now fellows you are welcome
PLAYERS We thank your honour
PLAYER So please your lordship to accept our duty
LORD With all my heart This fellow I remember
I have forgot your name but sure that part
Well you are come to me in happy time
The rather for I have some sport in hand
Wherein your cunning can assist me much
But I am doubtful of your modesties
For yet his honour never heard a play
You break into some merry passion
And so offend him for I tell you sirs
If you should smile he grows impatient
PLAYER Fear not my lord we can contain ourselves
Were he the veriest antic in the world
LORD Go sirrah take them to the buttery
And give them friendly welcome every one
Let them want nothing that my house affords
Exit one with the PLAYERS
Sirrah go you to Bartholomew my page
He bear himself with honourable action
Unto their lords by them accomplished
Such duty to the drunkard let him do
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
Wherein your lady and your humble wife
And then with kind embracements tempting kisses
And with declining head into his bosom
Bid him shed tears as being overjoyed
Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar
To rain a shower of commanded tears
An onion will do well for such a shift
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye
I know the boy will well usurp the grace
Voice gait and action of a gentlewoman
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
When they do homage to this simple peasant
Which otherwise would grow into extremes             Exeunt
SC_2
SCENE II
Enter aloft SLY with ATTENDANTS some with apparel basin
and ewer and other appurtenances and LORD
for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than
shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather
LORD Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour
O that a mighty man of such descent
Of such possessions and so high esteem
Should be infused with so foul a spirit
SLY What would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly old
Wincot if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on
THIRD SERVANT O this it is that makes your lady mourn
SECOND SERVANT O this is it that makes your servants droop
LORD Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy
O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams
Look how thy servants do attend on thee
Each in his office ready at thy beck
And twenty caged nightingales do sing
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl
Dost thou love hawking Thou hast hawks will soar
Above the morning lark Or wilt thou hunt
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth
FIRST SERVANT Say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
SECOND SERVANT Dost thou love pictures We will fetch thee
straight
Adonis painted by a running brook
And Cytherea all in sedges hid
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath
As lively painted as the deed was done
THIRD SERVANT Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
LORD Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
Than any woman in this waning age
FIRST SERVANT And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
She was the fairest creature in the world
And yet she is inferior to none
SLY Am I a lord and have I such a lady
I do not sleep I see I hear I speak
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things
Upon my life I am a lord indeed
And not a tinker nor Christopher Sly
Well bring our lady hither to our sight
O that once more you knew but what you are
These fifteen years you have been in a dream
SLY These fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
But did I never speak of all that time
FIRST SERVANT O yes my lord but very idle words
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
And rail upon the hostess of the house
And say you would present her at the leet
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket
THIRD SERVANT Why sir you know no house nor no such maid
As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
And twenty more such names and men as these
Which never were nor no man ever saw
SLY Now Lord be thanked for my good amends
ALL Amen
Enter the PAGE as a lady with ATTENDANTS
SLY I thank thee thou shalt not lose by it
PAGE How fares my noble lord
SLY Marry I fare well for here is cheer enough
Where is my wife
PAGE Here noble lord what is thy will with her
SLY Are you my wife and will not call me husband
PAGE My husband and my lord my lord and husband
I am your wife in all obedience
SLY I know it well What must I call her
LORD Madam
LORD Madam and nothing else so lords call ladies
And slept above some fifteen year or more
PAGE Ay and the time seems thirty unto me
Exeunt SERVANTS
Madam undress you and come now to bed
PAGE Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
To pardon me yet for a night or two
Or if not so until the sun be set
In peril to incur your former malady
That I should yet absent me from your bed
I hope this reason stands for my excuse
SLY Ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long But I would
be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in
despite of the flesh and the blood
Enter a MESSENGER
Are come to play a pleasant comedy
For so your doctors hold it very meet
And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy
Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
And frame your mind to mirth and merriment
Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
SLY Marry I will let them play it Is not a comonty a
PAGE No my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
SLY What household stuff
PAGE It is a kind of history
A flourish of trumpets announces the play

ACT I SCENE I
Padua A public place
Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO
LUCENTIO Tranio since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua nursery of arts
The pleasant garden of great Italy
With his good will and thy good company
Here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies
Pisa renowned for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first
A merchant of great traffic through the world
Vincentio come of the Bentivolii
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds
And therefore Tranio for the time I study
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness
Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left
And am to Padua come as he that leaves
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
TRANIO Mi perdonato gentle master mine
I am in all affected as yourself
Glad that you thus continue your resolve
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
Only good master while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
And practise rhetoric in your common talk
Music and poesy use to quicken you
The mathematics and the metaphysics
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
In brief sir study what you most affect
LUCENTIO Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise
If Biondello thou wert come ashore
We could at once put us in readiness
And take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget
Enter BAPTISTA with his two daughters KATHERINA
and BIANCA GREMIO a pantaloon HORTENSIO
suitor to BIANCA LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by
But stay awhile what company is this
TRANIO Master some show to welcome us to town
BAPTISTA Gentlemen importune me no farther
That is not to bestow my youngest daughter
Before I have a husband for the elder
If either of you both love Katherina
Because I know you well and love you well
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure
There there Hortensio will you any wife
To make a stale of me amongst these mates
HORTENSIO Mates maid How mean you that No mates for you
Unless you were of gentler milder mould
Iwis it is not halfway to her heart
But if it were doubt not her care should be
And paint your face and use you like a fool
HORTENSIO From all such devils good Lord deliver us
GREMIO And me too good Lord
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward
Peace Tranio
TRANIO Well said master mum and gaze your fill
BAPTISTA Gentlemen that I may soon make good
And let it not displease thee good Bianca
KATHERINA A pretty peat it is best
Put finger in the eye an she knew why
BIANCA Sister content you in my discontent
Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe
My books and instruments shall be my company
On them to look and practise by myself
LUCENTIO Hark Tranio thou mayst hear Minerva speak
HORTENSIO Signior Baptista will you be so strange
Sorry am I that our good will effects
GREMIO Why will you mew her up
Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell
And make her bear the penance of her tongue
Go in Bianca                                   Exit BIANCA
And for I know she taketh most delight
In music instruments and poetry
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house
Fit to instruct her youth If you Hortensio
Or Signior Gremio you know any such
Prefer them hither for to cunning men
I will be very kind and liberal
And so farewell Katherina you may stay
For I have more to commune with Bianca                 Exit
KATHERINA Why and I trust I may go too may I not
What shall I be appointed hours as though belike
I knew not what to take and what to leave Ha          Exit
Hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly
I bear my sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit man
to teach her that wherein she delights I will wish him to her
father
HORTENSIO SO Will I Signior Gremio but a word I pray Though
labour and effect one thing specially
HORTENSIO Marry sir to get a husband for her sister
GREMIO A husband a devil
HORTENSIO I say a husband
be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
HORTENSIO Tush Gremio Though it pass your patience and mine to
endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the
world an a man could light on them would take her with all
faults and money enough
GREMIO I cannot tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this
apples But come since this bar in law makes us friends it
be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring How say you
Signior Gremio
GREMIO I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in
Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her
and bed her and rid the house of her Come on
Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO
TRANIO I pray sir tell me is it possible
That love should of a sudden take such hold
LUCENTIO O Tranio till I found it to be true
I never thought it possible or likely
But see while idly I stood looking on
I found the effect of love in idleness
And now in plainness do confess to thee
That art to me as secret and as dear
Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio
If I achieve not this young modest girl
Counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst
Assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt
TRANIO Master it is no time to chide you now
Affection is not rated from the heart
LUCENTIO Gramercies lad Go forward this contents
LUCENTIO O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face
Such as the daughter of Agenor had
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand
Began to scold and raise up such a storm
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din
LUCENTIO Tranio I saw her coral lips to move
And with her breath she did perfume the air
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her
I pray awake sir If you love the maid
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her Thus it stands
Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his hands of her
Master your love must live a maid at home
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
LUCENTIO I have it Tranio
TRANIO Master for my hand
Both our inventions meet and jump in one
LUCENTIO Tell me thine first
TRANIO You will be schoolmaster
LUCENTIO It is May it be done
TRANIO Not possible for who shall bear your part
Keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
Visit his countrymen and banquet them
LUCENTIO Basta content thee for I have it full
We have not yet been seen in any house
For man or master Then it follows thus
Thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead
Keep house and port and servants as I should
Some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa
When Biondello comes he waits on thee
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue
In brief sir sith it your pleasure is
I am content to be Lucentio
Because so well I love Lucentio
LUCENTIO Tranio be so because Lucentio loves
Enter BIONDELLO
Here comes the rogue Sirrah where have you been
BIONDELLO Where have I been Nay how now where are you
And therefore frame your manners to the time
Your fellow Tranio here to save my life
And I for my escape have put on his
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
Wait you on him I charge you as becomes
While I make way from hence to save my life
You understand me
LUCENTIO And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth
BIONDELLO The better for him would I were so too
TRANIO So could I faith boy to have the next wish after
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies
When I am alone why then I am Tranio
But in all places else your master Lucentio
Sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty      Exeunt
The Presenters above speak
FIRST SERVANT My lord you nod you do not mind the play
SLY Yes by Saint Anne do I A good matter surely comes there
any more of it
SCENE II
Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO
PETRUCHIO Verona for a while I take my leave
To see my friends in Padua but of all
My best beloved and approved friend
Hortensio and I trow this is his house
Here sirrah Grumio knock I say
GRUMIO Knock sir Whom should I knock
PETRUCHIO Villain I say knock me here soundly
GRUMIO Knock you here sir Why sir what am I sir that I
should knock you here sir
PETRUCHIO Villain I say knock me at this gate
GRUMIO My master is grown quarrelsome I should knock you first
And then I know after who comes by the worst
PETRUCHIO Will it not be
GRUMIO Help masters help My master is mad
PETRUCHIO Now knock when I bid you sirrah villain
Enter HORTENSIO
good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona
PETRUCHIO Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray
HORTENSIO Alla nostra casa ben venuto
Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio
Rise Grumio rise we will compound this quarrel
he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir Well was it fit
for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught I
see two and thirty a pip out
Then had not Grumio come by the worst
PETRUCHIO A senseless villain Good Hortensio
I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
And could not get him for my heart to do it
GRUMIO Knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words
PETRUCHIO Sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you
Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio
And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona
PETRUCHIO Such wind as scatters young men through the world
To seek their fortunes farther than at home
Where small experience grows But in a few
Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me
And I have thrust myself into this maze
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home
And so am come abroad to see the world
HORTENSIO Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee
Few words suffice and therefore if thou know
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
She moves me not or not removes at least
As are the swelling Adriatic seas
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua
If wealthily then happily in Padua
GRUMIO Nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is
Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an
she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses Why nothing
comes amiss so money comes withal
I can Petruchio help thee to a wife
With wealth enough and young and beauteous
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman
Her only fault and that is faults enough
And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
That were my state far worser than it is
I would not wed her for a mine of gold
For I will board her though she chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
HORTENSIO Her father is Baptista Minola
An affable and courteous gentleman
Her name is Katherina Minola
PETRUCHIO I know her father though I know not her
And he knew my deceased father well
I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her
And therefore let me be thus bold with you
To give you over at this first encounter
Unless you will accompany me thither
word and she knew him as well as I do she would think scolding
would do little good upon him She may perhaps call him half a
him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so
disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see
withal than a cat You know him not sir
HORTENSIO Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee
He hath the jewel of my life in hold
His youngest daughter beautiful Bianca
And her withholds from me and other more
Suitors to her and rivals in my love
That none shall have access unto Bianca
Till Katherine the curst have got a husband
GRUMIO Katherine the curst
A title for a maid of all titles the worst
HORTENSIO Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
Well seen in music to instruct Bianca
That so I may by this device at least
Have leave and leisure to make love to her
And unsuspected court her by herself
Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO disguised as CAMBIO
young folks lay their heads together Master master look about
you Who goes there ha
HORTENSIO Peace Grumio It is the rival of my love Petruchio
stand by awhile
GRUMIO A proper stripling and an amorous
All books of love see that at any hand
And see you read no other lectures to her
For she is sweeter than perfume itself
To whom they go to What will you read to her
As firmly as yourself were still in place
Yea and perhaps with more successful words
Than you unless you were a scholar sir
GREMIO O this learning what a thing it is
GRUMIO O this woodcock what an ass it is
PETRUCHIO Peace sirrah
God save you Signior Gremio
GREMIO And you are well met Signior Hortensio
Trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca
And by good fortune I have lighted well
On this young man for learning and behaviour
Fit for her turn well read in poetry
A fine musician to instruct our mistress
So shall I no whit be behind in duty
To fair Bianca so beloved of me
GRUMIO And that his bags shall prove
Listen to me and if you speak me fair
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met
Upon agreement from us to his liking
Will undertake to woo curst Katherine
Yea and to marry her if her dowry please
GREMIO So said so done is well
Hortensio have you told him all her faults
PETRUCHIO I know she is an irksome brawling scold
If that be all masters I hear no harm
My father dead my fortune lives for me
And I do hope good days and long to see
GREMIO O Sir such a life with such a wife were strange
You shall have me assisting you in all
PETRUCHIO Will I live
PETRUCHIO Why came I hither but to that intent
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears
Have I not in my time heard lions roar
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field
Have I not in a pitched battle heard
That gives not half so great a blow to hear
Tush tush fear boys with bugs
GRUMIO For he fears none
GREMIO Hortensio hark
My mind presumes for his own good and ours
GRUMIO I would I were as sure of a good dinner
Enter TRANIO bravely apparelled as LUCENTIO and BIONDELLO
TRANIO Gentlemen God save you If I may be bold
Tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola
TRANIO Even he Biondello
TRANIO Perhaps him and her sir what have you to do
PETRUCHIO Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray
HORTENSIO Sir a word ere you go
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
TRANIO And if I be sir is it any offence
GREMIO No if without more words you will get you hence
TRANIO Why sir I pray are not the streets as free
For me as for you
GREMIO But so is not she
TRANIO For what reason I beseech you
TRANIO Softly my masters If you be gentlemen
Baptista is a noble gentleman
To whom my father is not all unknown
And were his daughter fairer than she is
She may more suitors have and me for one
Then well one more may fair Bianca have
And so she shall Lucentio shall make one
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone
PETRUCHIO Hortensio to what end are all these words
HORTENSIO Sir let me be so bold as ask you
TRANIO No sir but hear I do that he hath two
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty
GREMIO Yea leave that labour to great Hercules
PETRUCHIO Sir understand you this of me in sooth
The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
Her father keeps from all access of suitors
And will not promise her to any man
Until the elder sister first be wed
The younger then is free and not before
TRANIO If it be so sir that you are the man
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest
And if you break the ice and do this feat
Achieve the elder set the younger free
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate
HORTENSIO Sir you say well and well you do conceive
And since you do profess to be a suitor
You must as we do gratify this gentleman
To whom we all rest generally beholding
TRANIO Sir I shall not be slack in sign whereof
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon
Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto                Exeunt

Enter KATHERINA and BIANCA
BIANCA Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself
That I disdain but for these other gawds
Yea all my raiment to my petticoat
Or what you will command me will I do
So well I know my duty to my elders
KATHERINA Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
BIANCA Believe me sister of all the men alive
I never yet beheld that special face
Which I could fancy more than any other
BIANCA If you affect him sister here I swear
KATHERINA O then belike you fancy riches more
You will have Gremio to keep you fair
BIANCA Is it for him you do envy me so
Nay then you jest and now I well perceive
You have but jested with me all this while
I prithee sister Kate untie my hands
Enter BAPTISTA
BAPTISTA Why how now dame Whence grows this insolence
Go ply thy needle meddle not with her
For shame thou hilding of a devilish spirit
When did she cross thee with a bitter word
BAPTISTA What in my sight Bianca get thee in
Exit BIANCA
KATHERINA What will you not suffer me Nay now I see
She is your treasure she must have a husband
And for your love to her lead apes in hell

But who comes here
Enter GREMIO with LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man
PETRUCHIO with HORTENSIO as a musician and TRANIO
as LUCENTIO with his boy BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books
GREMIO Good morrow neighbour Baptista
BAPTISTA Good morrow neighbour Gremio
God save you gentlemen
PETRUCHIO And you good sir Pray have you not a daughter
GREMIO You are too blunt go to it orderly
PETRUCHIO You wrong me Signior Gremio give me leave
I am a gentleman of Verona sir
That hearing of her beauty and her wit
Her affability and bashful modesty
Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
Within your house to make mine eye the witness
Of that report which I so oft have heard
And for an entrance to my entertainment
I do present you with a man of mine
Cunning in music and the mathematics
To instruct her fully in those sciences
Whereof I know she is not ignorant
His name is Licio born in Mantua
But for my daughter Katherine this I know
She is not for your turn the more my grief
PETRUCHIO I see you do not mean to part with her
Or else you like not of my company
BAPTISTA Mistake me not I speak but as I find
Whence are you sir What may I call your name
A man well known throughout all Italy
BAPTISTA I know him well you are welcome for his sake
GREMIO Saving your tale Petruchio I pray
Let us that are poor petitioners speak too
Bacare you are marvellous forward
PETRUCHIO O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing
GREMIO I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing
Neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it To
express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly
beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young
Rheims as cunning in Greek Latin and other languages as the
other in music and mathematics His name is Cambio Pray accept
his service
BAPTISTA A thousand thanks Signior Gremio Welcome good Cambio
May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming
TRANIO Pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
That being a stranger in this city here
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter
Unto Bianca fair and virtuous
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
In the preferment of the eldest sister
That upon knowledge of my parentage
And free access and favour as the rest
And toward the education of your daughters
I here bestow a simple instrument
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books
If you accept them then their worth is great
BAPTISTA Lucentio is your name Of whence I pray
TRANIO Of Pisa sir son to Vincentio
BAPTISTA A mighty man of Pisa By report
I know him well You are very welcome sir
Take you the lute and you the set of books
You shall go see your pupils presently
Holla within
Enter a SERVANT
Sirrah lead these gentlemen
To my daughters and tell them both
These are their tutors Bid them use them well
Exit SERVANT leading HORTENSIO carrying the lute
and LUCENTIO with the books
We will go walk a little in the orchard
And then to dinner You are passing welcome
And so I pray you all to think yourselves
PETRUCHIO Signior Baptista my business asketh haste
And every day I cannot come to woo
You knew my father well and in him me
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods
What dowry shall I have with her to wife
BAPTISTA After my death the one half of my lands
And in possession twenty thousand crowns
Her widowhood be it that she survive me
In all my lands and leases whatsoever
Let specialities be therefore drawn between us
That covenants may be kept on either hand
That is her love for that is all in all
PETRUCHIO Why that is nothing for I tell you father
And where two raging fires meet together
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury
Though little fire grows great with little wind
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
So I to her and so she yields to me
For I am rough and woo not like a babe
BAPTISTA Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
PETRUCHIO Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
That shake not though they blow perpetually
BAPTISTA How now my friend Why dost thou look so pale
HORTENSIO For fear I promise you if I look pale
BAPTISTA What will my daughter prove a good musician
Iron may hold with her but never lutes
BAPTISTA Why then thou canst not break her to the lute
HORTENSIO Why no for she hath broke the lute to me
I did but tell her she mistook her frets
When with a most impatient devilish spirit
And with that word she struck me on the head
And through the instrument my pate made way
And there I stood amazed for a while
As on a pillory looking through the lute
While she did call me rascal fiddler
And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms
As she had studied to misuse me so
PETRUCHIO Now by the world it is a lusty wench
O how I long to have some chat with her
BAPTISTA Well go with me and be not so discomfited
Proceed in practice with my younger daughter
Signior Petruchio will you go with us
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you
PETRUCHIO I pray you do             Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
And woo her with some spirit when she comes
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale
Say she be mute and will not speak a word
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence
As though she bid me stay by her a week
When I shall ask the banns and when be married
But here she comes Lndnow Petruchio speak
Enter KATHERINA
KATHERINA Well have you heard but something hard of hearing
They call me Katherine that do talk of me
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst
But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom
For dainties are all Kates and therefore Kate
Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
Remove you hence I knew you at the first
You were a moveable
PETRUCHIO Thou hast hit it Come sit on me
KATHERINA Asses are made to bear and so are you
PETRUCHIO Women are made to bear and so are you
KATHERINA No such jade as you if me you mean
PETRUCHIO Alas good Kate I will not burden thee
KATHERINA Too light for such a swain as you to catch
And yet as heavy as my weight should be
KATHERINA Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
KATHERINA If I be waspish best beware my sting
PETRUCHIO My remedy is then to pluck it out
KATHERINA Ay if the fool could find it where it lies
PETRUCHIO Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting
In his tail
KATHERINA In his tongue
PETRUCHIO Whose tongue
KATHERINA Yours if you talk of tales and so farewell
PETRUCHIO What with my tongue in your tail Nay come again
Good Kate I am a gentleman
KATHERINA So may you lose your arms
If you strike me you are no gentleman
And if no gentleman why then no arms
PETRUCHIO A herald Kate O put me in thy books
PETRUCHIO A combless cock so Kate will be my hen
KATHERINA No cock of mine you crow too like a craven
PETRUCHIO Nay come Kate come you must not look so sour
KATHERINA It is my fashion when I see a crab
KATHERINA There is there is
PETRUCHIO Then show it me
KATHERINA Had I a glass I would
PETRUCHIO What you mean my face
PETRUCHIO Now by Saint George I am too young for you
KATHERINA I care not
KATHERINA I chafe you if I tarry let me go
PETRUCHIO No not a whit I find you passing gentle
And now I find report a very liar
For thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous
But slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers
Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
With gentle conference soft and affable
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
O let me see thee walk Thou dost not halt
PETRUCHIO Did ever Dian so become a grove
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait
O be thou Dian and let her be Kate
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful
KATHERINA Where did you study all this goodly speech
PETRUCHIO It is extempore from my mother wit
KATHERINA A witty mother witless else her son
PETRUCHIO Am I not wise
KATHERINA Yes keep you warm
PETRUCHIO Marry so I mean sweet Katherine in thy bed
And therefore setting all this chat aside
Thus in plain terms your father hath consented
That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
And will you nill you I will marry you
Now Kate I am a husband for your turn
For by this light whereby I see thy beauty
Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
Thou must be married to no man but me
For I am he am born to tame you Kate
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
Conformable as other household Kates
Here comes your father Never make denial
I must and will have Katherine to my wife
BAPTISTA Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter
PETRUCHIO How but well sir how but well
It were impossible I should speed amiss
BAPTISTA Why how now daughter Katherine in your dumps
KATHERINA Call you me daughter Now I promise you
To wish me wed to one half lunatic
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out
If she be curst it is for policy
She is not hot but temperate as the morn
For patience she will prove a second Grissel
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity
PETRUCHIO Be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself
That she shall still be curst in company
She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
She vied so fast protesting oath on oath
That in a twink she won me to her love
How tame when men and women are alone
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
Give me thy hand Kate I will unto Venice
Provide the feast father and bid the guests
I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine
BAPTISTA I know not what to say but give me your hands
GREMIO TRANIO Amen say we we will be witnesses
PETRUCHIO Father and wife and gentlemen adieu
I will to Venice Sunday comes apace
We will have rings and things and fine array
And kiss me Kate we will be married a Sunday
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA severally
And venture madly on a desperate mart
BAPTISTA The gain I seek is quiet in the match
GREMIO No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
But now Baptista to your younger daughter
Now is the day we long have looked for
I am your neighbour and was suitor first
TRANIO And I am one that love Bianca more
Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
GREMIO Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I
TRANIO Greybeard thy love doth freeze
GREMIO But thine doth fry
BAPTISTA Content you gentlemen I will compound this strife
That can assure my daughter greatest dower
Say Signior Gremio what can you assure her
GREMIO First as you know my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints
Costly apparel tents and canopies
Pewter and brass and all things that belongs
To house or housekeeping Then at my farm
Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls
And all things answerable to this portion
Myself am struck in years I must confess
If whilst I live she will be only mine
If I may have your daughter to my wife
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua
Besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
GREMIO Two thousand ducats by the year of land
That she shall have besides an argosy
That now is lying in Marseilles road
Than three great argosies besides two galliasses
And twelve tight galleys These I will assure her
And she can have no more than all I have
If you like me she shall have me and mine
TRANIO Why then the maid is mine from all the world
BAPTISTA I must confess your offer is the best
And let your father make her the assurance
She is your own Else you must pardon me
GREMIO And may not young men die as well as old
BAPTISTA Well gentlemen
My daughter Katherine is to be married
Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca
Be bride to you if you make this assurance
If not to Signior Gremio
And so I take my leave and thank you both
GREMIO Adieu good neighbour                   Exit BAPTISTA
Now I fear thee not
Sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
To give thee all and in his waning age
Set foot under thy table Tut a toy
An old Italian fox is not so kind my boy              Exit
TRANIO A vengeance on your crafty withered hide
Do get their children but in this case of wooing
A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning
Exit

ACT III SCENE I
Enter LUCENTIO as CAMBIO HORTENSIO as LICIO and BIANCA
LUCENTIO Fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
HORTENSIO But wrangling pedant this is
The patroness of heavenly harmony
Then give me leave to have prerogative
And when in music we have spent an hour
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much
LUCENTIO Preposterous ass that never read so far
Was it not to refresh the mind of man
After his studies or his usual pain
Then give me leave to read philosophy
And while I pause serve in your harmony
HORTENSIO Sirrah I will not bear these braves of thine
BIANCA Why gentlemen you do me double wrong
To strive for that which resteth in my choice
I arn no breeching scholar in the schools
But learn my lessons as I please myself
And to cut off all strife here sit we down
Take you your instrument play you the whiles
BIANCA Where left we last
LUCENTIO Here madam
BIANCA Construe them
LUCENTIO Spit in the hole man and tune again
LUCENTIO All but the bass
Now for my life the knave doth court my love
BIANCA In time I may believe yet I mistrust
BIANCA I must believe my master else I promise you
I should be arguing still upon that doubt
But let it rest Now Licio to you
Good master take it not unkindly pray
That I have been thus pleasant with you both
awhile
My lessons make no music in three Parts
LUCENTIO Are you so formal sir Well I must wait
Our fine musician groweth amorous
HORTENSIO Madam before you touch the instrument
To learn the order of my fingering
I must begin with rudiments of art
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort
More pleasant pithy and effectual
Than hath been taught by any of my trade
And there it is in writing fairly drawn
BIANCA Why I am past my gamut long ago
HORTENSIO Yet read the gamut of Hortensio
Call you this gamut Tut I like it not
Old fashions please me best I am not so nice
To change true rules for odd inventions
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT Mistress your father prays you leave your books
BIANCA Farewell sweet masters both I must be gone
Exeunt BIANCA and SERVANT
LUCENTIO Faith mistress then I have no cause to stay
Exit
HORTENSIO But I have cause to pry into this pedant
Methinks he looks as though he were in love
Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble
Seize thee that list If once I find thee ranging
HORTENSIO will be quit with thee by changing             Exit
SCENE II
Enter BAPTISTA GREMIO TRANIO as LUCENTIO KATHERINA BIANCA
LUCENTIO as CAMBIO and ATTENDANTS
That Katherine and Petruchio should be married
What will be said What mockery will it be
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours
I told you I he was a frantic fool
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour
And to be noted for a merry man
Make friends invited and proclaim the banns
Now must the world point at poor Katherine
TRANIO Patience good Katherine and Baptista too
Upon my life Petruchio means but well
Whatever fortune stays him from his word
Though he be blunt I know him passing wise
KATHERINA Would Katherine had never seen him though
Exit weeping followed by BIANCA and others
BAPTISTA Go girl I cannot blame thee now to weep
For such an injury would vex a very saint
Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
Enter BIONDELLO
Master master News and such old news as you never heard of
BAPTISTA Is it new and old too How may that be
BAPTISTA Is he come
BIONDELLO Why no sir
BAPTISTA What then
BIONDELLO He is coming
BAPTISTA When will he be here
BIONDELLO When he stands where I am and sees you there
TRANIO But say what to thine old news
with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with
the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped
with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives
being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often
BAPTISTA Who comes with him
monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian
BIONDELLO Why sir he comes not
BAPTISTA Didst thou not say he comes
BIONDELLO Who that Petruchio came
BAPTISTA Ay that Petruchio came
BIONDELLO No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back
BIONDELLO Nay by Saint Jamy
I hold you a penny
A horse and a man
Is more than one
And yet not many
Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO
BAPTISTA You are welcome sir
PETRUCHIO And yet I come not well
BAPTISTA And yet you halt not
As I wish you were
PETRUCHIO Were it better I should rush in thus
But where is Kate Where is my lovely bride
How does my father Gentles methinks you frown
And wherefore gaze this goodly company
As if they saw some wondrous monument
Some comet or unusual prodigy
First were we sad fearing you would not come
Now sadder that you come so unprovided
Fie doff this habit shame to your estate
TRANIO And tell us what occasion of import
And sent you hither so unlike yourself
PETRUCHIO Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word
Though in some part enforced to digress
Which at more leisure I will so excuse
As you shall well be satisfied withal
But where is Kate I stay too long from her
TRANIO See not your bride in these unreverent robes
Go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
BAPTISTA But thus I trust you will not marry her
Could I repair what she will wear in me
As I can change these poor accoutrements
But what a fool am I to chat with you
And seal the title with a lovely kiss
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and PETRUCHIO
TRANIO He hath some meaning in his mad attire
We will persuade him be it possible
To put on better ere he go to church
Exeunt BAPTISTA GREMIO BIONDELLO and ATTENDENTS
TRANIO But to her love concerneth us to ad
As I before imparted to your worship
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa
And make assurance here in Padua
Of greater sums than I have promised
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope
And marry sweet Bianca with consent
LUCENTIO Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster
TRANIO That by degrees we mean to look into
And watch our vantage in this business
Signior Gremio came you from the church
TRANIO And is the bride and bridegroom coming home
A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
Should ask if Katherine should be his wife
That down fell priest and book and book and priest
TRANIO What said the wench when he rose again
As if the vicar meant to cozen him
But after many ceremonies done
He had been abroad carousing to his mates
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
This done he took the bride about the neck
That at the parting all the church did echo
And I seeing this came thence for very shame
And after me I know the rout is coming
Such a mad marriage never was before
Enter PETRUCHIO KATHERINA BIANCA BAPTISTA HORTENSIO
GRUMIO and train
PETRUCHIO Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains
And therefore here I mean to take my leave
Make it no wonder if you knew my business
You would entreat me rather go than stay
And honest company I thank you all
That have beheld me give away myself
To this most patient sweet and virtuous wife
Dine with my father drink a health to me
For I must hence and farewell to you all
TRANIO Let us entreat you stay till after dinner
PETRUCHIO It may not be
GREMIO Let me entreat you
PETRUCHIO It cannot be
KATHERINA Let me entreat you
PETRUCHIO I am content
KATHERINA Are you content to stay
PETRUCHIO I am content you shall entreat me stay
But yet not stay entreat me how you can
KATHERINA Now if you love me stay
PETRUCHIO Grumio my horse
GRUMIO Ay sir they be ready the oats have eaten the horses
KATHERINA Nay then
The door is open sir there lies your way
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green
That take it on you at the first so roundly
PETRUCHIO O Kate content thee prithee be not angry
KATHERINA I will be angry what hast thou to do
Father be quiet he shall stay my leisure
GREMIO Ay marry sir now it begins to work
KATHERINA Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner
I see a woman may be made a fool
If she had not a spirit to resist
PETRUCHIO They shall go forward Kate at thy command
Obey the bride you that attend on her
Go to the feast revel and domineer
Carouse full measure to her maidenhead
Be mad and merry or go hang yourselves
But for my bonny Kate she must with me
Nay look not big nor stamp nor stare nor fret
She is my goods my chattels she is my house
My household stuff my field my barn
My horse my ox my ass my any thing
And here she stands touch her whoever dare
That stops my way in Padua Grumio
Draw forth thy weapon we are beset with thieves
Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man
Fear not sweet wench they shall not touch thee Kate
Exeunt PETRUCHIO KATHERINA and GRUMIO
BAPTISTA Nay let them go a couple of quiet ones
GREMIO Went they not quickly I should die with laughing
TRANIO Of all mad matches never was the like
GREMIO I warrant him Petruchio is Kated
BAPTISTA Neighbours and friends though bride and bridegroom wants
For to supply the places at the table
You know there wants no junkets at the feast
TRANIO Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it
Exeunt

GRUMIO Fie fie on all tired jades on all mad masters and all
ever man so weary I am sent before to make a fire and they are
coming after to warm them Now were not I a little pot and soon
hot my very lips might freeze to my teeth my tongue to the roof

neck A fire good Curtis

GRUMIO O ay Curtis ay and therefore fire fire cast on no
water

office
CURTIS I prithee good Grumio tell me how goes the world
GRUMIO A cold world Curtis in every office but thine and
therefore fire Do thy duty and have thy duty for my master and
mistress are almost frozen to death
GRUMIO Why therefore fire for I have caught extreme cold
Be the jacks fair within the jills fair without the carpets

CURTIS All ready and therefore I pray thee news

CURTIS How
GRUMIO Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a
tale
GRUMIO Lend thine ear
CURTIS Here
Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my
CURTIS Both of one horse
CURTIS Why a horse
shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse
thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place how she was
because her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt to
before how I cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was
thy grave
GRUMIO Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find
when he comes home But what talk I of this Call forth

NATHANIEL All things is ready How near is our master
Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
PETRUCHIO Where be these knaves What no man at door
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse
Where is Nathaniel Gregory Philip
ALL SERVANTS Here here sir here sir
PETRUCHIO Here sir here sir here sir here sir
What no attendance no regard no duty
Where is the foolish knave I sent before
GRUMIO Here sir as foolish as I was before
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee
There were none fine but Adam Ralph and Gregory
The rest were ragged old and beggarly
Yet as they are here are they come to meet you
PETRUCHIO Go rascals go and fetch my supper in
Exeunt some of the SERVINGMEN
Sit down Kate and welcome Soud soud soud soud
Why when I say Nay good sweet Kate be merry
Off with my boots you rogues you villains when
Out you rogue you pluck my foot awry
Take that and mend the plucking off the other
Be merry Kate Some water here what ho
Enter one with water
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither
Exit SERVINGMAN
One Kate that you must kiss and be acquainted with
Where are my slippers Shall I have some water
Come Kate and wash and welcome heartily
Come Kate sit down I know you have a stomach
Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I
FIRST SERVANT Ay
PETRUCHIO Who brought it
PETER I
What dogs are these Where is the rascal cook
How durst you villains bring it from the dresser
And serve it thus to me that love it not
There take it to you trenchers cups and all
Exeunt SERVANTS
KATHERINA I pray you husband be not so disquiet
The meat was well if you were so contented
And I expressly am forbid to touch it
For it engenders choler planteth anger
Since of ourselves ourselves are choleric
Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber        Exeunt
NATHANIEL Peter didst ever see the like
PETER He kills her in her own humour
GRUMIO Where is he
CURTIS In her chamber Making a sermon of continency to her
And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul
Knows not which way to stand to look to speak
And sits as one new risen from a dream
Away away for he is coming hither                  Exeunt
PETRUCHIO Thus have I politicly begun my reign
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty
For then she never looks upon her lure
Another way I have to man my haggard
That is to watch her as we watch these kites
That bate and beat and will not be obedient
As with the meat some undeserved fault
This way the coverlet another way the sheets
Ay and amid this hurly I intend
And in conclusion she shall watch all night
And with the clamour keep her still awake
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness
He that knows better how to tame a shrew
SCENE II
Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO as LICIO
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio
I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand
HORTENSIO Sir to satisfy you in what I have said
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
LUCENTIO Now mistress profit you in what you read
BIANCA What master read you First resolve me that
BIANCA And may you prove sir master of your art
LUCENTIO While you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart
HORTENSIO Quick proceeders marry Now tell me I pray
You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca
TRANIO O despiteful love unconstant womankind
I tell thee Licio this is wonderful
HORTENSIO Mistake no more I am not Licio
Nor a musician as I seem to be
But one that scorn to live in this disguise
For such a one as leaves a gentleman
And makes a god of such a cullion
TRANIO Signior Hortensio I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
I will with you if you be so contented
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever
HORTENSIO See how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio
Here is my hand and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her more but do forswear her
As one unworthy all the former favours
TRANIO And here I take the like unfeigned oath
Never to marry with her though she would entreat
Fie on her See how beastly she doth court him
HORTENSIO Would all the world but he had quite forsworn
For me that I may surely keep mine oath
I will be married to a wealtlly widow
And so farewell Signior Lucentio
Kindness in women not their beauteous looks
Shall win my love and so I take my leave
In resolution as I swore before                        Exit
TRANIO Mistress Bianca bless you with such grace
And have forsworn you with Hortensio
BIANCA Tranio you jest but have you both forsworn me
TRANIO Mistress we have
LUCENTIO Then we are rid of Licio
BIANCA God give him joy
BIANCA He says so Tranio
TRANIO Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
Enter BIONDELLO
An ancient angel coming down the hill
Will serve the turn
TRANIO What is he Biondello
BIONDELLO Master a mercatante or a pedant
I know not what but formal in apparel
In gait and countenance surely like a father
LUCENTIO And what of him Tranio
TRANIO If he be credulous and trust my tale
And give assurance to Baptista Minola
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love and then let me alone
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Enter a PEDANT
PEDANT God save you sir
TRANIO And you sir you are welcome
Travel you far on or are you at the farthest
PEDANT Sir at the farthest for a week or two
But then up farther and as far as Rome
And so to Tripoli if God lend me life
TRANIO What countryman I pray
PEDANT Of Mantua
TRANIO Of Mantua sir Marry God forbid
And come to Padua careless of your life
PEDANT My life sir How I pray For that goes hard
To come to Padua Know you not the cause
PEDANT Alas sir it is worse for me than so
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them
TRANIO Well sir to do you courtesy
First tell me have you ever been at Pisa
PEDANT Ay sir in Pisa have I often been
Pisa renowned for grave citizens
TRANIO Among them know you one Vincentio
PEDANT I know him not but I have heard of him
A merchant of incomparable wealth
TRANIO He is my father sir and sooth to say
one
TRANIO To save your life in this extremity
This favour will I do you for his sake
And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio
His name and credit shall you undertake
Look that you take upon you as you should
You understand me sir So shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city
PEDANT O sir I do and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty
TRANIO Then go with me to make the matter good
This by the way I let you understand
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you              Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter KATHERINA and GRUMIO
GRUMIO No no forsooth I dare not for my life
KATHERINA The more my wrong the more his spite appears
What did he marry me to famish me
Upon entreaty have a present alms
If not elsewhere they meet with charity
But I who never knew how to entreat
Nor never needed that I should entreat
With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed
He does it under name of perfect love
As who should say if I should sleep or eat
I prithee go and get me some repast
I care not what so it be wholesome food
GRUMIO I fear it is too choleric a meat
KATHERINA I like it well good Grumio fetch it me
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard
KATHERINA A dish that I do love to feed upon
GRUMIO Ay but the mustard is too hot a little
KATHERINA Why then the beef and let the mustard rest
GRUMIO Nay then I will not you shall have the mustard
Or else you get no beef of Grumio
KATHERINA Then both or one or anything thou wilt
GRUMIO Why then the mustard without the beef
KATHERINA Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave
Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
That triumph thus upon my misery
Go get thee gone I say
Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat
PETRUCHIO How fares my Kate What sweeting all amort
HORTENSIO Mistress what cheer
KATHERINA Faith as cold as can be
PETRUCHIO Pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
Here love thou seest how diligent I am
To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee
I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks
And all my pains is sorted to no proof
Here take away this dish
KATHERINA I pray you let it stand
PETRUCHIO The poorest service is repaid with thanks
And so shall mine before you touch the meat
KATHERINA I thank you sir
HORTENSIO Signior Petruchio fie you are to blame
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart
Kate eat apace And now my honey love
And revel it as bravely as the best
With silken coats and caps and golden rings
With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure
Enter TAILOR
Come tailor let us see these ornaments
Lay forth the gown
Enter HABERDASHER
What news with you sir
HABERDASHER Here is the cap your worship did bespeak
PETRUCHIO Why this was moulded on a porringer
Away with it Come let me have a bigger
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
PETRUCHIO When you are gentle you shall have one too
And not till then
KATHERINA Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak
And speak I will I am no child no babe
And if you cannot best you stop your ears
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart
Or else my heart concealing it will break
And rather than it shall I will be free
Even to the uttermost as I please in words
KATHERINA Love me or love me not I like the cap
And it I will have or I will have none    Exit HABERDASHER
O mercy God what masquing stuff is here
TAILOR You bid me make it orderly and well
According to the fashion and the time
I did not bid you mar it to the time
Go hop me over every kennel home
For you shall hop without my custom sir
More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me
PETRUCHIO Why true he means to make a puppet of thee
TAILOR She says your worship means to make a puppet of her
PETRUCHIO O monstrous arrogance Thou liest thou thread thou
thimble
Away thou rag thou quantity thou remnant
Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
Just as my master had direction
Grumio gave order how it should be done
GRUMIO I gave him no order I gave him the stuff
TAILOR But how did you desire it should be made
GRUMIO Marry sir with needle and thread
TAILOR But did you not request to have it cut
TAILOR I have
master cut out the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces
Ergo thou liest
TAILOR Why here is the note of the fashion to testify
PETRUCHIO Read it
skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread I
said a gown
PETRUCHIO Proceed
GRUMIO I confess the cape
GRUMIO I confess two sleeves
prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble
TAILOR This is true that I say an I had thee in place where thou
shouldst know it
GRUMIO I am for thee straight take thou the bill give me thy
meteyard and spare not me
PETRUCHIO Well sir in brief the gown is not for me
GRUMIO O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for
O fie fie fie
Go take it hence be gone and say no more
Take no unkindness of his hasty words
Away I say commend me to thy master           Exit TAILOR
Even in these honest mean habiliments
Our purses shall be proud our garments poor
And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds
So honour peereth in the meanest habit
What is the jay more precious than the lark
Because his feathers are more beautiful
Or is the adder better than the eel
Because his painted skin contents the eye
O no good Kate neither art thou the worse
For this poor furniture and mean array
And therefore frolic we will hence forthwith
Go call my men and let us straight to him
There will we mount and thither walk on foot
PETRUCHIO It shall be seven ere I go to horse
Look what I speak or do or think to do
HORTENSIO Why so this gallant will command the sun
Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter TRANIO as LUCENTIO and the PEDANT dressed like VINCENTIO
TRANIO Sir this is the house please it you that I call
PEDANT Ay what else And but I be deceived
Signior Baptista may remember me
Near twenty years ago in Genoa
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus
With such austerity as longeth to a father
Enter BIONDELLO
PEDANT I warrant you But sir here comes your boy
TRANIO Fear you not him Sirrah Biondello
Now do your duty throughly I advise you
BIONDELLO Tut fear not me
TRANIO But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista
BIONDELLO I told him that your father was at Venice
Here comes Baptista Set your countenance sir
Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO as CAMBIO
Signior Baptista you are happily met
I pray you stand good father to me now
Give me Bianca for my patrimony
PEDANT Soft son
Sir by your leave having come to Padua
To gather in some debts my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself
And for the love he beareth to your daughter
No worse than I upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
For curious I cannot be with you
Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well
BAPTISTA Sir pardon me in what I have to say
Your plainness and your shortness please me well
Right true it is your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him
Or both dissemble deeply their affections
And therefore if you say no more than this
That like a father you will deal with him
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower
Your son shall have my daughter with consent
TRANIO I thank you sir Where then do you know best
BAPTISTA Not in my house Lucentio for you know
Pitchers have ears and I have many servants
And happily we might be interrupted
TRANIO Then at my lodging an it like you
There doth my father lie and there this night
Send for your daughter by your servant here
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently
The worst is this that at so slender warning
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance
BAPTISTA It likes me well Cambio hie you home
And bid Bianca make her ready straight
BIONDELLO I pray the gods she may with all my heart
TRANIO Dally not with the gods but get thee gone
Exit BIONDELLO
Signior Baptista shall I lead the way
Welcome One mess is like to be your cheer
Come sir we will better it in Pisa
BAPTISTA I follow you                                 Exeunt
BIONDELLO Cambio
BIONDELLO You saw my master wink and laugh upon you
LUCENTIO Biondello what of that
BIONDELLO Faith nothing but has left me here behind to expound
the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens
LUCENTIO I pray thee moralize them
BIONDELLO Then thus Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving
father of a deceitful son
LUCENTIO And what of him
BIONDELLO His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper
LUCENTIO And then
at all hours
LUCENTIO And what of all this
BIONDELLO I cannot tell except they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance Take your assurance of her cum privilegio
some sufficient honest witnesses
If this be not that you look for I have more to say
But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day
BIONDELLO I cannot tarry I knew a wench married in an afternoon
as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so
may you sir and so adieu sir My master hath appointed me to
come with your appendix
Exit
LUCENTIO I may and will if she be so contented
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her              Exit
SCENE V
A public road
Enter PETRUCHIO KATHERINA HORTENSIO and SERVANTS
Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon
KATHERINA The moon The sun It is not moonlight now
PETRUCHIO I say it is the moon that shines so bright
KATHERINA I know it is the sun that shines so bright
It shall be moon or star or what I list
Go on and fetch our horses back again
HORTENSIO Say as he says or we shall never go
KATHERINA Forward I pray since we have come so far
And be it moon or sun or what you please
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me
PETRUCHIO I say it is the moon
KATHERINA I know it is the moon
PETRUCHIO Nay then you lie it is the blessed sun
But sun it is not when you say it is not
And the moon changes even as your mind
And so it shall be so for Katherine
HORTENSIO Petruchio go thy ways the field is won
PETRUCHIO Well forward forward thus the bowl should run
And not unluckily against the bias
But soft Company is coming here
Enter VINCENTIO
Tell me sweet Kate and tell me truly too
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman
Such war of white and red within her cheeks
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
As those two eyes become that heavenly face
Fair lovely maid once more good day to thee
KATHERINA Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet
Whither away or where is thy abode
Happy the parents of so fair a child
Happier the man whom favourable stars
PETRUCHIO Why how now Kate I hope thou art not mad
This is a man old wrinkled faded withered
And not a maiden as thou sayst he is
KATHERINA Pardon old father my mistaking eyes
That have been so bedazzled with the sun
That everything I look on seemeth green
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father
Pardon I pray thee for my mad mistaking
PETRUCHIO Do good old grandsire and withal make known
We shall be joyful of thy company
VINCENTIO Fair sir and you my merry mistress
And bound I am to Padua there to visit
A son of mine which long I have not seen
PETRUCHIO What is his name
VINCENTIO Lucentio gentle sir
PETRUCHIO Happily met the happier for thy son
And now by law as well as reverend age
I may entitle thee my loving father
The sister to my wife this gentlewoman
Thy son by this hath married Wonder not
Her dowry wealthy and of worthy birth
Beside so qualified as may beseem
The spouse of any noble gentleman
Let me embrace with old Vincentio
And wander we to see thy honest son
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous
VINCENTIO But is this true or is it else your pleasure
Like pleasant travellers to break a jest
Upon the company you overtake
HORTENSIO I do assure thee father so it is
PETRUCHIO Come go along and see the truth hereof
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous
Exeunt all but HORTENSIO
HORTENSIO Well Petruchio this has put me in heart
Have to my widow and if she be froward
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward         Exit

PETRUCHIO KATHERINA HORTENSIO and WIDOW The SERVINGMEN with TRANIO

BAPTISTA Now in good sadness son Petruchio

PETRUCHIO O ho entreat her

HORTENSIO I am afraid sir
Do what you can yours will not be entreated
BIONDELLO She says you have some goodly jest in hand
She will not come she bids you come to her
PETRUCHIO Worse and worse she will not come O vile
Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress
Say I command her come to me                    Exit GRUMIO
HORTENSIO I know her answer
PETRUCHIO What
HORTENSIO She will not
PETRUCHIO The fouler fortune mine and there an end
BAPTISTA Now by my holidame here comes Katherina
KATHERINA What is your sir that you send for me
KATHERINA They sit conferring by the parlour fire
PETRUCHIO Go fetch them hither if they deny to come
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands
Away I say and bring them hither straight
Exit KATHERINA
LUCENTIO Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
HORTENSIO And so it is I wonder what it bodes
PETRUCHIO Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
An awful rule and right supremacy
BAPTISTA Now fair befall thee good Petruchio
The wager thou hast won and I will ad
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
Another dowry to another daughter
PETRUCHIO Nay I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of her obedience
See where she comes and brings your froward wives
As prisoners to her womanly persuasion
Katherine that cap of yours becomes you not
Off with that bauble throw it underfoot
WIDOW Lord let me never have a cause to sigh
Till I be brought to such a silly pass
BIANCA Fie what a foolish duty call you this
LUCENTIO I would your duty were as foolish too
The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca
BIANCA The more fool you for laying on my duty
PETRUCHIO Katherine I charge thee tell these headstrong women
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands
PETRUCHIO Come on I say and first begin with her
WIDOW She shall not
PETRUCHIO I say she shall And first begin with her
KATHERINA Fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes
To wound thy lord thy king thy governor
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
And in no sense is meet or amiable
And while it is so none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
And for thy maintenance commits his body
To painful labour both by sea and land
To watch the night in storms the day in cold
Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
Too little payment for so great a debt
Such duty as the subject owes the prince
Even such a woman oweth to her husband
And when she is froward peevish sullen sour
And not obedient to his honest will
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord
To offer war where they should kneel for peace
Or seek for rule supremacy and sway
When they are bound to serve love and obey
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
Unapt to toll and trouble in the world
But that our soft conditions and our hearts
Should well agree with our external parts
Come come you froward and unable worins
My mind hath been as big as one of yours
My heart as great my reason haply more
To bandy word for word and frown for frown
But now I see our lances are but straws
Our strength as weak our weakness past compare
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are
Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
In token of which duty if he please
My hand is ready may it do him ease
LUCENTIO But a harsh hearing when women are froward
We three are married but you two are sped
And being a winner God give you good night
Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHERINA
Exeunt

SCENE 2
Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA
MIRANDA If by your art my dearest father you have
Put the wild waters in this roar allay them
The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
Dashes the fire out O I have suffered
With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel
Who had no doubt some noble creature in her
Had I been any god of power I would
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
The fraughting souls within her
PROSPERO Be conected
No more amazement tell your piteous heart
MIRANDA O woe the day
PROSPERO No harm
I have done nothing but in care of thee
Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
Of whence I am nor that I am more better
Than Prospero master of a full poor cell
And thy no greater father
MIRANDA More to know
Did never meddle with my thoughts
I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand
And pluck my magic garment from me So
Lie there my art Wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
The very virtue of compassion in thee
I have with such provision in mine art
No not so much perdition as an hair
Betid to any creature in the vessel
Sit down for thou must now know farther
MIRANDA You have often
And left me to a bootless inquisition
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear
Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember
A time before we came unto this cell
I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
Out three years old
MIRANDA Certainly sir I can
PROSPERO By what By any other house or person
Of any thing the image tell me that
Hath kept with thy remembrance
And rather like a dream than an assurance
That my remembrance warrants Had I not
Four or five women once that tended me
PROSPERO Thou hadst and more Miranda But how is it
That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else
In the dark backward and abysm of time
MIRANDA But that I do not
PROSPERO Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
A prince of power
MIRANDA Sir are not you my father
PROSPERO Thy mother was a piece of virtue and
She said thou wast my daughter and thy father
Was Duke of Milan and his only heir
And princess no worse issued
MIRANDA O the heavens
What foul play had we that we came from thence
PROSPERO Both both my girl
But blessedly holp hither
MIRANDA O my heart bleeds
Which is from my remembrance Please you farther
I pray thee mark me that a brother should
Be so perfidious He whom next thyself
The manage of my state as at that time
Through all the signories it was the first
And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed
In dignity and for the liberal arts
The government I cast upon my brother
And to my state grew stranger being transported
Dost thou attend me
MIRANDA Sir most heedfully
PROSPERO Being once perfected how to grant suits
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk
MIRANDA O good sir I do
PROSPERO I pray thee mark me
I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
To closeness and the bettering of my mind
Like a good parent did beget of him
A falsehood in its contrary as great
As my trust was which had indeed no limit
A confidence sans bound He being thus lorded
Not only with what my revenue yielded
But what my power might else exact like one
Who having into truth by telling of it
Made such a sinner of his memory
Dost thou hear
MIRANDA Your tale sir would cure deafness
He thinks me now incapable confederates
To give him annual tribute do him homage
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
To most ignoble stooping
MIRANDA O the heavens
If this might be a brother
MIRANDA I should sin
To think but nobly of my grandmother
Good wombs have borne bad sons
PROSPERO Now the condition
This King of Naples being an enemy
Of homage and I know not how much tribute
Should presently extirpate me and mine
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
With all the honours on my brother Whereon
A treacherous army levied one midnight
Me and thy crying self
MIRANDA Alack for pity
PROSPERO Hear a little further
Were most impertinent
MIRANDA Wherefore did they not
That hour destroy us
PROSPERO Well demanded wench
My tale provokes that question Dear they durst not
So dear the love my people bore me nor set
A mark so bloody on the business but
With colours fairer painted their foul ends
In few they hurried us aboard a bark
Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
Instinctively have quit it There they hoist us
Did us but loving wrong
MIRANDA Alack what trouble
Was I then to you
PROSPERO O a cherubin
Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile
Infused with a fortitude from heaven
An undergoing stomach to bear up
Against what should ensue
MIRANDA How came we ashore
PROSPERO By Providence divine
Some food we had and some fresh water that
A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo
Out of his charity who being then appointed
Master of this design did give us with
Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
Which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
From mine own library with volumes that
I prize above my dukedom
MIRANDA Would I might
But ever see that man
Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful
sir
PROSPERO Know thus far forth
By accident most strange bountiful Fortune
Now my dear lady hath mine enemies
Brought to this shore and by my prescience
I find my zenith doth depend upon
A most auspicious star whose influence
If now I court not but omit my fortunes
Will ever after droop Here cease more questions
And give it way I know thou canst not choose
Come away servant come I am ready now
Approach my Ariel Come
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL All hail great master grave sir hail I come
To swim to dive into the fire to ride
Ariel and all his quality
PROSPERO Hast thou spirit
ARIEL To every article
Now in the waist the deck in every cabin
And burn in many places on the topmast
The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
Yea his dread trident shake
PROSPERO My brave spirit
Who was so firm so constant that this coil
Would not infect his reason
ARIEL Not a soul
Some tricks of desperation All but mariners
But was not this nigh shore
ARIEL Close by my master
PROSPERO But are they Ariel safe
On their sustaining garments not a blemish
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting
His arms in this sad knot
ARIEL Safely in harbour
The mariners all under hatches stowed
And are upon the Mediterranean flote
Bound sadly home for Naples
And his great person perish
PROSPERO Ariel thy charge
ARIEL Past the mid season
Must by us both be spent most preciously
ARIEL Is there more toil Since thou dost give me pains
PROSPERO How now moody
ARIEL My liberty
PROSPERO Before the time be out No more
ARIEL I prithee
Remember I have done thee worthy service
Without or grudge or grumblings Thou didst promise
To bate me a full year
PROSPERO Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee
ARIEL No
Of the salt deep
To run upon the sharp wind of the north
ARIEL I do not sir
PROSPERO Thou liest malignant thing Hast thou forgot
The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy
Was grown into a hoop Hast thou forgot her
ARIEL No sir
PROSPERO Thou hast Where was she born
Speak tell me
ARIEL Sir in Argier
PROSPERO O was she so I must
Once in a month recount what thou hast been
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
To enter human hearing from Argier
They would not take her life Is not this true
ARIEL Ay sir
And for thou wast a spirit too delicate
Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
By help of her more potent ministers
And in her most unmitigable rage
Into a cloven pine within which rift
A dozen years within which space she died
And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
Save for the son that she did litter here
A human shape
ARIEL Yes Caliban her son
PROSPERO Dull thing I say so he that Caliban
What torment I did find thee in thy groans
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
Could not again undo It was mine art
The pine and let thee out
ARIEL I thank thee master
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
ARIEL Pardon master
I will be correspondent to command
And do my spriting gently
PROSPERO Do so and after two days
I will discharge thee
What shall I do Say what What shall I do
To no sight but thine and mine invisible
To every eyeball else Go take this shape
Exit ARIEL
Awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well
Awake
MIRANDA The strangeness of your story put
Heaviness in me
PROSPERO Shake it off Come on
Yields us kind answer
I do not love to look on
We cannot miss him he does make our fire
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
That profit us What ho slave Caliban
Thou earth thou Speak
Come thou tortoise when
Fine apparition My quaint Ariel
Hark in thine ear
ARIEL My lord it shall be done                         Exit
PROSPERO Thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
Upon thy wicked dam come forth
Enter CALIBAN
Shall for that vast of night that they may work
As thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
CALIBAN I must eat my dinner
To name the bigger light and how the less
Of Sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
For I am all the subjects that you have
Which first was mine own king and here you sty me
In this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
PROSPERO Thou most lying slave
In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
The honour of my child
This isle with Calibans
MIRANDA Abhorred slave
Which any print of goodness wilt not take
Being capable of all ill I pitied thee
Took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
One thing or other When thou didst not savage
Know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
With words that made them known But thy vile race
Could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
Is I know how to curse The red plague rid you
For learning me your language
Fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
That beasts shall tremble at thy din
CALIBAN No pray thee
And make a vassal of him
PROSPERO So slave hence                       Exit CALIBAN
FERDINAND following
Come unto these yellow sands
And then take hands
The wild waves whist
Foot it featly here and there
And sweet sprites the burden bear
Hark hark
The watch dogs bark
Hark hark I hear
The strain of strutting chanticleer
earth
It sounds no more and sure it waits upon
This music crept by me upon the waters
Allaying both their fury and my passion
No it begins again
Full fathom five thy father lies
Of his bones are coral made
Those are pearls that were his eyes
Nothing of him that doth fade
Into something rich and strange
This is no mortal business nor no sound
That the earth owes I hear it now above me
PROSPERO The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
And say what thou seest yond
Lord how it looks about Believe me sir
PROSPERO No wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
As we have such This gallant which thou seest
A goodly person He hath lost his fellows
MIRANDA I might call him
A thing divine for nothing natural
I ever saw so noble
Within two days for this
FERDINAND Most sure the goddess
May know if you remain upon this island
And that you will some good instruction give
How I may bear me here My prime request
Which I do last pronounce is O you wonder
If you be maid or no
MIRANDA No wonder sir
But certainly a maid
FERDINAND My language Heavens
I am the best of them that speak this speech
PROSPERO How the best
What wert thou if the King of Naples heard thee
FERDINAND A single thing as I am now that wonders
To hear thee speak of Naples He does hear me
And that he does I weep Myself am Naples
Who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
MIRANDA Alack for mercy
FERDINAND Yes faith and all his lords the Duke of Milan
And his brave son being twain
And his more braver daughter could control thee
sir
I fear you have done yourself some wrong a word
MIRANDA Why speaks my father so ungently This
FERDINAND O if a virgin
The Queen of Naples
PROSPERO Soft Sir one word more
busines
I must uneasy make lest too light winning
charge thee
That thou attend me thou dost here usurp
Upon this island as a spy to win it
FERDINAND No as I am a man
If the ill spirit have so fair a house
PROSPERO Follow me
Wherein the acorn cradled Follow
FERDINAND No
I will resist such entertainment till
Mine enemy has more power
MIRANDA O dear father
Make not too rash a trial of him for
PROSPERO What I say
My foot my tutor Put thy sword up traitor
For I can here disarm thee with this stick
And make thy weapon drop
MIRANDA Beseech you father
PROSPERO Hence Hang not on my garments
MIRANDA Sir have pity
PROSPERO Silence One word more
Shall make me chide thee if not hate thee What
An advocate for an impostor hush
Having seen but him and Caliban Foolish wench
And they to him are angels
MIRANDA My affections
Are then most humble I have no ambition
To see a goodlier man
PROSPERO Come on obey
Thy nerves are in their infancy again
And have no vigour in them
FERDINAND So they are
My spirits as in a dream are all bound up
Might I but through my prison once a day
Let liberty make use of space enough
Have I in such a prison
MIRANDA Be of comfort
Than he appears by speech this is unwonted
Which now came from him
As mountain winds but then exactly do
All points of my command
Speak not for him                                    Exeunt

ACT II SCENE 1
Another part of the island
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and OTHERS
GONZALO Beseech you sir be merry you have cause
So have we all of joy for our escape
Is much beyond our loss Our hint of woe
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
I mean our preservation few in millions
Can speak like us Then wisely good sir weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort
ALONSO Prithee peace
SEBASTIAN He receives comfort like cold porridge
and by it will strike
SEBASTIAN A dollar
GONZALO Dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken
SEBASTIAN You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
should
ANTONIO Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
ALONSO I prithee spare
SEBASTIAN He will be talking
ANTONIO Which of he or Adrian for a good wager first
begins to crow
SEBASTIAN The old cock
SEBASTIAN Done The wager
ANTONIO A laughter
SEBASTIAN A match
ANTONIO Ha ha ha
ADRIAN It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
temperance
ANTONIO Temperance was a delicate wench
SEBASTIAN Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly
ADRIAN The air breathes upon us here most sweetly
SEBASTIAN As if it had lungs and rotten ones
GONZALO Here is everything advantageous to life
ANTONIO True save means to live
GONZALO How lush and lusty the grass looks how green
ANTONIO The ground indeed is tawny
ANTONIO He misses not much
SEBASTIAN No he doth but mistake the truth totally
GONZALO But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost
in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
water
ANTONIO If but one of his pockets could speak would it
not say he lies
SEBASTIAN Ay or very falsely pocket up his report
GONZALO Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the
our return
to their queen
in Widow Dido
Good Lord how you take it
that She was of Carthage not of Tunis
GONZALO This Tunis sir was Carthage
ADRIAN Carthage
GONZALO I assure you Carthage
ANTONIO His word is more than the miraculous harp
ANTONIO What impossible matter will he make easy next
SEBASTIAN I think he will carry this island home in his
pocket and give it his son for an apple
ANTONIO And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
forth more islands
GONZALO Ay
ANTONIO Why in good time
GONZALO Sir we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of
your daughter who is now Queen
SEBASTIAN Bate I beseech you widow Dido
ANTONIO O widow Dido Ay widow Dido
GONZALO Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I
wore it I mean in a sort
ALONSO You cram these words into mine ears against
The stomach of my sense Would I had never
Married my daughter there for coming thence
My son is lost and in my rate she too
Who is so far from Italy removed
Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish
Hath made his meal on thee
FRANCISCO Sir he may live
I saw him beat the surges under him
And ride upon their backs he trod the water
Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
The surge most swoln that met him his bold head
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
As stooping to relieve him I not doubt
He came alive to land
SEBASTIAN Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter
But rather lose her to an African
ALONSO Prithee peace
By all of us and the fair soul herself
I fear for ever Milan and Naples have
Than we bring men to comfort them
GONZALO My lord Sebastian
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
And time to speak it in you rub the sore
When you should bring the plaster
SEBASTIAN Very well
ANTONIO And most chirurgeonly
GONZALO It is foul weather in us all good sir
When you are cloudy
SEBASTIAN Foul weather
ANTONIO Very foul
SEBASTIAN Or docks or mallows
SEBASTIAN Scape being drunk for want of wine
Execute all things for no kind of traffic
Would I admit no name of magistrate
Letters should not be known riches poverty
And use of service none contract succession
Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
No use of metal corn or wine or oil
No occupation all men idle all
And women too but innocent and pure
ANTONIO The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning
GONZALO All things in common nature should produce
Without sweat or endeavour Treason felony
Sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
Would I not have but nature should bring forth
Of it own kind all foison all abundance
To feed my innocent people
ANTONIO None man all idle whores and knaves
GONZALO I would with such perfection govern sir
SEBASTIAN Save his Majesty
ANTONIO Long live Gonzalo
ALONSO Prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me
GONZALO I do well believe your Highness and did it to
minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such
sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh
at nothing
GONZALO Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to
you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still
ANTONIO What a blow was there given
GONZALO You are gentlemen of brave mettle you would
lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing
Enter ARIEL invisible playing solemn music
ANTONIO Nay good my lord be not angry
GONZALO No I warrant you I will not adventure my
discretion so weakly Will you laugh me asleep for I am
very heavy
ANTONIO Go sleep and hear us
ALONSO What all so soon asleep I wish mine eyes
Would with themselves shut up my thoughts I find
SEBASTIAN Please you sir
Do not omit the heavy offer of it
It seldom visits sorrow when it doth
It is a comforter
ANTONIO We two my lord
Will guard your person while you take your rest
And watch your safety
SEBASTIAN What a strange drowsiness possesses them
SEBASTIAN Why
Doth it not then our eyelids sink I find not
ANTONIO Nor I my spirits are nimble
They fell together all as by consent
Worthy Sebastian O what might No more
And yet methinks I see it in thy face
My strong imagination sees a crown
Dropping upon thy head
SEBASTIAN What art thou waking
ANTONIO Do you not hear me speak
SEBASTIAN I do and surely
Out of thy sleep What is it thou didst say
This is a strange repose to be asleep
With eyes wide open standing speaking moving
And yet so fast asleep
ANTONIO Noble Sebastian
Whiles thou art waking
SEBASTIAN Thou dost snore distinctly
ANTONIO I am more serious than my custom you
Must be so too if heed me which to do
SEBASTIAN Well I am standing water
SEBASTIAN Do so to ebb
Hereditary sloth instructs me
ANTONIO O
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it
You more invest it Ebbing men indeed
Most often do so near the bottom run
By their own fear or sloth
SEBASTIAN Prithee say on
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
A matter from thee and a birth indeed
Which throes thee much to yield
ANTONIO Thus sir
Although this lord of weak remembrance this
Who shall be of as little memory
As he that sleeps here swims
SEBASTIAN I have no hope
What great hope have you No hope that way is
Another way so high a hope that even
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond
But doubt discovery there Will you grant with me
ANTONIO Then tell me
SEBASTIAN Claribel
ANTONIO She that is Queen of Tunis she that dwells
Can have no note unless the sun were post
Be rough and razorable she that from whom
And by that destiny to perform an act
In yours and my discharge
SEBASTIAN What stuff is this How say you
There is some space
Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis
Than now they are There be that can rule Naples
As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate
As amply and unnecessarily
As this Gonzalo I myself could make
A chough of as deep chat O that you bore
The mind that I do What a sleep were this
For your advancement Do you understand me
SEBASTIAN Methinks I do
ANTONIO And how does your content
Tender your own good fortune
SEBASTIAN I remember
You did supplant your brother Prospero
ANTONIO True
And look how well my garments sit upon me
Were then my fellows now they are my men
This deity in my bosom twenty consciences
And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother
No better than the earth he lies upon
Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it
Can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus
To the perpetual wink for aye might put
This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who
Should not upbraid our course For all the rest
We say befits the hour
SEBASTIAN Thy case dear friend
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest
And I the King shall love thee
ANTONIO Draw together
And when I rear my hand do you the like
To fall it on Gonzalo
ARIEL My master through his art foresees the danger
While you here do snoring lie
His time doth take
If of life you keep a care
Shake off slumber and beware
Awake awake
ANTONIO Then let us both be sudden
GONZALO Now good angels
Wherefore this ghastly looking
SEBASTIAN Whiles we stood here securing your repose
Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
It struck mine ear most terribly
ALONSO I heard nothing
To make an earthquake Sure it was the roar
Of a whole herd of lions
ALONSO Heard you this Gonzalo
GONZALO Upon mine honour sir I heard a humming
And that a strange one too which did awake me
search
For my poor son
GONZALO Heavens keep him from these beasts
ALONSO Lead away
ARIEL Prospero my lord shall know what I have done
So King go safely on to seek thy son               Exeunt
SCENE 2
Another part of the island
Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood A noise of thunder heard
CALIBAN All the infections that the sun sucks up
From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him
Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark
For every trifle are they set upon me
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
And after bite me then like hedgehogs which
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
Their pricks at my footfall sometime am I
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
Do hiss me into madness
Enter TRINCULO
Lo now lo
Here comes a spirit of his and to torment me
Perchance he will not mind me
weather at all and another storm brewing I hear it
looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor If
it should thunder as it did before I know not where to
hide my head Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by
pailfuls What have we here a man or a fish dead or
alive A fish he smells like a fish a very ancient and
strange fish Were I in England now as once I was and
had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but
would give a piece of silver There would this monster
make a man any strange beast there makes a man when
they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they
let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no
fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by

other shelter hereabout Misery acquaints a man with

Then to sea boys and let her go hang
CALIBAN Do not torment me O

went on four legs cannot make him give ground and it
shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at
nostrils
CALIBAN The spirit torments me O
STEPHANO This is some monster of the isle with four legs
who hath got as I take it an ague Where the devil
should he learn our language I will give him some
relief if it be but for that If I can recover him and
leather
home faster

drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit If
I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take
too much for him he shall pay for him that hath him

STEPHANO Come on your ways open your mouth here is
that which will give language to you cat Open your
mouth this will shake your shaking I can tell you and
your chaps again
STEPHANO Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
friend his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and
to detract If all the wine in my bottle will recover
in thy other mouth
TRINCULO Stephano
STEPHANO Doth thy other mouth call me Mercy mercy
This is a devil and no monster I will leave him I
have no long spoon
TRINCULO Stephano If thou beest Stephano touch me and

goose
TRINCULO O Stephano hast any more of this
STEPHANO The whole butt man my cellar is in a rock by
How does thine ague
CALIBAN I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee My
STEPHANO Come swear to that kiss the book I will

TRINCULO By this good light this is a very shallow
monster
Moon A most poor credulous monster Well drawn

A plague upon the tyrant that I serve
Thou wondrous man
TRINCULO A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of
a poor drunkard

ACT III SCENE 1
Enter FERDINAND hearing a log
FERDINAND There be some sports are painful and their
labour
Delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
Point to rich ends This my mean task
Would be as heavy to me as odious but
And makes my labours pleasures O she is
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up
Upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress
Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness
Had never like executor I forget
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
Most busy least when I do it
Enter MIRANDA and PROSPERO at a distance unseen
MIRANDA Alas now pray you
Work not so hard I would the lightning had
Pray set it down and rest you when this burns
Is hard at study pray now rest yourself
FERDINAND O most dear mistress
The sun will set before I shall discharge
What I must strive to do
FERDINAND No precious creature
I had rather crack my sinews break my back
Than you should such dishonour undergo
While I sit lazy by
MIRANDA It would become me
As well as it does you and I should do it
With much more ease for my good will is to it
And yours it is against
This visitation shows it
MIRANDA You look wearily
When you are by at night I do beseech you
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers
What is your name
I have broke your hest to say so
Brought my too diligent ear for several virtues
With so full soul but some defect in her
And put it to the foil but you O you
So perfect and so peerless are created
MIRANDA I do not know
Save from my glass mine own nor have I seen
More that I may call men than you good friend
And my dear father How features are abroad
I am skilless of but by my modesty
The jewel in my dower I would not wish
Any companion in the world but you
Nor can imagination form a shape
Besides yourself to like of But I prattle
I therein do forget
FERDINAND I am in my condition
This wooden slavery than to suffer
The very instant that I saw you did
My heart fly to your service there resides
To make me slave to it and for your sake
MIRANDA Do you love me
FERDINAND O heaven O earth bear witness to this sound
And crown what I profess with kind event
If I speak true If hollowly invert
What best is boded me to mischief I
Do love prize honour you
MIRANDA I am a fool
To weep at what I am glad of
Of two most rare affections Heavens rain grace
FERDINAND Wherefore weep you
MIRANDA At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
What I desire to give and much less take
What I shall die to want But this is trifling
And all the more it seeks to hide itself
The bigger bulk it shows Hence bashful cunning
And prompt me plain and holy innocence
I am your wife if you will marry me
Whether you will or no
FERDINAND My mistress dearest
And I thus humble ever
MIRANDA My husband then
FERDINAND Ay with a heart as willing
Till half an hour hence
FERDINAND A thousand thousand
Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally
PROSPERO So glad of this as they I cannot be
For yet ere supper time must I perform
Much business appertaining                             Exit
SCENE 2
Another part of the island
Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO
water not a drop before therefore bear up and board
totters
eyes are almost set in thy head
TRINCULO Where should they be set else He were a brave
monster indeed if they were set in his tail
sack For my part the sea cannot drown me I swam ere
I could recover the shore five and thirty leagues off
and on By this light thou shalt be my lieutenant
monster or my standard
yet say nothing neither
CALIBAN How does thy honour Let me lick thy shoe
TRINCULO Thou liest most ignorant monster I am in case
was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack
half fish and half a monster
CALIBAN Lo how he mocks me Wilt thou let him my
lord
a natural
CALIBAN Lo lo again Bite him to death I prithee
STEPHANO Trinculo keep a good tongue in your head if
my subject and he shall not suffer indignity
hearken once again to the suit I made to thee
STEPHANO Marry will I kneel and repeat it I will stand
and so shall Trinculo
Enter ARIEL invisible
CALIBAN As I told thee before I am subject to a tyrant
sorcerer that by his cunning hath cheated me of the
island
ARIEL Thou liest
CALIBAN Thou liest thou jesting monkey thou
I would my valiant master would destroy thee
I do not lie
by this hand I will supplant some of your teeth
TRINCULO Why I said nothing
STEPHANO Mum then and no more Proceed
CALIBAN I say by sorcery he got this isle
From me he got it If thy greatness will
bring me to the party
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head
ARIEL Thou liest thou canst not
I do beseech thy greatness give him blows
Where the quick freshes are
STEPHANO Trinculo run into no further danger interrupt
off
STEPHANO Didst thou not say he lied
ARIEL Thou liest
this give me the lie another time
drinking do A murrain on your monster and the devil
take your fingers
CALIBAN Ha ha ha
further off
him too
STEPHANO Stand farther Come proceed
Batter his skull or paunch him with a stake
Or cut his wezand with thy knife Remember
First to possess his books for without them
One spirit to command they all do hate him
As rootedly as I Burn but his books
And that most deeply to consider is
The beauty of his daughter he himself
Calls her a nonpareil I never saw a woman
But only Sycorax my dam and she
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
STEPHANO Is it so brave a lass
CALIBAN Ay lord she will become thy bed I warrant
And bring thee forth brave brood
STEPHANO Monster I will kill this man his daughter and I
and thyself shall be viceroys Dost thou like the plot
Trinculo
TRINCULO Excellent
STEPHANO Give me thy hand I am sorry I beat thee but
CALIBAN Within this half hour will he be asleep
Wilt thou destroy him then
STEPHANO Ay on mine honour
ARIEL This will I tell my master
Let us be jocund will you troll the catch
STEPHANO At thy request monster I will do reason any
Thought is free
STEPHANO What is this same
picture of Nobody
STEPHANO If thou beest a man show thyself in thy
TRINCULO O forgive me my sins
STEPHANO He that dies pays all debts I defy thee Mercy
upon us
CALIBAN Art thou afeard
STEPHANO No monster not I
CALIBAN Be not afeard The isle is full of noises
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
Will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices
Will make me sleep again and then in dreaming
The clouds methought would open and show riches
I cried to dream again
STEPHANO This will prove a brave kingdom to me where I
shall have my music for nothing
STEPHANO That shall be by and by I remember the story
after do our work
this taborer he lays it on
SCENE 3
Another part of the island
Enter ALONSO SEBASTIAN ANTONIO GONZALO ADRIAN FRANCISCO and OTHERS
I needs must rest me
ALONSO Old lord I cannot blame thee
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
Whom thus we stray to find and the sea mocks
Our frustrate search on land Well let him go
so out of hope
Do not for one repulse forgo the purpose
Will we take throughly
Will not nor cannot use such vigilance
As when they are fresh
Solemn and strange music and PROSPERO on the
top invisible Enter several strange SHAPES
bringing in a banquet and dance about it with
gentle actions of salutations and inviting the
KING etc to eat they depart
ALONSO What harmony is this My good friends hark
GONZALO Marvellous sweet music
ALONSO Give us kind keepers heavens What were these
SEBASTIAN A living drollery Now I will believe
That there are unicorns that in Arabia
And what does else want credit come to me
GONZALO If in Naples
I should report this now would they believe me
If I should say I saw such islanders
For certes these are people of the island
Who though they are of monstrous shape yet note
Our human generation you shall find
Many nay almost any
Thou hast said well for some of you there present
Are worse than devils
ALONSO I cannot too much muse
Such shapes such gesture and such sound expressing
Although they want the use of tongue a kind
Of excellent dumb discourse
SEBASTIAN No matter since
They have left their viands behind for we have stomachs
ALONSO Not I
GONZALO Faith sir you need not fear When we were boys
Who would believe that there were mountaineers
Wallets of flesh or that there were such men
Whose heads stood in their breasts which now we find
Good warrant of
ALONSO I will stand to and feed
Although my last no matter since I feel
The best is past Brother my lord the Duke
Stand to and do as we
Thunder and lightning Enter ARIEL like a harpy
claps his wings upon the table and with a quaint
device the banquet vanishes
ARIEL You are three men of sin whom Destiny
That hath to instrument this lower world
Being most unfit to live I have made you mad
Their proper selves
You fools I and my fellows
Are ministers of Fate the elements
Are like invulnerable If you could hurt
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
From Milan did supplant good Prospero
Him and his innocent child for which foul deed
Against your peace Thee of thy son Alonso
They have bereft and do pronounce by me
Can be at once shall step by step attend
Which here in this most desolate isle else falls
And a clear life ensuing
He vanishes in thunder then to soft music enter
the SHAPES again and dance with mocks and mows
and carrying out the table
PROSPERO Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
In what thou hadst to say so with good life
And observation strange my meaner ministers
Their several kinds have done My high charms work
And these mine enemies are all knit up
And in these fits I leave them while I visit
In this strange stare
ALONSO O it is monstrous monstrous
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it
The winds did sing it to me and the thunder
The name of Prosper it did bass my trespass
And with him there lie mudded                          Exit
SEBASTIAN But one fiend at a time
GONZALO All three of them are desperate their great guilt
Like poison given to work a great time after
Now gins to bite the spirits I do beseech you
That are of suppler joints follow them swiftly
And hinder them from what this ecstasy
May now provoke them to
ADRIAN Follow I pray you                             Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE 1
Enter PROSPERO FERDINAND and MIRANDA
Your compensation makes amends for
Have given you here a third of mine own life
Or that for which I live who once again
I tender to thy hand All thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love and thou
Hast strangely stood the test here afore heaven
I ratify this my rich gift O Ferdinand
Do not smile at me that I boast her off
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her
FERDINAND I do believe it
Against an oracle
PROSPERO Then as my gift and thine own acquisition
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow but barren hate
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both Therefore take heed
FERDINAND As I hope
For quiet days fair issue and long life
Our worser genius can shall never melt
Mine honour into lust to take away
PROSPERO Fairly spoke
Sit then and talk with her she is thine own
What Ariel my industrious servant Ariel
Enter ARIEL
ARIEL What would my potent master Here I am
PROSPERO Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform and I must use you
In such another trick Go bring the rabble
Incite them to quick motion for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art it is my promise
And they expect it from me
ARIEL Presently
PROSPERO Ay with a twink
Each one tripping on his toe
Will be here with mop and mow
Do you love me master No
PROSPERO Dearly my delicate Ariel Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call
ARIEL Well I conceive                                  Exit
PROSPERO Look thou be true do not give dalliance
Too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw
Or else good night your vow
FERDINAND I warrant you sir
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardour of my liver
PROSPERO Well
Now come my Ariel bring a corollary
Rather than want a spirit appear and pertly
Enter IRIS
IRIS Ceres most bounteous lady thy rich leas
Of wheat rye barley vetches oats and pease
Thy turfy mountains where live nibbling sheep
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims
Which spongy April at thy hest betrims
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns and thy broom groves
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves
Bids thee leave these and with her sovereign grace
To come and sport Her peacocks fly amain
Approach rich Ceres her to entertain
Enter CERES
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
IRIS A contract of true love to celebrate
And some donation freely to estate
On the blest lovers
CERES Tell me heavenly bow
If Venus or her son as thou dost know
Do now attend the Queen Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got
I have forsworn
IRIS Of her society
Be not afraid I met her Deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid
Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
CERES Highest Queen of State
Great Juno comes I know her by her gait
JUNO How does my bounteous sister Go with me
To bless this twain that they may prosperous be
Long continuance and increasing
Hourly joys be still upon you
Juno sings her blessings on you
Barns and gamers never empty
Plants with goodly burden bowing
Spring come to you at the farthest
In the very end of harvest
Scarcity and want shall shun you
FERDINAND This is a most majestic vision and
Harmonious charmingly May I be bold
To think these spirits
PROSPERO Spirits which by mine art
My present fancies
FERDINAND Let me live here ever
Makes this place Paradise
PROSPERO Sweet now silence
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
Answer your summons Juno does command
Come temperate nymphs and help to celebrate
A contract of true love be not too late
Enter certain NYMPHS
Come hither from the furrow and be merry
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing
Enter certain REAPERS properly habited they join
with the NYMPHS in a graceful dance towards the
end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly and speaks
after which to a strange hollow and confused
noise they heavily vanish
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life the minute of their plot
more
That works him strongly
MIRANDA Never till this day
Our revels now are ended These our actors
As I foretold you were all spirits and
Are melted into air into thin air
And like the baseless fabric of this vision
The solemn temples the great globe itself
Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind We are such stuff
As dreams are made on and our little life
Bear with my weakness my old brain is troubled
To still my beating mind
FERDINAND MIRANDA We wish your peace                 Exeunt
PROSPERO Come with a thought I thank thee Ariel come
Enter ARIEL
PROSPERO Spirit
We must prepare to meet with Caliban
Lest I might anger thee
PROSPERO Say again where didst thou leave these varlets
So full of valour that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces beat the ground
For kissing of their feet yet always bending
Towards their project Then I beat my tabor
PROSPERO This was well done my bird
Thy shape invisible retain thou still
The trumpery in my house go bring it hither
For stale to catch these thieves
ARIEL I go I go                                        Exit
PROSPERO A devil a born devil on whose nature
Nurture can never stick on whom my pains
Humanely taken all all lost quite lost
And as with age his body uglier grows
So his mind cankers I will plague them all
Even to roaring
Come hang them on this line
Enter CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO all wet
CALIBAN Pray you tread softly that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall we now are near his cell
STEPHANO Monster your fairy which you say is a harmless
nose is in great indignation
STEPHANO So is mine Do you hear monster If I should
TRINCULO Thou wert but a lost monster
CALIBAN Good my lord give me thy favour still
Shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly
TRINCULO Ay but to lose our bottles in the pool
STEPHANO There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
that monster but an infinite loss
your harmless fairy monster
ears for my labour
CALIBAN Prithee my king be quiet Seest thou here
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own for ever and I thy Caliban
STEPHANO Give me thy hand I do begin to have bloody
thoughts
TRINCULO O King Stephano O peer O worthy Stephano
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee
CALIBAN Let it alone thou fool it is but trash
TRINCULO O ho monster we know what belongs to a
frippery O King Stephano

TRINCULO Thy Grace shall have it
CALIBAN The dropsy drown this fool What do you mean
And do the murder first If he awake
Make us strange stuff
STEPHANO Be you quiet monster Mistress line is not

jerkin you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald
jerkin
your Grace
TRINCULO Monster come put some lime upon your fingers
and away with the rest
With foreheads villainous low
of my kingdom Go to carry this
TRINCULO And this
STEPHANO Ay and this
A noise of hunters beard Enter divers SPIRITS in
shape of dogs and hounds bunting them about
PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on
PROSPERO Hey Mountain hey
ARIEL Silver there it goes Silver
PROSPERO Fury Fury There Tyrant there Hark hark
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions shorten up their sinews
ARIEL Hark they roar
PROSPERO Let them be hunted soundly At this hour
Lies at my mercy all mine enemies
Shortly shall all my labours end and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom for a little
Follow and do me service                            Exeunt

ACT V SCENE 1
Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes and ARIEL
PROSPERO Now does my project gather to a head
My charms crack not my spirits obey and time
ARIEL On the sixth hour at which time my lord
You said our work should cease
PROSPERO I did say so
In the same fashion as you gave in charge
Just as you left them all prisoners sir
They cannot budge till your release The King
His brother and yours abide all three distracted
And the remainder mourning over them
Brim full of sorrow and dismay but chiefly
That if you now beheld them your affections
Would become tender
PROSPERO Dost thou think so spirit
ARIEL Mine would sir were I human
PROSPERO And mine shall
Hast thou which art but air a touch a feeling
Of their afflictions and shall not myself
One of their kind that relish all as sharply
Do I take part the rarer action is
In virtue than in vengeance they being penitent
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
Not a frown further Go release them Ariel
And they shall be themselves
PROSPERO Ye elves of hills brooks standing lakes and
groves
And ye that on the sands with printless foot
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make
Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime
Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice
Set roaring war To the dread rattling thunder
The pine and cedar Graves at my command
By my so potent art But this rough magic
To work mine end upon their senses that
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth
And deeper than did ever plummet sound
Here enters ARIEL before then ALONSO with
frantic gesture attended by GONZALO SEBASTIAN
and ANTONIO in like manner attended by ADRIAN
and FRANCISCO They all enter the circle which
PROSPERO observing speaks
A solemn air and the best comforter
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains
Holy Gonzalo honourable man
Fall fellowly drops The charm dissolves apace
And as the morning steals upon the night
Melting the darkness so their rising senses
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
Their clearer reason O good Gonzalo
My true preserver and a loyal sir
Home both in word and deed Most cruelly
Didst thou Alonso use me and my daughter
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act
Unnatural though thou art Their understanding
Begins to swell and the approaching tide
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
That now lies foul and muddy Not one of them
That yet looks on me or would know me Ariel
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell           Exit ARIEL
I will discase me and myself present
As I was sometime Milan Quickly spirit
Thou shalt ere long be free
ARIEL on returning sings and helps to attire him
Where the bee sucks there suck I
There I couch when owls do cry
After summer merrily
Merrily merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough
But yet thou shalt have freedom So so so
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
Under the hatches the master and the boatswain
Being awake enforce them to this place
And presently I prithee
ARIEL I drink the air before me and return
Or ere your pulse twice beat                           Exit
GONZALO All torment trouble wonder and amazement
Inhabits here Some heavenly power guide us
Out of this fearful country
PROSPERO Behold Sir King
The wronged Duke of Milan Prospero
For more assurance that a living prince
Does now speak to thee I embrace thy body
And to thee and thy company I bid
A hearty welcome
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
As late I have been I not know Thy pulse
Beats as of flesh and blood and since I saw thee
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
Thou pardon me my wrongs But how should Prospero
Be living and be here
PROSPERO First noble friend
Let me embrace thine age whose honour cannot
GONZALO Whether this be
PROSPERO You do yet taste
Believe things certain Welcome my friends all
lords were I so minded
And justify you traitors at this time
I will tell no tales
PROSPERO No
For you most wicked sir whom to call brother
Would even infect my mouth I do forgive
My dukedom of thee which perforce I know
Thou must restore
ALONSO If thou beest Prospero
Give us particulars of thy preservation
How thou hast met us here whom three hours since
My dear son Ferdinand
ALONSO Irreparable is the loss and patience
Says it is past her cure
PROSPERO I rather think
You have not sought her help of whose soft grace
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
And rest myself content
ALONSO You the like loss
PROSPERO As great to me as late and supportable
To make the dear loss have I means much weaker
Than you may call to comfort you for I
Have lost my daughter
ALONSO A daughter
O heavens that they were living both in Naples
The King and Queen there That they were I wish
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
Where my son lies When did you lose your daughter
PROSPERO In this last tempest I perceive these lords
At this encounter do so much admire
That they devour their reason and scarce think
Their eyes do offices of truth their words
Been justled from your senses know for certain
That I am Prospero and that very duke
Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely
Upon this shore where you were wrecked was landed
Not a relation for a breakfast nor
Befitting this first meeting Welcome sir
And subjects none abroad pray you look in
My dukedom since you have given me again
I will requite you with as good a thing
At least bring forth a wonder to content ye
As much as me my dukedom
Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA
playing at chess
MIRANDA Sweet lord you play me false
FERDINAND No my dearest love
I would not for the world
MIRANDA Yes for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle
And I would call it fair play
ALONSO If this prove
A vision of the island one dear son
Shall I twice lose
SEBASTIAN A most high miracle
FERDINAND Though the seas threaten they are merciful
ALONSO Now all the blessings
Of a glad father compass thee about
MIRANDA O wonder
How many goodly creatures are there here
How beauteous mankind is O brave new world
ALONSO What is this maid with whom thou wast at play
And brought us thus together
FERDINAND Sir she is mortal
I chose her when I could not ask my father
For his advice nor thought I had one She
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan
Of whom so often I have heard renown
But never saw before of whom I have
This lady makes him to me
ALONSO I am hers
But O how oddly will it sound that I
Must ask my child forgiveness
PROSPERO There sir stop
Let us not burden our remembrances with
GONZALO I have inly wept
Or should have spoke ere this Look down you gods
And on this couple drop a blessed crown
Which brought us hither
ALONSO I say Amen Gonzalo
GONZALO Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue
Should become Kings of Naples O rejoice
Beyond a common joy and set it down
With gold on lasting pillars in one voyage
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis
And Ferdinand her brother found a wife
Where he himself was lost Prospero his dukedom
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
When no man was his own
hands
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
That doth not wish you joy
GONZALO Be it so Amen
amazedly following
O look sir look sir Here is more of us
I prophesied if a gallows were on land
This fellow could not drown Now blasphemy
Hast thou no mouth by land What is the news
BOATSWAIN The best news is that we have safely found
We first put out to sea
Have I done since I went
ALONSO These are not natural events they strengthen
From strange to stranger Say how came you hither
BOATSWAIN If I did think sir I were well awake
Where but even now with strange and several noises
Of roaring shrieking howling jingling chains
And moe diversity of sounds all horrible
Where we in all her trim freshly beheld
Our royal good and gallant ship our master
Even in a dream were we divided from them
And were brought moping hither
shalt be free
And there is in this business more than nature
Was ever conduct of Some oracle
Must rectify our knowledge
PROSPERO Sir my liege
Do not infest your mind with beating on
Which to you shall seem probable of every
hither spirit
Set Caliban and his companions free
There are yet missing of your company
Some few odd lads that you remember not
TRINCULO in their stolen apparel
STEPHANO Every man shift for all the rest and let no man
take care for himself for all is but fortune Coragio
TRINCULO If these be true spies which I wear in my head
CALIBAN O Setebos these be brave spirits indeed
How fine my master is I am afraid
He will chastise me
SEBASTIAN Ha ha
What things are these my lord Antonio
ANTONIO Very like one of them
Is a plain fish and no doubt marketable
PROSPERO Mark but the badges of these men my lords
His mother was a witch and one so strong
That could control the moon make flows and ebbs
And deal in her command without her power
To take my life Two of these fellows you
Must know and own this thing of darkness I
Acknowledge mine
ALONSO Is not this Stephano my drunken butler
SEBASTIAN He is drunk now where had he wine
ALONSO And Trinculo is reeling ripe where should they
TRINCULO I have been in such a pickle since I saw you
last that I fear me will never out of my bones I
SEBASTIAN Why how now Stephano
STEPHANO O touch me not I am not Stephano but a
cramp
STEPHANO I should have been a sore one then
PROSPERO He is as disproportioned in his manners
As in his shape Go sirrah to my cell
Take with you your companions as you look
To have my pardon trim it handsomely
Was I to take this drunkard for a god
And worship this dull fool
PROSPERO Go to away
ALONSO Hence and bestow your luggage where you found it
SEBASTIAN Or stole it rather
Exeunt CALIBAN STEPHANO and TRINCULO
PROSPERO Sir I invite your Highness and your train
To my poor cell where you shall take your rest
With such discourse as I not doubt shall make it
And the particular accidents gone by
Since I came to this isle And in the morn
Where I have hope to see the nuptial
And thence retire me to my Milan where
Every third thought shall be my grave
ALONSO I long
To hear the story of your life which must
Take the ear strangely
And promise you calm seas auspicious gales
And sail so expeditious that shall catch
chick
That is thy charge Then to the elements
Exeunt
EPILOGUE
EPILOGUE
Spoken by PROSPERO
Or sent to Naples Let me not
Since I have my dukedom got
In this bare island by your spell
But release me from my bands
With the help of your good hands
Gentle breath of yours my sails
Must fill or else my project fails
Which was to please Now I want
Spirits to enforce art to enchant
And my ending is despair
Which pierces so that it assaults
Mercy itself and frees all faults
Let your indulgence set me free

SCENE
Athens and the neighbouring woods
ACT I SCENE I
Enter POET PAINTER JEWELLER MERCHANT and MERCER at several doors
POET Good day sir
POET I have not seen you long how goes the world
PAINTER It wears sir as it grows
But what particular rarity What strange
Which manifold record not matches See
Magic of bounty all these spirits thy power
To an untirable and continuate goodness
He passes
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good
JEWELLER And rich Here is a water look ye
PAINTER You are rapt sir in some work some dedication
To the great lord
Our poesy is as a gum which oozes
Shows not till it be struck our gentle flame
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes What have you there
PAINTER A picture sir When comes your book forth
POET Upon the heels of my presentment sir
PAINTER Indifferent
POET Admirable How this grace
Speaks his own standing What a mental power
This eye shoots forth How big imagination
One might interpret
PAINTER It is a pretty mocking of the life
POET I will say of it
It tutors nature Artificial strife
Lives in these touches livelier than life
Enter certain SENATORS and pass over
PAINTER How this lord is followed
PAINTER Look moe
POET You see this confluence this great flood of visitors
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment My free drift
Halts not particularly but moves itself
Infects one comma in the course I hold
But flies an eagle flight bold and forth on
Leaving no tract behind
PAINTER How shall I understand you
POET I will unbolt to you
Of grave and austere quality tender down
Their services to Lord Timon His large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
To Apemantus that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself even he drops down
The knee before him and returns in peace
PAINTER I saw them speak together
POET Sir I have upon a high and pleasant hill
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states Amongst them all
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals
This throne this Fortune and this hill methinks
Bowing his head against the steepy mount
In our condition
POET Nay sir but hear me on
Follow his strides his lobbies fill with tendance
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear
Make sacred even his stirrup and through him
Drink the free air
PAINTER Ay marry what of these
POET When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved all his dependants
Even on their knees and hands let him slip down
Not one accompanying his declining foot
A thousand moral paintings I can show
More pregnantly than words Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head
Trumpets sound Enter TIMON addressing himself
courteously to every suitor a MESSENGER from
VENTIDIUS talking with him LUCILIUS and other
servants following
MESSENGER Ay my good lord Five talents is his debt
His means most short his creditors most strait
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up which failing
Periods his comfort
TIMON Noble Ventidius Well
I am not of that feather to shake of
My friend when he must need me I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help
MESSENGER Your lordship ever binds him
TIMON Commend me to him I will send his ransom
But to support him after Fare you well
MESSENGER All happiness to your honour                  Exit
Enter an OLD ATHENIAN
OLD ATHENIAN Lord Timon hear me speak
TIMON Freely good father
TIMON I have so what of him
OLD ATHENIAN Most noble Timon call the man before thee
TIMON Attends he here or no Lucilius
OLD ATHENIAN This fellow here Lord Timon this thy creature
By night frequents my house I am a man
Than one which holds a trencher
TIMON Well what further
OLD ATHENIAN One only daughter have I no kin else
On whom I may confer what I have got
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best This man of thine
Attempts her love I prithee noble lord
Join with me to forbid him her resort
Myself have spoke in vain
TIMON The man is honest
OLD ATHENIAN Therefore he will be Timon
His honesty rewards him in itself
It must not bear my daughter
TIMON Does she love him
OLD ATHENIAN She is young and apt
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
TIMON Love you the maid
LUCILIUS Ay my good lord and she accepts of it
OLD ATHENIAN If in her marriage my consent be missing
I call the gods to witness I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world
And dispossess her all
If she be mated with an equal husband
OLD ATHENIAN Three talents on the present in future all
To build his fortune I will strain a little
And make him weigh with her
OLD ATHENIAN Most noble lord
Pawn me to this your honour she is his

LUCILIUS Humbly I thank your lordship Never may
That state or fortune fall into my keeping
Which is not owed to you
Exeunt LUCILIUS and OLD ATHENIAN

TIMON I thank you you shall hear from me anon
Go not away What have you there my friend
PAINTER A piece of painting which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept
TIMON Painting is welcome
The painting is almost the natural man
Even such as they give out I like your work
And you shall find I like it wait attendance
Till you hear further from me
PAINTER The gods preserve ye
TIMON Well fare you gentleman Give me your hand
We must needs dine together Sir your jewel
Hath suffered under praise
JEWELLER What my lord Dispraise
TIMON A mere satiety of commendations
It would unclew me quite
As those which sell would give but you well know
Things of like value differing in the owners
You mend the jewel by the wearing it
Enter APEMANTUS
MERCHANT No my good lord he speaks the common tongue
Which all men speak with him
TIMON Look who comes here will you be chid
TIMON Good morrow to thee gentle Apemantus
APEMANTUS Till I be gentle stay thou for thy good morrow
APEMANTUS Are they not Athenians
TIMON Yes
APEMANTUS Then I repent not
JEWELLER You know me Apemantus
TIMON Thou art proud Apemantus
APEMANTUS Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon
TIMON Whither art going
APEMANTUS The best for the innocence
TIMON Wrought he not well that painted it
but a filthy piece of work
TIMON Wilt dine with me Apemantus
APEMANTUS No I eat not lords
APEMANTUS O they eat lords so they come by great bellies
TIMON How dost thou like this jewel Apemantus
APEMANTUS Not so well as plain dealing which will not cost a man
a doit
APEMANTUS Not worth my thinking How now poet
POET How now philosopher
APEMANTUS Thou liest
POET Art not one
APEMANTUS Yes
POET Then I lie not
APEMANTUS Art not a poet
POET Yes
APEMANTUS Then thou liest Look in thy last work where thou hast
APEMANTUS Yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy
Heavens that I were a lord
TIMON What wouldst do then Apemantus
TIMON What thyself
APEMANTUS Ay
TIMON Wherefore

MERCHANT Ay Apemantus
APEMANTUS Traffic confound thee if the gods will not
MERCHANT If traffic do it the gods do it
Trumpet sounds Enter a MESSENGER
All of companionship
TIMON Pray entertain them give them guide to us
Exeunt some attendants
You must needs dine with me Go not you hence
Show me this piece I am joyful of your sights
Enter ALCIBIADES with the rest
APEMANTUS So so there
Aches contract and starve your supple joints
That there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves
Into baboon and monkey
Most hungerly on your sight
TIMON Right welcome sir
In different pleasures Pray you let us in
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS
Enter two LORDS
APEMANTUS Time to be honest
FIRST LORD That time serves still
APEMANTUS Ay to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools
SECOND LORD Fare thee well fare thee well
APEMANTUS Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice
SECOND LORD Why Apemantus
APEMANTUS Shouldst have kept one to thyself for I mean to give
thee none
FIRST LORD Hang thyself
APEMANTUS No I will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests
to thy friend
The very heart of kindness
SECOND LORD He pours it out Plutus the god of gold
Is but his steward no meed but he repays
Sevenfold above itself no gift to him
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance
FIRST LORD The noblest mind he carries
SECOND LORD Long may he live in fortunes shall we in
SCENE II
FLAVIUS and others attending and then enter LORD TIMON the states
Then comes dropping after all APEMANTUS discontentedly like himself
VENTIDIUS Most honoured Timon
And call him to long peace
He is gone happy and has left me rich
Then as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart I do return those talents
Doubled with thanks and service from whose help
TIMON O by no means
Honest Ventidius You mistake my love
Can truly say he gives if he receives
If our betters play at that game we must not dare
To imitate them faults that are rich are fair
VENTIDIUS A noble spirit
To set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes
But where there is true friendship there needs none
Pray sit more welcome are ye to my fortunes
TIMON O Apemantus you are welcome
APEMANTUS No
You shall not make me welcome
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors
They say my lords Ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever
angry Go let him have a table by himself for he does neither
APEMANTUS Let me stay at thine apperil Timon
welcome I myself would have no power prithee let my meat make
thee silent
flatter thee O you gods what a number of men eats Timon and he
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men
Methinks they should invite them without knives
Good for their meat and safer for their lives
parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided
I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals
Great men should drink with harness on their throats
TIMON My lord in heart and let the health go round
SECOND LORD Let it flow this way my good lord
APEMANTUS Flow this way A brave fellow He keeps his tides well
Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill Timon
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods
Immortal gods I crave no pelf
I pray for no man but myself
Grant I may never prove so fond
To trust man on his oath or bond
Or a harlot for her weeping
Or a keeper with my freedom
Much good dich thy good heart Apemantus
ALCIBIADES My heart is ever at your service my lord
TIMON You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of
friends
APEMANTUS Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that
FIRST LORD Might we but have that happiness my lord that you
would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of
our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect
TIMON O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have
provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been
my friends else Why have you that charitable title from
thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own
behalf and thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what
up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have
are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call
our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious
Mine eyes cannot hold out water methinks To forget their
faults I drink to you
SECOND LORD Joy had the like conception in our eyes
And at that instant like a babe sprung up
APEMANTUS Ho ho I laugh to think that babe a bastard
TIMON What means that trump
Enter a SERVANT
How now
SERVANT Please you my lord there are certain ladies most
desirous of admittance
TIMON Ladies What are their wills
SERVANT There comes with them a forerunner my lord which bears
that office to signify their pleasures
TIMON I pray let them be admitted
Enter CUPID
CUPID Hail to thee worthy Timon and to all
That of his bounties taste The five best Senses
Acknowledge thee their patron and come freely
They only now come but to feast thine eyes
Music make their welcome                        Exit CUPID
with lutes in their hands dancing and playing
They dance They are mad women
Like madness is the glory of this life
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root
We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves
And spend our flatteries to drink those men
Upon whose age we void it up again
With poisonous spite and envy
Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves
I should fear those that dance before me now
Men shut their doors against a setting sun
The LORDS rise from table with much adoring of
TIMON and to show their loves each single out an
Amazon and all dance men witb women a lofty
strain or two to the hautboys and cease
TIMON You have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment
Which was not half so beautiful and kind
FIRST LADY My lord you take us even at the best
APEMANTUS Faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold
taking I doubt me
TIMON Ladies there is an idle banquet attends you
Please you to dispose yourselves
ALL LADIES Most thankfully my lord
Exeunt CUPID and LADIES
TIMON Flavius
FLAVIUS My lord
TIMON The little casket bring me hither
FIRST LORD Where be our men
SERVANT Here my lord in readiness
SECOND LORD Our horses
TIMON O my friends
I have one word to say to you Look you my good lord
I must entreat you honour me so much
As to advance this jewel accept it and wear it
Kind my lord
ALL So are we all
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT My lord there are certain nobles of the Senate newly
alighted and come to visit you
TIMON They are fairly welcome                   Exit SERVANT
FLAVIUS I beseech your honour vouchsafe me a word it does
concern you near
be provided to show them entertainment
Enter another SERVANT
SECOND SERVANT May it please vour honour Lord Lucius out of his
in silver
TIMON I shall accept them fairly Let the presents
Enter a third SERVANT
How now What news
THIRD SERVANT Please you my lord that honourable gentleman Lord
has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds
Not without fair reward                        Exit SERVANT
He commands us to provide and give great gifts
And all out of an empty coffer
Nor will he know his purse or yield me this
To show him what a beggar his heart is
Being of no power to make his wishes good
His promises fly so beyond his state
That what he speaks is all in debt he owes
Well would I were gently put out of office
Happier is he that has no friend to feed
I bleed inwardly for my lord                           Exit
TIMON You do yourselves much wrong
You bate too much of your own merits
Here my lord a trifle of our love
SECOND LORD With more than common thanks I will receive it
TIMON And now I remember my lord you gave good words the other
THIRD LORD O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that
TIMON You may take my word my lord I know no man
Can justly praise but what he does affect
ALL LORDS O none so welcome
TIMON I take all and your several visitations
Methinks I could deal kingdoms to my friends
Thou art a soldier therefore seldom rich
It comes in charity to thee for all thy living
TIMON And so am I to you
TIMON All to you Lights more lights
FIRST LORD The best of happiness honour and fortunes keep with
you Lord Timon
TIMON Ready for his friends
Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies
TIMON Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen
I would be good to thee
would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin
away thyself in paper shortly What needs these feasts pomps
TIMON Nay an you begin to rail on society once I am sworn not to
give regard to you Farewell and come with better music
Exit
lock thy heaven from thee
To counsel deaf but not to flattery                   Exit

ACT II SCENE I
Enter A SENATOR with papers in his hand
SENATOR And late five thousand To Varro and to Isidore
He owes nine thousand besides my former sum
Which makes it five and twenty Still in motion
Of raging waste It cannot hold it will not
And give it Timon why the dog coins gold
If I would sell my horse and buy twenty moe
Better than he why give my horse to Timon
Ask nothing give it him it foals me straight
And able horses No porter at his gate
But rather one that smiles and still invites
All that pass by It cannot hold no reason
Can sound his state in safety Caphis ho
Caphis I say
Enter CAPHIS
CAPHIS Here sir what is your pleasure
SENATOR Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon
Plays in the right hand thus but tell him
My uses cry to me I must serve my turn
Out of mine own his days and times are past
And my reliances on his fracted dates
Have smit my credit I love and honour him
But must not break my back to heal his finger
Immediate are my needs and my relief
But find supply immediate Get you gone
Put on a most importunate aspect
A visage of demand for I do fear
When every feather sticks in his own wing
Lord Timon will be left a naked gull
Which flashes now a phoenix Get you gone
CAPHIS I go sir
SENATOR Take the bonds along with you
And have the dates in compt
CAPHIS I will sir
SENATOR Go                                            Exeunt
SCENE II
FLAVIUS No care no stop So senseless of expense
That he will neither know how to maintain it
Nor cease his flow of riot takes no account
How things go from him nor resumes no care
Of what is to continue Never mind
Was to be so unwise to be so kind
What shall be done He will not hear till feel
I must be round with him Now he comes from hunting
Fie fie fie fie
Enter CAPHIS and the SERVANTS Of ISIDORE and VARRO
CAPHIS Good even Varro What you come for money
CAPHIS It is And yours too Isidore
CAPHIS Here comes the lord

CAPHIS My lord here is a note of certain dues
TIMON Dues Whence are you
CAPHIS Of Athens here my lord
TIMON Go to my steward
CAPHIS Please it your lordship he hath put me off
To the succession of new days this month
To call upon his own and humbly prays you
In giving him his right
TIMON Mine honest friend
I prithee but repair to me next morning
TIMON Contain thyself good friend
past
I am sent expressly to your lordship
TIMON Give me breath
I do beseech you good my lords keep on
Exeunt ALCIBIADES and LORDS
Against my honour
FLAVIUS Please you gentlemen
The time is unagreeable to this business
Your importunacy cease till after dinner
That I may make his lordship understand
Wherefore you are not paid
TIMON Do so my friends
FLAVIUS Pray draw near                                  Exit
Enter APEMANTUS and FOOL

APEMANTUS Would I had a rod in my mouth that I might answer thee
profitably
PAGE Prithee Apemantus read me the superscription of these
letters I know not which is which
APEMANTUS Canst not read
PAGE No
APEMANTUS There will little learning die then that day thou art
Answer not I am gone                             Exit PAGE
FOOL Will you leave me there
APEMANTUS If Timon stay at home You three serve three usurers
thief
ALL SERVANTS Ay fool
FOOL I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant My mistress
is one and I am her fool When men come to borrow of your
masters they approach sadly and go away merry but they enter my
APEMANTUS Do it then that we may account thee a whoremaster and a
knave which notwithstanding thou shalt be no less esteemed
artificial one He is very often like a knight and generally
in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to
thirteen this spirit walks in
FOOL Nor thou altogether a wise man
APEMANTUS That answer might have become Apemantus
APEMANTUS Come with me fool come
FOOL I do not always follow lover elder brother and woman
sometime the philosopher
Exeunt APEMANTUS and FOOL
Exeunt SERVANTS
TIMON You make me marvel wherefore ere this time
Had you not fully laid my state before me
That I might so have rated my expense
As I had leave of means
FLAVIUS You would not hear me
TIMON Go to
Perchance some single vantages you took
When my indisposition put you back
And that unaptness made your minister
Thus to excuse yourself
FLAVIUS O my good lord
At many times I brought in my accounts
Laid them before you you would throw them off
And say you found them in mine honesty
When for some trifling present you have bid me
Return so much I have shook my head and wept
To hold your hand more close I did endure
Not seldom nor no slight checks when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts
TIMON Let all my land be sold
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
Of present dues The future comes apace
What shall defend the interim And at length
TIMON To Lacedaemon did my land extend
FLAVIUS O my good lord the world is but a word
Were it all yours to give it in a breath
How quickly were it gone
TIMON You tell me true
FLAVIUS If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood
And set me on the proof So the gods bless me
With riotous feeders when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine when every room
And set mine eyes at flow
TIMON Prithee no more
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
Ah when the means are gone that buy this praise
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made
TIMON Come sermon me no further
Unwisely not ignobly have I given
Why dost thou weep Canst thou the conscience lack
To think I shall lack friends Secure thy heart
If I would broach the vessels of my love
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing
As I can bid thee speak
FLAVIUS Assurance bless your thoughts
That I account them blessings for by these
Shall I try friends You shall perceive how you
Mistake my fortunes I am wealthy in my friends
Within there Flaminius Servilius
Enter FLAMINIUS SERVILIUS and another SERVANT
SERVANTS My lord my lord
Commend me to their loves and I am proud say that my occasions
request be fifty talents
FLAMINIUS As you have said my lord          Exeunt SERVANTS
TIMON Go you sir to the senators
A thousand talents to me
FLAVIUS I have been bold
For that I knew it the most general way
To them to use your signet and your name
But they do shake their heads and I am here
No richer in return
FLAVIUS They answer in a joint and corporate voice
That now they are at fall want treasure cannot
And so intending other serious matters
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions
They froze me into silence
TIMON You gods reward them
Prithee man look cheerly These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary
And nature as it grows again toward earth
Go to Ventidius Prithee be not sad
Thou art true and honest ingeniously I speak
No blame belongs to thee Ventidius lately
Into a great estate When he was poor
Bid him suppose some good necessity
FLAVIUS I would I could not think it
Being free itself it thinks all others so           Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
FLAMINIUS waiting to speak with LUCULLUS Enter SERVANT to him
SERVANT I have told my lord of you he is coming down to you
FLAMINIUS I thank you sir
Enter LUCULLUS
Flaminius honest Flaminius you are very respectively welcome
honourable complete freehearted gentleman of Athens thy very
bountiful good lord and master
FLAMINIUS His health is well sir
LUCULLUS I am right glad that his health is well sir And what
hast thou there under thy cloak pretty Flaminius
behalf I come to entreat your honour to supply  who having
great and instant occasion to use fifty talents hath sent to
your lordship to furnish him nothing doubting your present
assistance therein
spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning
SERVANT Please your lordship here is the wine
FLAMINIUS Your lordship speaks your pleasure
LUCULLUS I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit
give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason and
canst use the time well if the time use thee well Good parts in
to me that this is no time to lend money especially upon bare
LUCULLUS Ha Now I see thou art a fool and fit for thy master
Exit
FLAMINIUS May these add to the number that may scald thee
Let molten coin be thy damnation
Thou disease of a friend and not himself
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart
It turns in less than two nights O you gods
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
Which my lord paid for be of any power
To expel sickness but prolong his hour                Exit
SCENE II
A public place
Enter Lucius with three STRANGERS
LUCIUS Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an
honourable gentleman
FIRST STRANGER We know him for no less though we are but
strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and
are done and past and his estate shrinks from him
LUCIUS Fie no do not believe it he cannot want for money
SECOND STRANGER But believe you this my lord that not long ago
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many
LUCIUS How
SECOND STRANGER I tell you denied my lord
LUCIUS What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am
received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels
occasion so many talents
Enter SERVILIUS
LUCIUS Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well commend
me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend
LUCIUS Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord
has he sent now
SERVILIUS Has only sent his present occasion now my lord
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many
talents
LUCIUS I know his lordship is but merry with me
SERVILIUS But in the mean time he wants less my lord
If his occasion were not virtuous
I should not urge it half so faithfully
LUCIUS Dost thou speak seriously Servilius
LUCIUS What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such
little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now
was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can
now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his
honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power
to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my
greatest afflictions say that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far
as to use mine own words to him
SERVILIUS Yes sir I shall
Exit SERVILIUS
True as you said Timon is shrunk indeed
FIRST STRANGER Do you observe this Hostilius
SECOND STRANGER Ay too well
piece
That dips in the same dish For in my knowing
And kept his credit with his purse
He does deny him in respect of his
What charitable men afford to beggars
THIRD STRANGER Religion groans at it
FIRST STRANGER For mine own part
I never tasted Timon in my life
Nor came any of his bounties over me
To mark me for his friend yet I protest
For his right noble mind illustrious virtue
And honourable carriage
Had his necessity made use of me
I would have put my wealth into donation
So much I love his heart But I perceive
Men must learn now with pity to dispense
For policy sits above conscience                     Exeunt
SCENE III
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus
And now Ventidius is wealthy too
Owe their estates unto him
SERVANT My lord
They have all denied him
SEMPRONIUS How Have they denied him
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him
And does he send to me Three Humh
It shows but little love or judgment in him
Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians
For in my conscience I was the first man
And does he think so backwardly of me now
So it may prove an argument of laughter
And with their faint reply this answer join
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin           Exit
will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul
Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot
ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire
Of such a nature is his politic love
Save only the gods Now his friends are dead
Now to guard sure their master
And this is all a liberal course allows
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house         Exit
SCENE IV
Then enter TITUS and HORTENSIUS
TITUS The like to you kind Varro
HORTENSIUS Lucius What do we meet together
for mine is money
TITUS So is theirs and ours
Enter PHILOTUS
PHILOTUS Good day at once
PHILOTUS Labouring for nine
PHILOTUS Is not my lord seen yet
You must consider that a prodigal course
I fear
That is one may reach deep enough and yet
Find little
PHILOTUS I am of your fear for that
Your lord sends now for money
HORTENSIUS Most true he does
For which I wait for money
HORTENSIUS It is against my heart
Timon in this should pay more than he owes
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth
yours
Enter FLAMINIUS
come forth
FLAMINIUS No indeed he is not
TITUS We attend his lordship pray signify so much
FLAMINIUS I need not tell him that he knows you are to diligent
Exit
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak muffled
He goes away in a cloud Call him call him
TITUS Do you hear sir
FLAVIUS What do ye ask of me my friend
TITUS We wait for certain money here sir
FLAVIUS Ay
If money were as certain as your waiting
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up
Let me pass quietly
I have no more to reckon he to spend
For you serve knaves                                   Exit
revenge enough Who can speak broader than he that has no house
to put his head in Such may rail against great buildings
Enter SERVILIUS
SERVILIUS If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other
leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has
And if it be so far beyond his health
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts
And make a clear way to the gods
SERVILIUS Good gods
TITUS We cannot take this for answer sir
Enter TIMON in a rage FLAMINIUS following
Have I been ever free and must my house
Be my retentive enemy my gaol
The place which I have feasted does it now
Like all mankind show me an iron heart
TITUS My lord here is my bill
HORTENSIUS And mine my lord
PHILOTUS All our bills
TIMON Cut my heart in sums
TITUS Mine fifty talents
TIMON Tell out my blood
TIMON Five thousand drops pays that What yours and yours
TIMON Tear me take me and the gods fall upon you      Exit
HORTENSIUS Faith I perceive our masters may throw their caps at
Creditors Devils
TIMON What if it should be so
FLAVIUS Here my lord
TIMON So fitly Go bid all my friends again
FLAVIUS O my lord
You only speak from your distracted soul
There is not so much left to furnish out
A moderate table
TIMON Be it not in thy care
Go I charge thee invite them all let in the tide
SCENE V
The Senate House
Enter three SENATORS at one door ALCIBIADES meeting them with attendants
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy
SECOND SENATOR Most true the law shall bruise him
ALCIBIADES Honour health and compassion to the Senate
FIRST SENATOR Now Captain
ALCIBIADES I am an humble suitor to your virtues
For pity is the virtue of the law
And none but tyrants use it cruelly
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood
He is a man setting his fate aside
Of comely virtues
But with a noble fury and fair spirit
He did oppose his foe
And with such sober and unnoted passion
FIRST SENATOR You undergo too strict a paradox
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair
To bring manslaughter into form and set
Quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born
The worst that man can breathe
And make his wrongs his outsides
To wear them like his raiment carelessly
To bring it into danger
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill
FIRST SENATOR You cannot make gross sins look clear
To revenge is no valour but to bear
ALCIBIADES My lords then under favour pardon me
If I speak like a captain
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle
And let the foes quietly cut their throats
Without repugnancy If there be
Such valour in the bearing what make we
Abroad Why then women are more valiant
That stay at home if bearing carry it
And the ass more captain than the lion the fellow
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge
If wisdom be in suffering O my lords
As you are great be pitifully good
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood
To be in anger is impiety
But who is man that is not angry
Weigh but the crime with this
SECOND SENATOR You breathe in vain
ALCIBIADES In vain His service done
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
Were a sufficient briber for his life
ALCIBIADES Why I say my lords has done fair service
And slain in fight many of your enemies
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds
Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner
If there were no foes that were enough
To overcome him In that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages
His days are foul and his drink dangerous
FIRST SENATOR He dies
ALCIBIADES Hard fate He might have died in war
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And for I know your reverend ages love
My honours to you upon his good returns
If by this crime he owes the law his life
For law is strict and war is nothing more
FIRST SENATOR We are for law he dies Urge it no more
On height of our displeasure Friend or brother
He forfeits his own blood that spills another
ALCIBIADES Must it be so It must not be My lords
I do beseech you know me
SECOND SENATOR How
ALCIBIADES Call me to your remembrances
THIRD SENATOR What
ALCIBIADES I cannot think but your age has forgot me
It could not else be I should prove so base
To sue and be denied such common grace
My wounds ache at you
FIRST SENATOR Do you dare our anger
We banish thee for ever
ALCIBIADES Banish me
Banish your dotage Banish usury
That makes the Senate ugly
Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit
He shall be executed presently              Exeunt SENATORS
ALCIBIADES Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
Only in bone that none may look on you
While they have told their money and let out
Their coin upon large interest I myself
Rich only in large hurts All those for this
Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury
My discontented troops and lay for hearts
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods         Exit
SCENE VI
Music Tables set out servants attending Enter divers LORDS
friends of TIMON at several doors
FIRST LORD The good time of day to you sir
SECOND LORD I also wish it to you I think this honourable lord
did but try us this other day
I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial
of his several friends
SECOND LORD It should not be by the persuasion of his new
feasting
FIRST LORD I should think so He hath sent me an earnest inviting
which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath
SECOND LORD In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he
sent to borrow of me that my provision was out
FIRST LORD I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all
things go
you
FIRST LORD A thousand pieces
SECOND LORD A thousand pieces
FIRST LORD What of you
Enter TIMON and attendants
TIMON With all my heart gentlemen both And how fare you
FIRST LORD Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship
SECOND LORD The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
your lordship
stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so
FIRST LORD I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that
TIMON O sir let it not trouble you
TIMON Ah my good friend what cheer
when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so
unfortunate a beggar
FIRST LORD Royal cheer I warrant you
THIRD LORD Doubt not that if money and the season can yield it
FIRST LORD How how
SECOND LORD I pray you upon what
TIMON My worthy friends will you draw near
SECOND LORD This is the old man still
THIRD LORD I do conceive
TIMON Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip
of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike Make not
a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon
the first place Sit sit The gods require our thanks
You great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness
give lest your deities be despised Lend to each man enough
borrow of men men would forsake the gods Make the meat be
beloved more than the man that gives it Let no assembly of
twenty be without a score of villains If there sit twelve women
your foes O gods the senators of Athens together with the
common lag of people what is amiss in them you gods make
suitable for destruction For these my present friends as they
are to me nothing so in nothing bless them and to nothing are
they welcome
SOME SPEAK What does his lordship mean
SOME OTHER I know not
TIMON May you a better feast never behold
Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries
Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces
Most smiling smooth detested parasites
Courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears
Of man and beast the infinite malady
Soft take thy physic first thou too and thou
What all in motion Henceforth be no feast
Burn house Sink Athens Henceforth hated be
Of Timon man and all humanity                          Exit
FIRST LORD How now my lords
THIRD LORD Push Did you see my cap
FOURTH LORD I have lost my gown
my hat Did you see my jewel
THIRD LORD Did you see my cap
FOURTH LORD Here lies my gown
FOURTH LORD One day he gives us diamonds next day stones
Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
Without the walls of Athens
Enter TIMON
TIMON Let me look back upon thee O thou wall
That girdles in those wolves dive in the earth
And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent
Obedience fail in children Slaves and fools
Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench
And minister in their steads To general filths
Rather than render back out with your knives
With it beat out his brains Piety and fear
Religion to the gods peace justice truth
Instruction manners mysteries and trades
Degrees observances customs and laws
Decline to your confounding contraries
And let confusion live Plagues incident to men
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica
Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth
And drown themselves in riot Itches blains
Be general leprosy Breath infect breath
That their society as their friendship may
But nakedness thou detestable town
Take thou that too with multiplying bans
Timon will to the woods where he shall find
The Athenians both within and out that wall
And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind high and low
Amen                                                   Exit
SCENE II
Enter FLAVIUS with two or three SERVANTS
Are we undone cast off nothing remaining
FLAVIUS Alack my fellows what should I say to you
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods
I am as poor as you
FIRST SERVANT Such a house broke
One friend to take his fortune by the arm
And go along with him
SECOND SERVANT As we do turn our backs
From our companion thrown into his grave
So his familiars to his buried fortunes
Slink all away leave their false vows with him
A dedicated beggar to the air
Walks like contempt alone More of our fellows
Enter other SERVANTS
That see I by our faces We are fellows still
And we poor mates stand on the dying deck
Hearing the surges threat We must all part
Into this sea of air
FLAVIUS Good fellows all
Nay put out all your hands Not one word more
Thus part we rich in sorrow parting poor
O the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt
Since riches point to misery and contempt
But in a dream of friendship
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
Poor honest lord brought low by his own heart
Undone by goodness Strange unusual blood
Who then dares to be half so kind again
For bounty that makes gods does still mar men
Are made thy chief afflictions Alas kind lord
Of monstrous friends nor has he with him to
Supply his life or that which can command it
SCENE III
Enter TIMON in the woods
TIMON O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth
Whose procreation residence and birth
The greater scorns the lesser Not nature
To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune
But by contempt of nature
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary
The beggar native honour
The want that makes him lean Who dares who dares
In purity of manhood stand upright
So are they all for every grise of fortune
All feasts societies and throngs of men
His semblable yea himself Timon disdains
Destruction fang mankind Earth yield me roots
Who seeks for better of thee sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison What is here
Gold Yellow glittering precious gold No gods
I am no idle votarist Roots you clear heavens
Thus much of this will make black white foul fair
Wrong right base noble old young coward valiant
Ha you gods why this What this you gods Why this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides
This yellow slave
And give them title knee and approbation
With senators on the bench This is it
Would cast the gorge at this embalms and spices
Thou common whore of mankind that puts odds
Among the rout of nations I will make thee
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand
Enter ALCIBIADES with drum and fife in warlike
manner and PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA
ALCIBIADES What art thou there Speak
TIMON A beast as thou art The canker gnaw thy heart
For showing me again the eyes of man
ALCIBIADES What is thy name Is man so hateful to thee
That art thyself a man
TIMON I am Misanthropos and hate mankind
For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog
That I might love thee something
ALCIBIADES I know thee well
TIMON I know thee too and more than that I know thee
I not desire to know Follow thy drum
Religious canons civil laws are cruel
Then what should war be This fell whore of thine
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword
For all her cherubin look
PHRYNIA Thy lips rot off
TIMON I will not kiss thee then the rot returns
To thine own lips again
ALCIBIADES How came the noble Timon to this change
TIMON As the moon does by wanting light to give
But then renew I could not like the moon
There were no suns to borrow of
ALCIBIADES Noble Timon
What friendship may I do thee
TIMON None but to
Maintain my opinion
ALCIBIADES What is it Timon
TIMON Promise me friendship but perform none If thou wilt not
promise the gods plague thee for thou art man If thou dost
perform confound thee for thou art a man
ALCIBIADES I have heard in some sort of thy miseries
ALCIBIADES I see them now then was a blessed time
TIMON As thine is now held with a brace of harlots
TIMON Art thou Timandra
TIMANDRA Yes
TIMON Be a whore still they love thee not that use thee
Give them diseases leaving with thee their lust
Make use of thy salt hours Season the slaves
TIMANDRA Hang thee monster
ALCIBIADES Pardon him sweet Timandra for his wits
I have but little gold of late brave Timon
The want whereof doth daily make revolt
How cursed Athens mindless of thy worth
Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states
TIMON I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone
ALCIBIADES I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon
TIMON How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble
I had rather be alone
ALCIBIADES Why fare thee well
Here is some gold for thee
TIMON Keep it I cannot eat it
ALCIBIADES Ay Timon and have cause
TIMON The gods confound them all in thy conquest
ALCIBIADES Why me Timon
TIMON That by killing of villains
Thou wast born to conquer my country
Be as a planetary plague when Jove
In the sick air let not thy sword skip one
He is an usurer Strike me the counterfeit matron
It is her habit only that is honest
Make soft thy trenchant sword for those milk paps
Are not within the leaf of pity writ
But set them down horrible traitors Spare not the babe
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy
Think it a bastard whom the oracle
And mince it sans remorse Swear against abjects
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes
Whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding
Make large confusion and thy fury spent
Confounded be thyself Speak not be gone
Not all thy counsel
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA Give us some gold good Timon
Hast thou more
TIMON Enough to make a whore forswear her trade
And to make whores a bawd Hold up you sluts
Your aprons mountant you are not oathable
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
Be strong in whore allure him burn him up
Let your close fire predominate his smoke
And be no turncoats Yet may your pains six months
Be quite contrary And thatch your poor thin roofs
No matter Wear them betray with them Whore still
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face
A pox of wrinkles
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA Well more gold What then
TIMON Consumptions sow
In hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins
That he may never more false title plead
Nor sound his quillets shrilly Hoar the flamen
That scolds against the quality of flesh
And not believes himself Down with the nose
Down with it flat take the bridge quite away
Of him that his particular to foresee
Derive some pain from you Plague all
That your activity may defeat and quell
Do you damn others and let this damn you
And ditches grave you all
PHRYNIA AND TIMANDRA More counsel with more money bounteous
Timon
TIMON More whore more mischief first I have given you earnest
ALCIBIADES Strike up the drum towards Athens Farewell Timon
ALCIBIADES I never did thee harm
TIMON Men daily find it Get thee away and take
Thy beagles with thee
ALCIBIADES We but offend him Strike
Drum beats Exeunt all but TIMON
Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
Engenders the black toad and adder blue
Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate
From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man
Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears
Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face
Hath to the marbled mansion all above
Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts
And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind
Enter APEMANTUS
More man Plague plague
APEMANTUS I was directed hither Men report
Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them
Whom I would imitate Consumption catch thee
APEMANTUS This is in thee a nature but infected
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
From change of fortune Why this spade this place
Thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft
That ever Timon was Shame not these woods
By putting on the cunning of a carper
Be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive
By that which has undone thee hinge thy knee
Blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain
And call it excellent Thou wast told thus
That thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again
APEMANTUS Thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself
That the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain
Will put thy shirt on warm Will these moist trees
Candied with ice caudle thy morning taste
Whose naked natures live in all the spite
Of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks
TIMON A fool of thee Depart
TIMON I hate thee worse
APEMANTUS Why
APEMANTUS I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff
TIMON Why dost thou seek me out
APEMANTUS To vex thee
APEMANTUS Ay
TIMON What a knave too
Wert thou not beggar Willing misery
The one is filling still never complete
The other at high wish Best state contentless
Hath a distracted and most wretched being
Worse than the worst content
TIMON Not by his breath that is more miserable
Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
To such as may the passive drugs of it
In general riot melted down thy youth
The icy precepts of respect but followed
Who had the world as my confectionary
The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men
At duty more than I could frame employment
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
Fell from their boughs and left me open bare
That never knew but better is some burden
Thy nature did commence in sufferance time
If thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag
Must be thy subject who in spite put stuff
Poor rogue hereditary Hence be gone
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer
APEMANTUS Art thou proud yet
TIMON Ay that I am not thee
APEMANTUS I that I was
No prodigal
TIMON I that I am one now
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee
That the whole life of Athens were in this
APEMANTUS Here I will mend thy feast
TIMON First mend my company take away thyself
If not I would it were
APEMANTUS What wouldst thou have to Athens
TIMON Thee thither in a whirlwind If thou wilt
Tell them there I have gold look so I have
APEMANTUS Here is no use for gold
TIMON The best and truest
For here it sleeps and does no hired harm
APEMANTUS Where liest a nights Timon
APEMANTUS Where my stomach finds meat or rather where I eat it
TIMON Would poison were obedient and knew my mind
APEMANTUS Where wouldst thou send it
TIMON To sauce thy dishes
APEMANTUS The middle of humanity thou never knewest but the
extremity of both ends When thou wast in thy gilt and thy
medlar for thee eat it
TIMON On what I hate I feed not
APEMANTUS Dost hate a medlar
TIMON Ay though it look like thee
loved thyself better now What man didst thou ever know unthrift
that was beloved after his means
APEMANTUS Myself
TIMON I understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog
APEMANTUS What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to
thy flatterers
TIMON Women nearest but men men are the things themselves What
wouldst thou do with the world Apemantus if it lay in thy
power
APEMANTUS Give it the beasts to be rid of the men
TIMON Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and
remain a beast with the beasts
APEMANTUS Ay Timon
If thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert
the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion
ass If thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and
the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou
shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner Wert thou the unicorn
pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the
leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to the lion and
the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life All thy safety
were remotion and thy defence absence What beast couldst thou
be that were not subject to a beast And what beast art thou
already that seest not thy loss in transformation
APEMANTUS If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou
mightst have hit upon it here The commonwealth of Athens is
become a forest of beasts
TIMON How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the
city
APEMANTUS Yonder comes a poet and a painter The plague of company
light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I
TIMON When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be
APEMANTUS Thou art the cap of all the fools alive
TIMON Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon
APEMANTUS A plague on thee thou art too bad to curse
TIMON All villains that do stand by thee are pure
TIMON If I name thee
APEMANTUS I would my tongue could rot them off
TIMON Away thou issue of a mangy dog
Choler does kill me that thou art alive
I swoon to see thee
APEMANTUS Would thou wouldst burst
TIMON Away
Thou tedious rogue I am sorry I shall lose
APEMANTUS Beast
TIMON Slave
APEMANTUS Toad
TIMON Rogue rogue rogue
I am sick of this false world and will love nought
Then Timon presently prepare thy grave
Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
Thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
To every purpose O thou touch of hearts
Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue
Set them into confounding odds that beasts
May have the world in empire
APEMANTUS Ay
TIMON Thy back I prithee
APEMANTUS Live and love thy misery
things like men Eat Timon and abhor them
Enter the BANDITTI
FIRST BANDIT Where should he have this gold It is some poor
fragment some slender ort of his remainder The mere want of
melancholy
he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how
FIRST BANDIT Is not this he
BANDITTI Where
THIRD BANDIT He I know him
BANDITTI Save thee Timon
TIMON Now thieves
BANDITTI Soldiers not thieves
BANDITTI We are not thieves but men that much do want
TIMON Your greatest want is you want much of meat
Why should you want Behold the earth hath roots
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs
The oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips
The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush
Lays her full mess before you Want Why want
FIRST BANDIT We cannot live on grass on berries water
As beasts and birds and fishes
TIMON Nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes
You must eat men Yet thanks I must you con
In holier shapes for there is boundless theft
In limited professions Rascal thieves
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth
And so scape hanging Trust not the physician
His antidotes are poison and he slays
Moe than you rob Take wealth and lives together
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun
The laws your curb and whip in their rough power
All that you meet are thieves To Athens go
Break open shops nothing can you steal
But thieves do lose it Steal not less for this
Amen
persuading me to it
us not to have us thrive in our mystery
trade
FIRST BANDIT Let us first see peace in Athens There is no time so
miserable but a man may be true              Exeunt THIEVES
Enter FLAVIUS to TIMON
FLAVIUS O you gods
Full of decay and failing O monument
What an alteration of honour
What viler thing upon the earth than friends
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends
Grant I may ever love and rather woo
Those that would mischief me than those that do
Has caught me in his eye I will present
My honest grief unto him and as my lord
Still serve him with my life My dearest master
TIMON Away What art thou
FLAVIUS Have you forgot me sir
TIMON Why dost ask that I have forgot all men
FLAVIUS An honest poor servant of yours
TIMON Then I know thee not
I never had honest man about me I
All I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains
FLAVIUS The gods are witness
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you
TIMON What dost thou weep Come nearer Then I love thee
Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give
Strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping
FLAVIUS I beg of you to know me good my lord
To entertain me as your steward still
TIMON Had I a steward
So true so just and now so comfortable
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild
Let me behold thy face Surely this man
Was born of woman
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness
How fain would I have hated all mankind
I fell with curses
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise
For by oppressing and betraying me
Thou mightst have sooner got another service
For many so arrive at second masters
Is not thy kindness subtle covetous
If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts
Expecting in return twenty for one
FLAVIUS No my most worthy master in whose breast
Suspect still comes where an estate is least
That which I show heaven knows is merely love
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind
Care of your food and living and believe it
For any benefit that points to me
For this one wish that you had power and wealth
To requite me by making rich yourself
Here take The gods out of my misery
Have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy
Hate all curse all show charity to none
Ere thou relieve the beggar Give to dogs
And may diseases lick up their false bloods
And so farewell and thrive
FLAVIUS O let me stay
And comfort you my master
Stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free
Exeunt severally

ACT V SCENE I
Enter POET and PAINTER
PAINTER As I took note of the place it cannot be far where he
abides
so full of gold
PAINTER Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had
POET Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends
PAINTER Nothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again
honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what
they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his
having
POET What have you now to present unto him
PAINTER Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will
promise him an excellent piece
toward him
it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller
for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most
courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or
testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that
makes it
Enter TIMON from his cave
as is thyself
POET I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It
must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness
of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that
follow youth and opulency
work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have
gold for thee
Then do we sin against our own estate
When we may profit meet and come too late
PAINTER True
Come
Than where swine feed
Settlest admired reverence in a slave
To thee be worship and thy saints for aye
POET Hail worthy Timon
PAINTER Our late noble master
POET Sir
Having often of your open bounty tasted
What to you
To their whole being I am rapt and cannot cover
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
With any size of words
You that are honest by being what you are
Make them best seen and known
PAINTER He and myself
And sweetly felt it
TIMON Ay you are honest men
PAINTER We are hither come to offer you our service
TIMON Most honest men Why how shall I requite you
PAINTER So it is said my noble lord but therefore
Came not my friend nor I
PAINTER So so my lord
Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
That thou art even natural in thine art
I must needs say you have a little fault
You take much pains to mend
BOTH Beseech your honour
To make it known to us
BOTH Most thankfully my lord
TIMON Will you indeed
BOTH Doubt it not worthy lord
That mightily deceives you
BOTH Do we my lord
TIMON Ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble
Know his gross patchery love him feed him
PAINTER I know not such my lord
POET Nor I
Rid me these villains from your companies
Hang them or stab them drown them in a draught
Confound them by some course and come to me
Each man apart all single and alone
Enter FLAVIUS and two SENATORS
FLAVIUS It is vain that you would speak with Timon
For he is set so only to himself
That nothing but himself which looks like man
Is friendly with him
FIRST SENATOR Bring us to his cave
To speak with Timon
SECOND SENATOR At all times alike
Offering the fortunes of his former days
The former man may make him Bring us to him
And chance it as it may
FLAVIUS Here is his cave
Peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon
By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee
Speak to them noble Timon
Enter TIMON out of his cave
For each true word a blister and each false
Consuming it with speaking
TIMON Of none but such as you and you of Timon
FIRST SENATOR The senators of Athens greet thee Timon
TIMON I thank them and would send them back the plague
Could I but catch it for them
FIRST SENATOR O forget
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee
The senators with one consent of love
Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought
On special dignities which vacant lie
For thy best use and wearing
SECOND SENATOR They confess
Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross
Which now the public body which doth seldom
Play the recanter feeling in itself
Of it own fail restraining aid to Timon
And send forth us to make their sorrowed render
Together with a recompense more fruitful
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram
Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
And write in thee the figures of their love
Ever to read them thine
TIMON You witch me in it
Surprise me to the very brink of tears
FIRST SENATOR Therefore so please thee to return with us
And of our Athens thine and ours to take
The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks
Live with authority So soon we shall drive back
Who like a boar too savage doth root up
Against the walls of Athens
TIMON Well sir I will Therefore I will sir thus
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon
That Timon cares not But if he sack fair Athens
Giving our holy virgins to the stain
I cannot choose but tell him that I care not
While you have throats to answer For myself
But I do prize it at my love before
To the protection of the prosperous gods
As thieves to keepers
TIMON Why I was writing of my epitaph
Of health and living now begins to mend
And nothing brings me all things Go live still
Be Alcibiades your plague you his
And last so long enough
FIRST SENATOR We speak in vain
TIMON But yet I love my country and am not
One that rejoices in the common wreck
As common bruit doth put it
FIRST SENATOR These words become your lips as they pass through
them
SECOND SENATOR And enter in our ears like great triumphers
In their applauding gates
TIMON Commend me to them
And tell them that to ease them of their griefs
Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses
Their pangs of love with other incident throes
FIRST SENATOR I like this well he will return again
TIMON I have a tree which grows here in my close
That mine own use invites me to cut down
And shortly must I fell it Tell my friends
Tell Athens in the sequence of degree
From high to low throughout that whoso please
To stop affliction let him take his haste
Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe
And hang himself I pray you do my greeting
FLAVIUS Trouble him no further thus you still shall find him
TIMON Come not to me again but say to Athens
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood
Who once a day with his embossed froth
The turbulent surge shall cover Thither come
And let my gravestone be your oracle
Lips let sour words go by and language end
What is amiss plague and infection mend
Sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reign
Exit TIMON into his cave
FIRST SENATOR His discontents are unremovably
Coupled to nature
SECOND SENATOR Our hope in him is dead Let us return
And strain what other means is left unto us
In our dear peril
FIRST SENATOR It requires swift foot                  Exeunt
SCENE II
Before the walls of Athens
Enter two other SENATORS with a MESSENGER
As full as thy report
MESSENGER I have spoke the least
Besides his expedition promises
Present approach
SECOND SENATOR We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon
MESSENGER I met a courier one mine ancient friend
Yet our old love had a particular force
And made us speak like friends This man was riding
With letters of entreaty which imported
Enter the other SENATORS from TIMON
FIRST SENATOR Here come our brothers
THIRD SENATOR No talk of Timon nothing of him expect
Doth choke the air with dust In and prepare
Ours is the fall I fear our foes the snare         Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter a SOLDIER in the woods seeking TIMON
SOLDIER By all description this should be the place
Our captain hath in every figure skill
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is                 Exit
SCENE IV
Before the walls of Athens
Trumpets sound Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers before Athens
ALCIBIADES Sound to this coward and lascivious town
Our terrible approach
Sound a parley The SENATORS appear upon the walls
With all licentious measure making your wills
The scope of justice till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Our sufferance vainly Now the time is flush
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
With fear and horrid flight
FIRST SENATOR Noble and young
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear
We sent to thee to give thy rages balm
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity
SECOND SENATOR So did we woo
We were not all unkind nor all deserve
The common stroke of war
FIRST SENATOR These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
For private faults in them
SECOND SENATOR Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out
Shame that they wanted cunning in excess
Hath broke their hearts March noble lord
Into our city with thy banners spread
If thy revenges hunger for that food
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted
FIRST SENATOR All have not offended
For those that were it is not square to take
On those that are revenge crimes like lands
Are not inherited Then dear countryman
Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended Like a shepherd
But kill not all together
SECOND SENATOR What thou wilt
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
FIRST SENATOR Set but thy foot
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before
SECOND SENATOR Throw thy glove
Or any token of thine honour else
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion all thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town till we
Descend and open your uncharged ports
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall and no more And to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning not a man
Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream
At heaviest answer
ALCIBIADES Descend and keep your words
Enter a SOLDIER as a Messenger
SOLDIER My noble General Timon is dead
With wax I brought away whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance
ALCIBIADES reads the Epitaph
Seek not my name A plague consume you wicked caitiffs left
Here lie I Timon who alive all living men did hate
Pass by and curse thy fill but pass and stay not here thy
These well express in thee thy latter spirits
From niggard nature fall yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave on faults forgiven Dead
Is noble Timon of whose memory
Hereafter more Bring me into your city
And I will use the olive with my sword
Make war breed peace make peace stint war make each
Let our drums strike                                 Exeunt

SCENE
Rome and the neighbourhood
ACT 1 SCENE I
Rome Before the Capitol
Flourish Enter the TRIBUNES and SENATORS aloft and then enter below
SATURNINUS and his followers at one door and BASSIANUS and his followers
at the other with drums and trumpets
SATURNINUS Noble patricians patrons of my right
Defend the justice of my cause with arms
And countrymen my loving followers
Plead my successive title with your swords
I am his first born son that was the last
That ware the imperial diadem of Rome
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity
BASSIANUS Romans friends followers favourers of my right
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome
Keep then this passage to the Capitol
And suffer not dishonour to approach
The imperial seat to virtue consecrate
To justice continence and nobility
But let desert in pure election shine
And Romans fight for freedom in your choice
Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS aloft with the crown
MARCUS Princes that strive by factions and by friends
Ambitiously for rule and empery
Know that the people of Rome for whom we stand
A special party have by common voice
In election for the Roman empery
Chosen Andronicus surnamed Pius
For many good and great deserts to Rome
A nobler man a braver warrior
Lives not this day within the city walls
He by the Senate is accited home
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths
That with his sons a terror to our foes
Ten years are spent since first he undertook
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
Bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons
In coffins from the field and at this day
To the monument of that Andronici
Done sacrifice of expiation
And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome
Renowned Titus flourishing in arms
Let us entreat by honour of his name
Whom worthily you would have now succeed
Whom you pretend to honour and adore
That you withdraw you and abate your strength
Dismiss your followers and as suitors should
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness
SATURNINUS How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts
BASSIANUS Marcus Andronicus so I do affy
In thy uprightness and integrity
And so I love and honour thee and thine
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all
That I will here dismiss my loving friends
Exeunt the soldiers of BASSIANUS
SATURNINUS Friends that have been thus forward in my right
I thank you all and here dismiss you all
And to the love and favour of my country
Commit myself my person and the cause
Exeunt the soldiers of SATURNINUS
Rome be as just and gracious unto me
As I am confident and kind to thee
Open the gates and let me in
BASSIANUS Tribunes and me a poor competitor
Enter a CAPTAIN
CAPTAIN Romans make way The good Andronicus
Successful in the battles that he fights
From where he circumscribed with his sword
And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome
Sound drums and trumpets and then enter MARTIUS
bearing a coffin covered with black then LUCIUS
and QUINTUS two other sons then TITUS ANDRONICUS
and then TAMORA the Queen of Goths with her three
sons ALARBUS DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with AARON the
Moor and others  as many as can be Then set down
the coffin and TITUS speaks
TITUS Hail Rome victorious in thy mourning weeds
Returns with precious lading to the bay
Cometh Andronicus bound with laurel boughs
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome
Thou great defender of this Capitol
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend
Romans of five and twenty valiant sons
Half of the number that King Priam had
Behold the poor remains alive and dead
These that survive let Rome reward with love
These that I bring unto their latest home
With burial amongst their ancestors
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword
Titus unkind and careless of thine own
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx
Make way to lay them by their brethren
There greet in silence as the dead are wont
O sacred receptacle of my joys
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility
How many sons hast thou of mine in store
That thou wilt never render to me more
LUCIUS Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths
That we may hew his limbs and on a pile
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh
Before this earthy prison of their bones
The eldest son of this distressed queen
TAMORA Stay Roman brethen Gracious conqueror
Victorious Titus rue the tears I shed
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee
O think my son to be as dear to me
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome
To beautify thy triumphs and return
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke
But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets
O if to fight for king and commonweal
Were piety in thine it is in these
Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods
Draw near them then in being merciful
TITUS Patient yourself madam and pardon me
These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld
Alive and dead and for their brethren slain
Religiously they ask a sacrifice
LUCIUS Away with him and make a fire straight
And with our swords upon a pile of wood
TAMORA O cruel irreligious piety
CHIRON Was never Scythia half so barbarous
DEMETRIUS Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome
Alarbus goes to rest and we survive
With opportunity of sharp revenge
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes
MUTIUS the sons of ANDRONICUS with their swords bloody
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire
Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky
Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren
TITUS Let it be so and let Andronicus
Make this his latest farewell to their souls
In peace and honour rest you here my sons
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps
Here lurks no treason here no envy swells
Here grow no damned drugs here are no storms
No noise but silence and eternal sleep
In peace and honour rest you here my sons
Enter LAVINIA
LAVINIA In peace and honour live Lord Titus long
My noble lord and father live in fame
Lo at this tomb my tributary tears
And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy
Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome
O bless me here with thy victorious hand
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart
Enter above MARCUS ANDRONICUS and TRIBUNES
MARCUS Long live Lord Titus my beloved brother
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome
TITUS Thanks gentle Tribune noble brother Marcus
MARCUS And welcome nephews from successful wars
You that survive and you that sleep in fame
Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp
Titus Andronicus the people of Rome
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been
Send thee by me their Tribune and their trust
And name thee in election for the empire
Be candidatus then and put it on
And help to set a head on headless Rome
TITUS A better head her glorious body fits
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness
What should I don this robe and trouble you
And set abroad new business for you all
Rome I have been thy soldier forty years
And buried one and twenty valiant sons
Knighted in field slain manfully in arms
In right and service of their noble country
Give me a staff of honour for mine age
But not a sceptre to control the world
Upright he held it lords that held it last
MARCUS Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery
SATURNINUS Proud and ambitious Tribune canst thou tell
TITUS Patience Prince Saturninus
SATURNINUS Romans do me right
Patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not
LUCIUS Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good
TITUS Content thee Prince I will restore to thee
BASSIANUS Andronicus I do not flatter thee
But honour thee and will do till I die
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends
I will most thankful be and thanks to men
Of noble minds is honourable meed
I ask your voices and your suffrages
Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus
TRIBUNES To gratify the good Andronicus
And gratulate his safe return to Rome
The people will accept whom he admits
TITUS Tribunes I thank you and this suit I make
Lord Saturnine whose virtues will I hope
And ripen justice in this commonweal
Then if you will elect by my advice
MARCUS With voices and applause of every sort
Patricians and plebeians we create
SATURNINUS Titus Andronicus for thy favours done
To us in our election this day
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness
And for an onset Titus to advance
Thy name and honourable family
Lavinia will I make my emperess
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse
Tell me Andronicus doth this motion please thee
TITUS It doth my worthy lord and in this match
I hold me highly honoured of your Grace
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine
King and commander of our commonweal
My sword my chariot and my prisoners
Receive them then the tribute that I owe
SATURNINUS Thanks noble Titus father of my life
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
Rome shall record and when I do forget
The least of these unspeakable deserts
Romans forget your fealty to me
To him that for your honour and your state
Will use you nobly and your followers
Clear up fair Queen that cloudy countenance
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer
Princely shall be thy usage every way
Rest on my word and let not discontent
Daunt all your hopes Madam he comforts you
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths
LAVINIA Not I my lord sith true nobility
Warrants these words in princely courtesy
SATURNINUS Thanks sweet Lavinia Romans let us go
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free
Proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum
BASSIANUS Lord Titus by your leave this maid is mine
TITUS How sir Are you in earnest then my lord
To do myself this reason and this right
MARCUS Suum cuique is our Roman justice
This prince in justice seizeth but his own
LUCIUS And that he will and shall if Lucius live
BASSIANUS By him that justly may
Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA
MUTIUS Brothers help to convey her hence away
Exeunt LUCIUS QUINTUS and MARTIUS
MUTIUS My lord you pass not here
TITUS What villain boy
MUTIUS Help Lucius help
TITUS kills him During the fray exeunt SATURNINUS
TAMORA DEMETRIUS CHIRON and AARON
LUCIUS My lord you are unjust and more than so
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son
TITUS Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine
My sons would never so dishonour me
with TAMORA and her two Sons and AARON the Moor
Traitor restore Lavinia to the Emperor
LUCIUS Dead if you will but not to be his wife
SATURNINUS No Titus no the Emperor needs her not
Nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock
Thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons
Confederates all thus to dishonour me
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale
But Saturnine Full well Andronicus
Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine
TITUS O monstrous What reproachful words are these
SATURNINUS But go thy ways go give that changing piece
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome
TITUS These words are razors to my wounded heart
SATURNINUS And therefore lovely Tamora Queen of Goths
Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride
And will create thee Emperess of Rome
Speak Queen of Goths dost thou applaud my choice
Sith priest and holy water are so near
And tapers burn so bright and everything
Or climb my palace till from forth this place
TAMORA And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths
She will a handmaid be to his desires
A loving nurse a mother to his youth
SATURNINUS Ascend fair Queen Pantheon Lords accompany
Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered
There shall we consummate our spousal rites
Exeunt all but TITUS
TITUS I am not bid to wait upon this bride
TITUS when wert thou wont to walk alone
Dishonoured thus and challenged of wrongs
MARCUS O Titus see O see what thou hast done
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son
Nor thou nor these confederates in the deed
That hath dishonoured all our family
Unworthy brother and unworthy sons
LUCIUS But let us give him burial as becomes
Give Mutius burial with our bretheren
TITUS Traitors away He rests not in this tomb
This monument five hundred years hath stood
Repose in fame none basely slain in brawls
Bury him where you can he comes not here
MARCUS My lord this is impiety in you
He must be buried with his bretheren
QUINTUS & MARTIUS And shall or him we will accompany
QUINTUS He that would vouch it in any place but here
TITUS What would you bury him in my despite
MARCUS No noble Titus but entreat of thee
To pardon Mutius and to bury him
TITUS Marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest
And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded
My foes I do repute you every one
So trouble me no more but get you gone
MARTIUS He is not with himself let us withdraw
TITUS Speak thou no more if all the rest will speed
MARCUS Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
Did graciously plead for his funerals
Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy
TITUS Rise Marcus rise
To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome
Well bury him and bury me the next
LUCIUS There lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
Whether by device or no the heavens can tell
Is she not then beholding to the man
That brought her for this high good turn so far
MARCUS Yes and will nobly him remunerate
and her two SONS with the MOOR at one door
at the other door BASSIANUS and LAVINIA with others
God give you joy sir of your gallant bride
BASSIANUS And you of yours my lord I say no more
Nor wish no less and so I take my leave
SATURNINUS Traitor if Rome have law or we have power
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape
BASSIANUS Rape call you it my lord to seize my own
My true betrothed love and now my wife
But let the laws of Rome determine all
BASSIANUS My lord what I have done as best I may
Answer I must and shall do with my life
Only thus much I give your Grace to know
By all the duties that I owe to Rome
This noble gentleman Lord Titus here
That in the rescue of Lavinia
With his own hand did slay his youngest son
Receive him then to favour Saturnine
A father and a friend to thee and Rome
TITUS Prince Bassianus leave to plead my deeds
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge
TAMORA My worthy lord if ever Tamora
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine
Then hear me speak indifferently for all
And at my suit sweet pardon what is past
SATURNINUS What madam be dishonoured openly
And basely put it up without revenge
TAMORA Not so my lord the gods of Rome forfend
I should be author to dishonour you
But on mine honour dare I undertake
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs
Then at my suit look graciously on him
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart
be won at last
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents
You are but newly planted in your throne
Lest then the people and patricians too
And so supplant you for ingratitude
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin
Yield at entreats and then let me alone
And raze their faction and their family
The cruel father and his traitorous sons
Come come sweet Emperor come Andronicus
Take up this good old man and cheer the heart
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown
TITUS I thank your Majesty and her my lord
These words these looks infuse new life in me
TAMORA Titus I am incorporate in Rome
A Roman now adopted happily
And must advise the Emperor for his good
This day all quarrels die Andronicus
And let it be mine honour good my lord
My word and promise to the Emperor
That you will be more mild and tractable
By my advice all humbled on your knees
You shall ask pardon of his Majesty
LUCIUS We do and vow to heaven and to his Highness
That what we did was mildly as we might
MARCUS That on mine honour here do I protest
SATURNINUS Away and talk not trouble us no more
TAMORA Nay nay sweet Emperor we must all be friends
The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace
I will not be denied Sweet heart look back
Stand up
Lavinia though you left me like a churl
I found a friend and sure as death I swore
I would not part a bachelor from the priest
You are my guest Lavinia and your friends
To hunt the panther and the hart with me
SATURNINUS Be it so Titus and gramercy too
Exeunt Sound trumpets

ACT II SCENE I
Rome Before the palace
Enter AARON
As when the golden sun salutes the morn
And having gilt the ocean with his beams
Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach
So Tamora
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown
Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress
And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold
To wait said I To wanton with this queen
This goddess this Semiramis this nymph
Hullo what storm is this
Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS braving
DEMETRIUS Chiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge
And may for aught thou knowest affected be
And so in this to bear me down with braves
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate
I am as able and as fit as thou
And that my sword upon thee shall approve
peace
Gave you a dancing rapier by your side
Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends
Go to have your lath glued within your sheath
Till you know better how to handle it
CHIRON Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare
And maintain such a quarrel openly
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge
I would not for a million of gold
The cause were known to them it most concerns
Nor would your noble mother for much more
Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome
For shame put up
My rapier in his bosom and withal
Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat
AARON Away I say
Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore
This pretty brabble will undo us all
Why lords and think you not how dangerous
What is Lavinia then become so loose
Or Bassianus so degenerate
Without controlment justice or revenge
Young lords beware an should the Empress know
CHIRON I care not I knew she and all the world
I love Lavinia more than all the world
DEMETRIUS Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice
AARON Why are ye mad or know ye not in Rome
How furious and impatient they be
And cannot brook competitors in love
I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths
By this device
CHIRON Aaron a thousand deaths
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love
She is a woman therefore may be won
What man more water glideth by the mill
Than wots the miller of and easy it is
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know
DEMETRIUS Then why should he despair that knows to court it
With words fair looks and liberality
What hast not thou full often struck a doe
AARON Why then it seems some certain snatch or so
Would serve your turns
CHIRON Ay so the turn were served
DEMETRIUS Aaron thou hast hit it
AARON Would you had hit it too
Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools
To square for this Would it offend you then
That both should speed
CHIRON Faith not me
DEMETRIUS Nor me so I were one
AARON For shame be friends and join for that you jar
That you affect and so must you resolve
That what you cannot as you would achieve
You must perforce accomplish as you may
Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste
Must we pursue and I have found the path
My lords a solemn hunting is in hand
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop
The forest walks are wide and spacious
And many unfrequented plots there are
Fitted by kind for rape and villainy
Single you thither then this dainty doe
And strike her home by force if not by words
This way or not at all stand you in hope
Come come our Empress with her sacred wit
To villainy and vengeance consecrate
Will we acquaint with all what we intend
And she shall file our engines with advice
That will not suffer you to square yourselves
The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears
The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull
There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns
CHIRON Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice
DEMETRIUS Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream
To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits
Per Styga per manes vehor                           Exeunt
SCENE II
A forest near Rome
Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS and his three sons LUCIUS QUINTUS MARTIUS
making a noise with hounds and horns and MARCUS
TITUS The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green
Uncouple here and let us make a bay
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride
That all the court may echo with the noise
Sons let it be your charge as it is ours
I have been troubled in my sleep this night
Here a cry of hounds and wind horns in a peal
Then enter SATURNINUS TAMORA BASSIANUS LAVINIA
CHIRON DEMETRIUS and their attendants
Many good morrows to your Majesty
Madam to you as many and as good
BASSIANUS Lavinia how say you
LAVINIA I say no
I have been broad awake two hours and more
SATURNINUS Come on then horse and chariots let us have
Our Roman hunting
MARCUS I have dogs my lord
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase
And climb the highest promontory top
TITUS And I have horse will follow where the game
DEMETRIUS Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground             Exeunt
SCENE III
A lonely part of the forest
Enter AARON alone with a bag of gold
AARON He that had wit would think that I had none
To bury so much gold under a tree
And never after to inherit it
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem
Which cunningly effected will beget
A very excellent piece of villainy
And so repose sweet gold for their unrest
Enter TAMORA alone to the Moor
When everything does make a gleeful boast
The birds chant melody on every bush
The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit
And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds
As if a double hunt were heard at once
Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise
Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep
AARON Madam though Venus govern your desires
Saturn is dominator over mine
My silence and my cloudy melancholy
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
Even as an adder when she doth unroll
To do some fatal execution
No madam these are no venereal signs
Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head
Hark Tamora the empress of my soul
This is the day of doom for Bassianus
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee
Now question me no more we are espied
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty
Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA
TAMORA Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life
AARON No more great Empress Bassianus comes
Or is it Dian habited like her
Who hath abandoned her holy groves
To see the general hunting in this forest
TAMORA Saucy controller of my private steps
Thy temples should be planted presently
Unmannerly intruder as thou art
LAVINIA Under your patience gentle Emperess
And to be doubted that your Moor and you
Are singled forth to try thy experiments
BASSIANUS Believe me Queen your swarth Cimmerian
Spotted detested and abominable
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor
If foul desire had not conducted you
LAVINIA And being intercepted in your sport
Great reason that my noble lord be rated
For sauciness I pray you let us hence
This valley fits the purpose passing well
BASSIANUS The King my brother shall have notice of this
LAVINIA Ay for these slips have made him noted long
Good king to be so mightily abused
TAMORA Why I have patience to endure all this
Enter CHIRON and DEMETRIUS
DEMETRIUS How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother
Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan
TAMORA Have I not reason think you to look pale
A barren detested vale you see it is
The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean
Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe
Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven
They told me here at dead time of the night
A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes
Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins
Would make such fearful and confused cries
As any mortal body hearing it
Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly
No sooner had they told this hellish tale
But straight they told me they would bind me here
Unto the body of a dismal yew
And leave me to this miserable death
Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms
That ever ear did hear to such effect
And had you not by wondrous fortune come
This vengeance on me had they executed
DEMETRIUS This is a witness that I am thy son
CHIRON And this for me struck home to show my strength
For no name fits thy nature but thy own
TAMORA Give me the poniard you shall know my boys
DEMETRIUS Stay madam here is more belongs to her
First thrash the corn then after burn the straw
This minion stood upon her chastity
Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness
And shall she carry this unto her grave
CHIRON An if she do I would I were an eunuch
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust
TAMORA But when ye have the honey we desire
Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting
CHIRON I warrant you madam we will make that sure
Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy
TAMORA I will not hear her speak away with her
LAVINIA Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word
DEMETRIUS Listen fair madam let it be your glory
To see her tears but be your heart to them
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike
CHIRON What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests
O be to me though thy hard heart say no
Nothing so kind but something pitiful
TAMORA I know not what it means away with her
That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee
Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears
Even for his sake am I pitiless
To save your brother from the sacrifice
But fierce Andronicus would not relent
Therefore away with her and use her as you will
And with thine own hands kill me in this place
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell
O keep me from their worse than killing lust
And tumble me into some loathsome pit
Do this and be a charitable murderer
TAMORA So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee
No let them satisfy their lust on thee
LAVINIA No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature
The blot and enemy to our general name
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him
DEMETRIUS throws the body
of BASSIANUS into the pit then exeunt
DEMETRIUS and CHIRON dragging off LAVINIA
TAMORA Farewell my sons see that you make her sure
Till all the Andronici be made away
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower          Exit
AARON Come on my lords the better foot before
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
Where I espied the panther fast asleep
MARTIUS And mine I promise you were it not for shame
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile
QUINTUS What art thou fallen What subtle hole is this
A very fatal place it seems to me
Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall
That ever eye with sight made heart lament
That he thereby may have a likely guess
How these were they that made away his brother         Exit
MARTIUS Why dost not comfort me and help me out
QUINTUS I am surprised with an uncouth fear
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see
MARTIUS To prove thou hast a true divining heart
Aaron and thou look down into this den
And see a fearful sight of blood and death
QUINTUS Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise
Was I a child to fear I know not what
All on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb
MARTIUS Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
A precious ring that lightens all this hole
Which like a taper in some monument
And shows the ragged entrails of this pit
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
Out of this fell devouring receptacle
QUINTUS Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out
Or wanting strength to do thee so much good
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink
MARTIUS Nor I no strength to climb without thy help
QUINTUS Thy hand once more I will not loose again
Till thou art here aloft or I below
Enter the EMPEROR and AARON the Moor
And what he is that now is leapt into it
Say who art thou that lately didst descend
Into this gaping hollow of the earth
MARTIUS The unhappy sons of old Andronicus
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour
To find thy brother Bassianus dead
SATURNINUS My brother dead I know thou dost but jest
He and his lady both are at the lodge
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase
MARTIUS We know not where you left them all alive
But out alas here have we found him dead
attendants TITUS ANDRONICUS and Lucius
TAMORA Where is my lord the King
TAMORA Where is thy brother Bassianus
SATURNINUS Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered
TAMORA Then all too late I bring this fatal writ
The complot of this timeless tragedy
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus
O Tamora was ever heard the like
Look sirs if you can find the huntsman out
That should have murdered Bassianus here
AARON My gracious lord here is the bag of gold
kind
Have here bereft my brother of his life
Sirs drag them from the pit unto the prison
TAMORA What are they in this pit O wondrous thing
How easily murder is discovered
TITUS High Emperor upon my feeble knee
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed
Who found this letter Tamora was it you
TAMORA Andronicus himself did take it up
TITUS I did my lord yet let me be their bail
To answer their suspicion with their lives
SATURNINUS Thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me
Some bring the murdered body some the murderers
For by my soul were there worse end than death
That end upon them should be executed
TAMORA Andronicus I will entreat the King
Fear not thy sons they shall do well enough
TITUS Come Lucius come stay not to talk with them     Exeunt
SCENE IV
Another part of the forest
DEMETRIUS So now go tell an if thy tongue can speak
CHIRON Write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so
An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe
DEMETRIUS See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl
CHIRON Go home call for sweet water wash thy hands
DEMETRIUS She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash
DEMETRIUS If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
Wind horns Enter MARCUS from hunting
Cousin a word where is your husband
If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me
If I do wake some planet strike me down
That I may slumber an eternal sleep
Speak gentle niece What stern ungentle hands
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in
And might not gain so great a happiness
As half thy love Why dost not speak to me
Alas a crimson river of warm blood
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips
Coming and going with thy honey breath
But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee
And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue
O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast
That I might rail at him to ease my mind
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is
Fair Philomel why she but lost her tongue
But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee
A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
O had the monster seen those lily hands
Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
Which that sweet tongue hath made
Come let us go and make thy father blind
Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee
O could our mourning case thy misery                Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Rome A street
MARTIUS and QUINTUS bound passing on the stage to the place of execution
and TITUS going before pleading
TITUS Hear me grave fathers noble Tribunes stay
For pity of mine age whose youth was spent
In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept
And for these bitter tears which now you see
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks
Be pitiful to my condemned sons
For two and twenty sons I never wept
For these Tribunes in the dust I write
O earth I will befriend thee more with rain
That shall distil from these two ancient urns
Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn
O reverend Tribunes O gentle aged men
Unbind my sons reverse the doom of death
And let me say that never wept before
My tears are now prevailing orators
LUCIUS O noble father you lament in vain
The Tribunes hear you not no man is by
And you recount your sorrows to a stone
TITUS Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead
Grave Tribunes once more I entreat of you
LUCIUS My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak
They would not mark me if they did mark
They would not pity me yet plead I must
And bootless unto them
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones
Who though they cannot answer my distress
Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes
For that they will not intercept my tale
When I do weep they humbly at my feet
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me
And were they but attired in grave weeds
Rome could afford no tribunes like to these
A stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones
A stone is silent and offendeth not
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death
LUCIUS To rescue my two brothers from their death
My everlasting doom of banishment
TITUS O happy man they have befriended thee
Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers
Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey
But me and mine how happy art thou then
From these devourers to be banished
But who comes with our brother Marcus here
Enter MARCUS with LAVINIA
MARCUS Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep
Or if not so thy noble heart to break
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age
TITUS Will it consume me Let me see it then
MARCUS This was thy daughter
TITUS Why Marcus so she is
LUCIUS Ay me this object kills me
Speak Lavinia what accursed hand
What fool hath added water to the sea
And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds
For they have fought for Rome and all in vain
In bootless prayer have they been held up
Now all the service I require of them
Is that the one will help to cut the other
For hands to do Rome service is but vain
MARCUS O that delightful engine of her thoughts
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage
Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear
LUCIUS O say thou for her who hath done this deed
MARCUS O thus I found her straying in the park
Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer
TITUS It was my dear and he that wounded her
For now I stand as one upon a rock
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave
Expecting ever when some envious surge
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him
This way to death my wretched sons are gone
And here my brother weeping at my woes
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight
It would have madded me what shall I do
Now I behold thy lively body so
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears
Thy husband he is dead and for his death
Look Marcus Ah son Lucius look on her
When I did name her brothers then fresh tears
Stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew
Perchance because she knows them innocent
TITUS If they did kill thy husband then be joyful
No no they would not do so foul a deed
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes
Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius
And thou and I sit round about some fountain
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
With miry slime left on them by a flood
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows
Pass the remainder of our hateful days
What shall we do Let us that have our tongues
Plot some device of further misery
LUCIUS Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps
MARCUS Patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes
TITUS Ah Marcus Marcus Brother well I wot
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine
LUCIUS Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks
TITUS Mark Marcus mark I understand her signs
Had she a tongue to speak now would she say
That to her brother which I said to thee
His napkin with his true tears all bewet
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks
O what a sympathy of woe is this
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss
Enter AARON the Moor
AARON Titus Andronicus my lord the Emperor
Sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons
Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus
Or any one of you chop off your hand
And send it to the King he for the same
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive
And that shall be the ransom for their fault
TITUS O gracious Emperor O gentle Aaron
Did ever raven sing so like a lark
Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off
LUCIUS Stay father for that noble hand of thine
That hath thrown down so many enemies
Shall not be sent My hand will serve the turn
My youth can better spare my blood than you
MARCUS Which of your hands hath not defended Rome
O none of both but are of high desert
My hand hath been but idle let it serve
To ransom my two nephews from their death
Then have I kept it to a worthy end
AARON Nay come agree whose hand shall go along
For fear they die before their pardon come
MARCUS My hand shall go
LUCIUS By heaven it shall not go
Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine
LUCIUS Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son
Let me redeem my brothers both from death
TITUS Agree between you I will spare my hand
MARCUS But I will use the axe
Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS
Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine
And never whilst I live deceive men so
Good Aaron give his Majesty my hand
Tell him it was a hand that warded him
From thousand dangers bid him bury it
As for my sons say I account of them
And yet dear too because I bought mine own
AARON I go Andronicus and for thy hand
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace
Aaron will have his soul black like his face           Exit
TITUS O here I lift this one hand up to heaven
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth
If any power pities wretched tears
Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers
And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms
MARCUS O brother speak with possibility
And do not break into these deep extremes
TITUS Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom
Then be my passions bottomless with them
MARCUS But yet let reason govern thy lament
TITUS If there were reason for these miseries
Then into limits could I bind my woes
If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil
I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow
She is the weeping welkin I the earth
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs
Then must my earth with her continual tears
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes
But like a drunkard must I vomit them
Then give me leave for losers will have leave
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues
Enter a MESSENGER with two heads and a hand
MESSENGER Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons
That woe is me to think upon thy woes
MARCUS Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily
These miseries are more than may be borne
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal
But sorrow flouted at is double death
LUCIUS Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound
And yet detested life not shrink thereat
That ever death should let life bear his name
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe
MARCUS Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless
As frozen water to a starved snake
TITUS When will this fearful slumber have an end
Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here
Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I
Even like a stony image cold and numb
Ah now no more will I control thy griefs
Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand
Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight
The closing up of our most wretched eyes
Now is a time to storm why art thou still
TITUS Ha ha ha
MARCUS Why dost thou laugh It fits not with this hour
TITUS Why I have not another tear to shed
Besides this sorrow is an enemy
And make them blind with tributary tears
For these two heads do seem to speak to me
And threat me I shall never come to bliss
Even in their throats that have committed them
Come let me see what task I have to do
You heavy people circle me about
That I may turn me to each one of you
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs
The vow is made Come brother take a head
And in this hand the other will I bear
Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth
As for thee boy go get thee from my sight
Thou art an exile and thou must not stay
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there
And if ye love me as I think you do
Exeunt all but Lucius
LUCIUS Farewell Andronicus my noble father
Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life
Farewell Lavinia my noble sister
O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
But in oblivion and hateful griefs
If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs
And make proud Saturnine and his emperess
Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen
SCENE II
A banquet
Enter TITUS MARCUS LAVINIA and the boy YOUNG LUCIUS
TITUS So so now sit and look you eat no more
Than will preserve just so much strength in us
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours
Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
With folded arms This poor right hand of mine
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast
Who when my heart all mad with misery
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh
Then thus I thump it down
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still
Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans
Or get some little knife between thy teeth
And just against thy heart make thou a hole
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
May run into that sink and soaking in
MARCUS Fie brother fie Teach her not thus to lay
Such violent hands upon her tender life
TITUS How now Has sorrow made thee dote already
Why Marcus no man should be mad but I
What violent hands can she lay on her life
Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable
O handle not the theme to talk of hands
Lest we remember still that we have none
Fie fie how franticly I square my talk
As if we should forget we had no hands
If Marcus did not name the word of hands
She says she drinks no other drink but tears
Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
As begging hermits in their holy prayers
Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven
Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign
But I of these will wrest an alphabet
And by still practice learn to know thy meaning
BOY Good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale
TITUS Peace tender sapling thou art made of tears
And tears will quickly melt thy life away
What dost thou strike at Marcus with thy knife
A deed of death done on the innocent
I see thou art not for my company
How would he hang his slender gilded wings
And buzz lamenting doings in the air
Poor harmless fly
That with his pretty buzzing melody
TITUS O O O
Then pardon me for reprehending thee
For thou hast done a charitable deed
Give me thy knife I will insult on him
Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
Come hither purposely to poison me
Ah sirrah
Yet I think we are not brought so low
But that between us we can kill a fly
MARCUS Alas poor man grief has so wrought on him
He takes false shadows for true substances
TITUS Come take away Lavinia go with me
Sad stories chanced in the times of old
Come boy and go with me thy sight is young
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle        Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
Enter YOUNG LUCIUS and LAVINIA running after him
and the boy flies from her with his books under his arm
Enter TITUS and MARCUS
BOY Help grandsire help my aunt Lavinia
Follows me everywhere I know not why
Good uncle Marcus see how swift she comes
Alas sweet aunt I know not what you mean
MARCUS Stand by me Lucius do not fear thine aunt
TITUS She loves thee boy too well to do thee harm
BOY Ay when my father was in Rome she did
MARCUS What means my niece Lavinia by these signs
TITUS Fear her not Lucius somewhat doth she mean
See Lucius see how much she makes of thee
Somewhither would she have thee go with her
Ah boy Cornelia never with more care
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
MARCUS Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus
BOY My lord I know not I nor can I guess
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft
Extremity of griefs would make men mad
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
Ran mad for sorrow That made me to fear
Although my lord I know my noble aunt
And would not but in fury fright my youth
Causeless perhaps But pardon me sweet aunt
And madam if my uncle Marcus go
I will most willingly attend your ladyship
TITUS How now Lavinia Marcus what means this
Some book there is that she desires to see
Come and take choice of all my library
And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus
MARCUS I think she means that there were more than one
Confederate in the fact ay more there was
Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge
TITUS Lucius what book is that she tosseth so
My mother gave it me
TITUS Soft So busily she turns the leaves Help her
What would she find Lavinia shall I read
This is the tragic tale of Philomel
And rape I fear was root of thy annoy
MARCUS See brother see Note how she quotes the leaves
See see
By nature made for murders and for rapes
MARCUS O why should nature build so foul a den
Unless the gods delight in tragedies
TITUS Give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed
Or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst
MARCUS Sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me
Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury
Inspire me that I may this treason find
My lord look here Look here Lavinia
This sandy plot is plain guide if thou canst
This after me I have writ my name
Without the help of any hand at all
Write thou good niece and here display at last
What God will have discovered for revenge
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain
That we may know the traitors and the truth
O do ye read my lord what she hath writ
MARCUS What what the lustful sons of Tamora
Performers of this heinous bloody deed
TITUS Magni Dominator poli
Tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides
MARCUS O calm thee gentle lord although I know
There is enough written upon this earth
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims
My lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneel
And father of that chaste dishonoured dame
That we will prosecute by good advice
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths
And see their blood or die with this reproach
The dam will wake and if she wind ye once
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back
And when he sleeps will she do what she list
You are a young huntsman Marcus let alone
And come I will go get a leaf of brass
And with a gad of steel will write these words
And lay it by The angry northern wind
BOY I say my lord that if I were a man
For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome
For his ungrateful country done the like
BOY And uncle so will I an if I live
TITUS Come go with me into mine armoury
Presents that I intend to send them both
BOY Ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire
Lavinia come Marcus look to my house
Exeunt TITUS LAVINIA and YOUNG LUCIUS
MARCUS O heavens can you hear a good man groan
And not relent or not compassion him
Marcus attend him in his ecstasy
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
But yet so just that he will not revenge
Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus                 Exit
SCENE II
Rome The palace
Enter AARON DEMETRIUS and CHIRON at one door and at the other door
YOUNG LUCIUS and another with a bundle of weapons and verses writ upon them
He hath some message to deliver us
AARON Ay some mad message from his mad grandfather
BOY My lords with all the humbleness I may
The goodliest weapons of his armoury
To gratify your honourable youth
The hope of Rome for so he bid me say
And so I do and with his gifts present
Your lordships that whenever you have need
You may be armed and appointed well
Exeunt YOUNG LUCIUS and attendant
I read it in the grammar long ago
That wound beyond their feeling to the quick
But were our witty Empress well afoot
Led us to Rome strangers and more than so
Captives to be advanced to this height
It did me good before the palace gate
DEMETRIUS But me more good to see so great a lord
Basely insinuate and send us gifts
AARON Had he not reason Lord Demetrius
Did you not use his daughter very friendly
DEMETRIUS I would we had a thousand Roman dames
At such a bay by turn to serve our lust
CHIRON A charitable wish and full of love
AARON Here lacks but your mother for to say amen
CHIRON And that would she for twenty thousand more
DEMETRIUS Come let us go and pray to all the gods
For our beloved mother in her pains
CHIRON Belike for joy the Emperor hath a son
DEMETRIUS Soft who comes here
Enter NURSE with a blackamoor CHILD
NURSE Good morrow lords
O tell me did you see Aaron the Moor
Here Aaron is and what with Aaron now
NURSE O gentle Aaron we are all undone
Now help or woe betide thee evermore
AARON Why what a caterwauling dost thou keep
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms
She is delivered lord she is delivered
AARON To whom
AARON Well God give her good rest What hath he sent her
NURSE A devil
A joyful issue
NURSE A joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue
Here is the babe as loathsome as a toad
The Empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal
AARON Zounds ye whore Is black so base a hue
Sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure
DEMETRIUS Villain what hast thou done
AARON That which thou canst not undo
CHIRON Thou hast undone our mother
AARON Villain I have done thy mother
DEMETRIUS And therein hellish dog thou hast undone her
CHIRON It shall not live
AARON It shall not die
NURSE Aaron it must the mother wills it so
AARON What must it nurse Then let no man but I
Do execution on my flesh and blood
Nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it
AARON Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up
Stay murderous villains will you kill your brother
Now by the burning tapers of the sky
That shone so brightly when this boy was got
I tell you younglings not Enceladus
Nor great Alcides nor the god of war
In that it scorns to bear another hue
For all the water in the ocean
Although she lave them hourly in the flood
Tell the Empress from me I am of age
DEMETRIUS Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus
AARON My mistress is my mistress this my self
The vigour and the picture of my youth
This before all the world do I prefer
This maugre all the world will I keep safe
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome
CHIRON Rome will despise her for this foul escape
NURSE The Emperor in his rage will doom her death
CHIRON I blush to think upon this ignomy
Fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing
The close enacts and counsels of thy heart
Look how the black slave smiles upon the father
He is your brother lords sensibly fed
And from your womb where you imprisoned were
He is enfranchised and come to light
Nay he is your brother by the surer side
Although my seal be stamped in his face
NURSE Aaron what shall I say unto the Empress
DEMETRIUS Advise thee Aaron what is to be done
And we will all subscribe to thy advice
Save thou the child so we may all be safe
AARON Then sit we down and let us all consult
My son and I will have the wind of you
Keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety
DEMETRIUS How many women saw this child of his
AARON Why so brave lords When we join in league
I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor
The chafed boar the mountain lioness
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms
But say again how many saw the child
NURSE Cornelia the midwife and myself
And no one else but the delivered Empress
AARON The Emperess the midwife and yourself
Weeke weeke
So cries a pig prepared to the spit
And now be it known to you my full intent
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed
His child is like to her fair as you are
Go pack with him and give the mother gold
And tell them both the circumstance of all
And substituted in the place of mine
To calm this tempest whirling in the court
And let the Emperor dandle him for his own
Hark ye lords You see I have given her physic
And you must needs bestow her funeral
The fields are near and you are gallant grooms
This done see that you take no longer days
But send the midwife presently to me
The midwife and the nurse well made away
Then let the ladies tattle what they please
CHIRON Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air
With secrets
DEMETRIUS For this care of Tamora
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee
Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the dead NURSE
AARON Now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms
For it is you that puts us to our shifts
And feed on curds and whey and suck the goat
And cabin in a cave and bring you up
To be a warrior and command a camp
Exit with the CHILD
SCENE III
Rome A public place
Enter TITUS bearing arrows with letters on the ends of them
with him MARCUS YOUNG LUCIUS and other gentlemen
PUBLIUS SEMPRONIUS and CAIUS with bows
TITUS Come Marcus come kinsmen this is the way
Sir boy let me see your archery
Terras Astrea reliquit
Sirs take you to your tools You cousins shall
Go sound the ocean and cast your nets
Happily you may catch her in the sea
No Publius and Sempronius you must do it
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth
I pray you deliver him this petition
Tell him it is for justice and for aid
And that it comes from old Andronicus
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome
Ah Rome Well well I made thee miserable
Go get you gone and pray be careful all
And kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice
MARCUS O Publius is not this a heavy case
To see thy noble uncle thus distract
PUBLIUS Therefore my lords it highly us concerns
And feed his humour kindly as we may
Till time beget some careful remedy
MARCUS Kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy
Join with the Goths and with revengeful war
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine
TITUS Publius how now How now my masters
What have you met with her
PUBLIUS No my good lord but Pluto sends you word
If you will have Revenge from hell you shall
He thinks with Jove in heaven or somewhere else
So that perforce you must needs stay a time
TITUS He doth me wrong to feed me with delays
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels
Marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we
But metal Marcus steel to the very back
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear
We will solicit heaven and move the gods
To send down justice for to wreak our wrongs
Come to this gear You are a good archer Marcus
You were as good to shoot against the wind
To it boy Marcus loose when I bid
Of my word I have written to effect
MARCUS Kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court
We will afflict the Emperor in his pride
MARCUS My lord I aim a mile beyond the moon
Your letter is with Jupiter by this
TITUS Ha ha
Publius Publius hast thou done
MARCUS This was the sport my lord when Publius shot
But give them to his master for a present
TITUS Why there it goes God give his lordship joy
Enter the CLOWN with a basket and two pigeons in it
News news from heaven Marcus the post is come
Sirrah what tidings Have you any letters
Shall I have justice What says Jupiter
TITUS But what says Jupiter I ask thee
CLOWN Alas sir I know not Jupiter I never drank with him in all
my life
TITUS Why villain art not thou the carrier
CLOWN Ay of my pigeons sir nothing else
TITUS Why didst thou not come from heaven
CLOWN From heaven Alas sir I never came there God forbid I
should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days Why I am
going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs to take up a matter
MARCUS Why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your
oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the Emperor from you
TITUS Tell me can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a
grace
CLOWN Nay truly sir I could never say grace in all my life
TITUS Sirrah come hither Make no more ado
But give your pigeons to the Emperor
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands
Give me pen and ink Sirrah can you with a grace deliver up a
supplication
CLOWN Ay sir
TITUS Then here is a supplication for you And when you come to
him at the first approach you must kneel then kiss his foot
be at hand sir see you do it bravely
CLOWN I warrant you sir let me alone
TITUS Sirrah hast thou a knife Come let me see it
Here Marcus fold it in the oration
For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant
And when thou hast given it to the Emperor
Knock at my door and tell me what he says
CLOWN God be with you sir I will
TITUS Come Marcus let us go Publius follow me     Exeunt
SCENE IV
Rome Before the palace
Enter the EMPEROR and the EMPRESS and her two sons DEMETRIUS and CHIRON
LORDS and others The EMPEROR brings the arrows in his hand that TITUS
shot at him
SATURNINUS Why lords what wrongs are these Was ever seen
An emperor in Rome thus overborne
Troubled confronted thus and for the extent
My lords you know as know the mightful gods
However these disturbers of our peace
But even with law against the wilful sons
Of old Andronicus And what an if
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks
His fits his frenzy and his bitterness
And now he writes to heaven for his redress
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome
And blazoning our unjustice every where
A goodly humour is it not my lords
As who would say in Rome no justice were
But if I live his feigned ecstasies
Shall be no shelter to these outrages
But he and his shall know that justice lives
TAMORA My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine
Lord of my life commander of my thoughts
And rather comfort his distressed plight
Than prosecute the meanest or the best
Then is all safe the anchor in the port
Enter CLOWN
How now good fellow Wouldst thou speak with us
CLOWN Yes forsooth an your mistriship be Emperial
TAMORA Empress I am but yonder sits the Emperor
brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here
SATURNINUS Go take him away and hang him presently
CLOWN How much money must I have
SATURNINUS Despiteful and intolerable wrongs
Shall I endure this monstrous villainy
I know from whence this same device proceeds
That died by law for murder of our brother
Have by my means been butchered wrongfully
Go drag the villain hither by the hair
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me
Enter NUNTIUS AEMILIUS
What news with thee Aemilius
AEMILIUS Arm my lords Rome never had more cause
The Goths have gathered head and with a power
Of high resolved men bent to the spoil
They hither march amain under conduct
Of Lucius son to old Andronicus
Who threats in course of this revenge to do
As much as ever Coriolanus did
SATURNINUS Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths
These tidings nip me and I hang the head
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms
Ay now begins our sorrows to approach
TAMORA Why should you fear Is not your city strong
SATURNINUS Ay but the citizens favour Lucius
And will revolt from me to succour him
TAMORA King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name
The eagle suffers little birds to sing
And is not careful what they mean thereby
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
He can at pleasure stint their melody
Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome
Then cheer thy spirit for know thou Emperor
I will enchant the old Andronicus
With words more sweet and yet more dangerous
When as the one is wounded with the bait
The other rotted with delicious feed
SATURNINUS But he will not entreat his son for us
TAMORA If Tamora entreat him then he will
For I can smooth and fill his aged ears
With golden promises that were his heart
Almost impregnable his old ears deaf
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue
Say that the Emperor requests a parley
Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting
SATURNINUS Aemilius do this message honourably
And if he stand on hostage for his safety
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best
AEMILIUS Your bidding shall I do effectually            Exit
TAMORA Now will I to that old Andronicus
And temper him with all the art I have
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths
And now sweet Emperor be blithe again
And bury all thy fear in my devices
SATURNINUS Then go successantly and plead to him
Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Plains near Rome
Enter LUCIUS with an army of GOTHS with drums and colours
LUCIUS Approved warriors and my faithful friends
I have received letters from great Rome
Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor
And how desirous of our sight they are
Therefore great lords be as your titles witness
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath
Let him make treble satisfaction
FIRST GOTH Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus
Whose name was once our terror now our comfort
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt
ALL THE GOTHS And as he saith so say we all with him
LUCIUS I humbly thank him and I thank you all
But who comes here led by a lusty Goth
Enter a GOTH leading AARON with his CHILD in his arms
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery
And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
Upon the wasted building suddenly
I heard a child cry underneath a wall
I made unto the noise when soon I heard
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art
Villain thou mightst have been an emperor
To use as you think needful of the man
LUCIUS O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil
Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word
A halter soldiers Hang him on this tree
And by his side his fruit of bastardy
AARON Touch not the boy he is of royal blood
LUCIUS Too like the sire for ever being good
Get me a ladder
AARON Lucius save the child
And bear it from me to the Emperess
That highly may advantage thee to hear
If thou wilt not befall what may befall
AARON An if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius
For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres
Acts of black night abominable deeds
Complots of mischief treason villainies
And this shall all be buried in my death
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live
LUCIUS Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live
AARON Swear that he shall and then I will begin
LUCIUS Who should I swear by Thou believest no god
That granted how canst thou believe an oath
AARON What if I do not as indeed I do not
Yet for I know thou art religious
And hast a thing within thee called conscience
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies
Which I have seen thee careful to observe
Therefore I urge thy oath For that I know
An idiot holds his bauble for a god
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears
To save my boy to nourish and bring him up
Or else I will discover nought to thee
LUCIUS Even by my god I swear to thee I will
AARON First know thou I begot him on the Empress
LUCIUS O most insatiate and luxurious woman
AARON Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon
Trim sport for them which had the doing of it
LUCIUS O barbarous beastly villains like thyself
AARON Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them
That codding spirit had they from their mother
As sure a card as ever won the set
As true a dog as ever fought at head
Well let my deeds be witness of my worth
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay
I wrote the letter that thy father found
Confederate with the Queen and her two sons
And what not done that thou hast cause to rue
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it
And when I had it drew myself apart
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter
I pried me through the crevice of a wall
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his
And when I told the Empress of this sport
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses
GOTH What canst thou say all this and never blush
AARON Ay like a black dog as the saying is
LUCIUS Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds
AARON Ay that I had not done a thousand more
Wherein I did not some notorious ill
As kill a man or else devise his death
Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself
Set deadly enmity between two friends
And bid the owners quench them with their tears
Even when their sorrows almost was forgot
And on their skins as on the bark of trees
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters
Tut I have done a thousand dreadful things
As willingly as one would kill a fly
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand more
LUCIUS Bring down the devil for he must not die
So sweet a death as hanging presently
AARON If there be devils would I were a devil
To live and burn in everlasting fire
So I might have your company in hell
But to torment you with my bitter tongue
LUCIUS Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more
Enter AEMILIUS
GOTH My lord there is a messenger from Rome
Desires to be admitted to your presence
LUCIUS Let him come near
AEMILIUS Lord Lucius and you Princes of the Goths
The Roman Emperor greets you all by me
And for he understands you are in arms
Willing you to demand your hostages
FIRST GOTH What says our general
LUCIUS Aemilius let the Emperor give his pledges
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus
And we will come March away                         Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter TAMORA and her two sons DEMETRIUS and CHIRON disguised
TAMORA Thus in this strange and sad habiliment
I will encounter with Andronicus
And say I am Revenge sent from below
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs
Knock at his study where they say he keeps
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him
And work confusion on his enemies
They knock and TITUS opens his study door above
TITUS Who doth molest my contemplation
Is it your trick to make me ope the door
That so my sad decrees may fly away
And all my study be to no effect
See here in bloody lines I have set down
And what is written shall be executed
TAMORA Titus I am come to talk with thee
TITUS No not a word How can I grace my talk
Wanting a hand to give it that accord
Thou hast the odds of me therefore no more
TAMORA If thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me
TITUS I am not mad I know thee well enough
Witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines
Witness these trenches made by grief and care
Witness the tiring day and heavy night
Witness all sorrow that I know thee well
For our proud Empress mighty Tamora
Is not thy coming for my other hand
TAMORA Know thou sad man I am not Tamora
She is thy enemy and I thy friend
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes
Confer with me of murder and of death
No vast obscurity or misty vale
Where bloody murder or detested rape
Can couch for fear but I will find them out
Revenge which makes the foul offender quake
TITUS Art thou Revenge and art thou sent to me
To be a torment to mine enemies
TAMORA I am therefore come down and welcome me
TITUS Do me some service ere I come to thee
Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands
Stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels
And whirl along with thee about the globes
Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away
And find out murderers in their guilty caves
And when thy car is loaden with their heads
I will dismount and by thy waggon wheel
Trot like a servile footman all day long
Until his very downfall in the sea
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there
TAMORA These are my ministers and come with me
TAMORA Rape and Murder therefore called so
And you the Empress But we worldly men
Have miserable mad mistaking eyes
O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee
I will embrace thee in it by and by
TAMORA This closing with him fits his lunacy
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge
And being credulous in this mad thought
And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths
Or at the least make them his enemies
See here he comes and I must ply my theme
Enter TITUS below
TITUS Long have I been forlorn and all for thee
Welcome dread Fury to my woeful house
Rapine and Murder you are welcome too
How like the Empress and her sons you are
Well are you fitted had you but a Moor
Could not all hell afford you such a devil
For well I wot the Empress never wags
But in her company there is a Moor
And would you represent our queen aright
It were convenient you had such a devil
But welcome as you are What shall we do
TAMORA What wouldst thou have us do Andronicus
CHIRON Show me a villain that hath done a rape
TAMORA Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong
And I will be revenged on them all
TITUS Look round about the wicked streets of Rome
Go thou with him and when it is thy hap
To find another that is like to thee
Good Rapine stab him he is a ravisher
There is a queen attended by a Moor
Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion
For up and down she doth resemble thee
I pray thee do on them some violent death
They have been violent to me and mine
But would it please thee good Andronicus
Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths
And bid him come and banquet at thy house
When he is here even at thy solemn feast
I will bring in the Empress and her sons
The Emperor himself and all thy foes
And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart
What says Andronicus to this device
Enter MARCUS
Go gentle Marcus to thy nephew Lucius
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths
Bid him repair to me and bring with him
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are
Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too
Feast at my house and he shall feast with them
This do thou for my love and so let him
MARCUS This will I do and soon return again            Exit
TAMORA Now will I hence about thy business
And take my ministers along with me
TITUS Nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius
with him
Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
Yield to his humour smooth and speak him fair
And tarry with him till I turn again
DEMETRIUS Madam depart at pleasure leave us here
TAMORA Farewell Andronicus Revenge now goes
To lay a complot to betray thy foes
TITUS I know thou dost and sweet Revenge farewell
Exit TAMORA
TITUS Tut I have work enough for you to do
Publius come hither Caius and Valentine
Enter PUBLIUS CAIUS and VALENTINE
PUBLIUS What is your will
TITUS Know you these two
Caius and Valentine lay hands on them
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour
And now I find it therefore bind them sure
And stop their mouths if they begin to cry             Exit
PUBLIUS And therefore do we what we are commanded
Stop close their mouths let them not speak a word
Is he sure bound Look that you bind them fast
with a knife and LAVINIA with a basin
TITUS Come come Lavinia look thy foes are bound
Sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me
But let them hear what fearful words I utter
O villains Chiron and Demetrius
My hand cut off and made a merry jest
Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear
Than hands or tongue her spotless chastity
What would you say if I should let you speak
Villains for shame you could not beg for grace
Hark wretches how I mean to martyr you
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats
The basin that receives your guilty blood
You know your mother means to feast with me
And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad
Hark villains I will grind your bones to dust
And of the paste a coffin I will rear
And make two pasties of your shameful heads
And bid that strumpet your unhallowed dam
Like to the earth swallow her own increase
This is the feast that I have bid her to
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on
And now prepare your throats Lavinia come
Receive the blood and when that they are dead
Let me go grind their bones to powder small
And with this hateful liquor temper it
Come come be every one officious
To make this banquet which I wish may prove
Now bring them in for I will play the cook
And see them ready against their mother comes
Exeunt bearing the dead bodies
SCENE III
Enter Lucius MARCUS and the GOTHS with AARON prisoner
and his CHILD in the arms of an attendant
That I repair to Rome I am content
FIRST GOTH And ours with thine befall what fortune will
LUCIUS Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor
This ravenous tiger this accursed devil
For testimony of her foul proceedings
And see the ambush of our friends be strong
I fear the Emperor means no good to us
AARON Some devil whisper curses in my ear
And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
The venomous malice of my swelling heart
LUCIUS Away inhuman dog unhallowed slave
Sirs help our uncle to convey him in
Exeunt GOTHS with AARON Flourish within
The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand
Sound trumpets Enter SATURNINUS and
TAMORA with AEMILIUS TRIBUNES SENATORS and others
SATURNINUS What hath the firmament more suns than one
LUCIUS What boots it thee to can thyself a sun
These quarrels must be quietly debated
The feast is ready which the careful Titus
For peace for love for league and good to Rome
Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places
SATURNINUS Marcus we will
Trumpets sounding enter TITUS
like a cook placing the dishes and LAVINIA
with a veil over her face also YOUNG LUCIUS and others
TITUS Welcome my lord welcome dread Queen
Welcome ye warlike Goths welcome Lucius
And welcome all Although the cheer be poor
TITUS Because I would be sure to have all well
To entertain your Highness and your Empress
TAMORA We are beholding to you good Andronicus
TITUS An if your Highness knew my heart you were
My lord the Emperor resolve me this
Was it well done of rash Virginius
To slay his daughter with his own right hand
SATURNINUS It was Andronicus
TITUS Your reason mighty lord
SATURNINUS Because the girl should not survive her shame
And by her presence still renew his sorrows
TITUS A reason mighty strong and effectual
A pattern precedent and lively warrant
For me most wretched to perform the like
SATURNINUS What hast thou done unnatural and unkind
I am as woeful as Virginius was
And have a thousand times more cause than he
To do this outrage and it now is done
TAMORA Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus
SATURNINUS Go fetch them hither to us presently
TITUS Why there they are both baked in this pie
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred
SATURNINUS Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed
O let me teach you how to knit again
This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf
These broken limbs again into one body
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself
And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway
Do shameful execution on herself
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age
Grave witnesses of true experience
Cannot induce you to attend my words
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
The story of that baleful burning night
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief
But floods of tears will drown my oratory
When it should move ye to attend me most
And force you to commiseration
While I stand by and weep to hear him speak
LUCIUS Then gracious auditory be it known to you
And they it were that ravished our sister
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded
And sent her enemies unto the grave
Lastly myself unkindly banished
I am the turned forth be it known to you
Alas you know I am no vaunter I
My scars can witness dumb although they are
That my report is just and full of truth
But soft methinks I do digress too much
Citing my worthless praise O pardon me
For when no friends are by men praise themselves
MARCUS Now is my turn to speak Behold the child
Of this was Tamora delivered
The issue of an irreligious Moor
Chief architect and plotter of these woes
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
These wrongs unspeakable past patience
Or more than any living man could bear
Now have you heard the truth what say you Romans
Have we done aught amiss show us wherein
And from the place where you behold us pleading
The poor remainder of Andronici
Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves
And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls
And make a mutual closure of our house
Speak Romans speak and if you say we shall
Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall
AEMILIUS Come come thou reverend man of Rome
And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand
Lucius our Emperor for well I know
The common voice do cry it shall be so
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
As punishment for his most wicked life          Exeunt some
attendants LUCIUS MARCUS and the others descend
LUCIUS Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so
But gentle people give me aim awhile
For nature puts me to a heavy task
Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk
The last true duties of thy noble son
MARCUS Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips
O were the sum of these that I should pay
Countless and infinite yet would I pay them
LUCIUS Come hither boy come come come and learn of us
Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow
Many a story hath he told to thee
And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind
And talk of them when he was dead and gone
MARCUS How many thousand times hath these poor lips
O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss
Bid him farewell commit him to the grave
Do them that kindness and take leave of them
Would I were dead so you did live again
O Lord I cannot speak to him for weeping
My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth
A ROMAN You sad Andronici have done with woes
Give sentence on the execrable wretch
That hath been breeder of these dire events
There let him stand and rave and cry for food
If any one relieves or pities him
For the offence he dies This is our doom
AARON Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb
I am no baby I that with base prayers
I should repent the evils I have done
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
Would I perform if I might have my will
If one good deed in all my life I did
I do repent it from my very soul
LUCIUS Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
As for that ravenous tiger Tamora
No funeral rite nor man in mourning weed
No mournful bell shall ring her burial
But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey
Her life was beastly and devoid of pity
And being dead let birds on her take pity           Exeunt

In Troy there lies the scene From isles of Greece
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships
Fraught with the ministers and instruments
Of cruel war Sixty and nine that wore
Put forth toward Phrygia and their vow is made
To ransack Troy within whose strong immures
To Tenedos they come
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
Dardan and Tymbria Helias Chetas Troien
And Antenorides with massy staples
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
Sperr up the sons of Troy

ACT I SCENE 1
Enter TROILUS armed and PANDARUS
Why should I war without the walls of Troy
That find such cruel battle here within
Each Troyan that is master of his heart
Let him to field Troilus alas hath none
TROILUS The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant
Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance
Less valiant than the virgin in the night
PANDARUS Well I have told you enough of this for my part
out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding
TROILUS Have I not tarried
PANDARUS Ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting
TROILUS Have I not tarried
PANDARUS Ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening
TROILUS Still have I tarried
of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too
or you may chance to burn your lips
So traitor then she comes when she is thence
look or any woman else
TROILUS I was about to tell thee when my heart
As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me
I have as when the sun doth light a storm
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness
my part she is my kinswoman I would not as they term it
praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as
Reply not in how many fathoms deep
Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice
Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand
In whose comparison all whites are ink
Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure
But saying thus instead of oil and balm
The knife that made it
PANDARUS I speak no more than truth
TROILUS Thou dost not speak so much
mends in her own hands
TROILUS Good Pandarus How now Pandarus
PANDARUS I have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of
her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but
small thanks for my labour
TROILUS What art thou angry Pandarus What with me
Helen An she were not kin to me she would be as fair a Friday
as Helen is on Sunday But what care I I care not an she were a
TROILUS Say I she is not fair
TROILUS Pandarus
PANDARUS Not I
TROILUS Sweet Pandarus
PANDARUS Pray you speak no more to me I will leave all
as I found it and there an end               Exit Sound alarum
TROILUS Peace you ungracious clamours Peace rude sounds
Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair
When with your blood you daily paint her thus
I cannot fight upon this argument
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar
What Cressid is what Pandar and what we
Her bed is India there she lies a pearl
Between our Ilium and where she resides
Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar
Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark
Alarum Enter AENEAS
AENEAS How now Prince Troilus Wherefore not afield
For womanish it is to be from thence
AENEAS That Paris is returned home and hurt
TROILUS By whom Aeneas
AENEAS Troilus by Menelaus
But to the sport abroad Are you bound thither
AENEAS In all swift haste
TROILUS Come go we then together                          Exeunt
ACT I SCENE 2
Troy A street
Enter CRESSIDA and her man ALEXANDER
CRESSIDA Who were those went by
ALEXANDER Queen Hecuba and Helen
CRESSIDA And whither go they
ALEXANDER Up to the eastern tower
Whose height commands as subject all the vale
To see the battle Hector whose patience
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer
And like as there were husbandry in war
And to the field goes he where every flower
Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
CRESSIDA What was his cause of anger
ALEXANDER The noise goes this there is among the Greeks
A lord of Troyan blood nephew to Hector
They call him Ajax
CRESSIDA Good and what of him
ALEXANDER They say he is a very man per se
And stands alone
CRESSIDA So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no
legs
particular additions he is as valiant as a lion churlish as the
with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he
hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind
Argus all eyes and no sight
CRESSIDA But how should this man that makes me smile make Hector
angry
struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
kept Hector fasting and waking
Enter PANDARUS
CRESSIDA Who comes here
ALEXANDER Madam your uncle Pandarus
ALEXANDER As may be in the world lady
CRESSIDA Good morrow uncle Pandarus
CRESSIDA This morning uncle
and gone ere you came to Ilium Helen was not up was she
CRESSIDA Hector was gone but Helen was not up
CRESSIDA That were we talking of and of his anger
PANDARUS Was he angry
CRESSIDA So he says here
come far behind him let them take heed of Troilus I can tell
them that too
CRESSIDA What is he angry too
PANDARUS Who Troilus Troilus is the better man of the two
PANDARUS What not between Troilus and Hector Do you know a man
if you see him
CRESSIDA Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him
PANDARUS Well I say Troilus is Troilus
CRESSIDA Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector
PANDARUS No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees
PANDARUS Himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were
CRESSIDA So he is
PANDARUS Condition I had gone barefoot to India
CRESSIDA He is not Hector
Well the gods are above time must friend or end Well Troilus
well I would my heart were in her body No Hector is not a
better man than Troilus
CRESSIDA Excuse me
PANDARUS He is elder
CRESSIDA Pardon me pardon me
year
CRESSIDA He shall not need it if he have his own
PANDARUS Nor his qualities
CRESSIDA No matter
PANDARUS Nor his beauty
CRESSIDA No but brown
PANDARUS Faith to say truth brown and not brown
CRESSIDA To say the truth true and not true
CRESSIDA Why Paris hath colour enough
PANDARUS So he has
above his complexion is higher than his he having colour
enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good
Troilus for a copper nose
PANDARUS I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris
particulars therein to a total
PANDARUS Why he is very young and yet will he within three pound
lift as much as his brother Hector
CRESSIDA Is he so young a man and so old a lifter
PANDARUS But to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and
CRESSIDA Juno have mercy How came it cloven
him better than any man in all Phrygia
CRESSIDA O he smiles valiantly
PANDARUS Does he not
PANDARUS Why go to then But to prove to you that Helen loves
PANDARUS Troilus Why he esteems her no more than I esteem an
addle egg
CRESSIDA If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
PANDARUS I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
confess
CRESSIDA Without the rack
PANDARUS And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin
CRESSIDA Alas poor chin Many a wart is richer
CRESSIDA With millstones
CRESSIDA But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
CRESSIDA At what was all this laughing
chin
answer
CRESSIDA What was his answer
CRESSIDA This is her question
CRESSIDA So let it now for it has been a great while going by
CRESSIDA So I do

eye to boot
CRESSIDA Here comes more
Common soldiers pass
PANDARUS Asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran
porridge after meat I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus
crows and daws I had rather be such a man as Troilus than
Agamemnon and all Greece
CRESSIDA There is amongst the Greeks Achilles a better man than
Troilus
PANDARUS Achilles A drayman a porter a very camel
CRESSIDA Well well
PANDARUS Well well Why have you any discretion Have you any
eyes Do you know what a man is Is not birth beauty good
shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth
liberality and such like the spice and salt that season a man
PANDARUS You are such a woman A man knows not at what ward you
lie
CRESSIDA Upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend
my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to
defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these
wards I lie at at a thousand watches
PANDARUS Say one of your watches
chiefest of them too If I cannot ward what I would not have hit
I can watch you for telling how I took the blow unless it swell
PANDARUS You are such another
BOY Sir my lord would instantly speak with you
PANDARUS Where
BOY At your own house there he unarms him
PANDARUS Good boy tell him I come                       Exit Boy
I doubt he be hurt Fare ye well good niece
CRESSIDA Adieu uncle
PANDARUS I will be with you niece by and by
CRESSIDA To bring uncle
PANDARUS Ay a token from Troilus
CRESSIDA By the same token you are a bawd
Exit PANDARUS
Yet hold I off Women are angels wooing
That she was never yet that ever knew
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear                 Exit
ACT I SCENE 3
Sennet Enter AGAMEMNON NESTOR ULYSSES DIOMEDES MENELAUS and others
AGAMEMNON Princes
The ample proposition that hope makes
In all designs begun on earth below
As knots by the conflux of meeting sap
Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain
Tortive and errant from his course of growth
Nor princes is it matter new to us
That we come short of our suppose so far
Sith every action that hath gone before
Whereof we have record trial did draw
Bias and thwart not answering the aim
And that unbodied figure of the thought
And call them shames which are indeed nought else
But the protractive trials of great Jove
To find persistive constancy in men
The fineness of which metal is not found
The wise and fool the artist and unread
But in the wind and tempest of her frown
Distinction with a broad and powerful fan
Puffing at all winnows the light away
And what hath mass or matter by itself
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled
NESTOR With due observance of thy godlike seat
Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply
Thy latest words In the reproof of chance
Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
Upon her patient breast making their way
With those of nobler bulk
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
The gentle Thetis and anon behold
Bounding between the two moist elements
Or made a toast for Neptune Even so
In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks
Retorts to chiding fortune
ULYSSES Agamemnon
Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece
Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit
In whom the tempers and the minds of all
Besides the applause and approbation
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
Should hold up high in brass and such again
On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears
Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak
That matter needless of importless burden
Divide thy lips than we are confident
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws
We shall hear music wit and oracle
ULYSSES Troy yet upon his basis had been down
But for these instances
The specialty of rule hath been neglected
And look how many Grecian tents do stand
Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions
When that the general is not like the hive
To whom the foragers shall all repair
What honey is expected Degree being vizarded
The heavens themselves the planets and this centre
Observe degree priority and place
Insisture course proportion season form
Office and custom in all line of order
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil
And posts like the commandment of a king
Sans check to good and bad But when the planets
In evil mixture to disorder wander
What plagues and what portents what mutiny
What raging of the sea shaking of earth
Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors
Divert and crack rend and deracinate
The unity and married calm of states
Which is the ladder of all high designs
The enterprise is sick How could communities
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores
The primogenity and due of birth
Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels
But by degree stand in authentic place
Take but degree away untune that string
And hark what discord follows Each thing melts
In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
And make a sop of all this solid globe
Strength should be lord of imbecility
And the rude son should strike his father dead
Should lose their names and so should justice too
Then everything includes itself in power
Power into will will into appetite
And appetite an universal wolf
So doubly seconded with will and power
Must make perforce an universal prey
And last eat up himself Great Agamemnon
This chaos when degree is suffocate
Follows the choking
And this neglection of degree it is
That by a pace goes backward with a purpose
By him one step below he by the next
That next by him beneath so ever step
Of his superior grows to an envious fever
Of pale and bloodless emulation
Not her own sinews To end a tale of length
Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength
The fever whereof all our power is sick
AGAMEMNON The nature of the sickness found Ulysses
What is the remedy
ULYSSES The great Achilles whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host
Having his ear full of his airy fame
Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
Breaks scurril jests
He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon
Thy topless deputation he puts on
And like a strutting player whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks
Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause
Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard
Of parallels as like Vulcan and his wife
And then forsooth the faint defects of age
Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit
Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport
Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all
All our abilities gifts natures shapes
Severals and generals of grace exact
Achievements plots orders preventions
Excitements to the field or speech for truce
Success or loss what is or is not serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes
Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns
In such a rein in full as proud a place
As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him
Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war
Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint
To match us in comparisons with dirt
To weaken and discredit our exposure
How rank soever rounded in with danger
ULYSSES They tax our policy and call it cowardice
Count wisdom as no member of the war
Forestall prescience and esteem no act
But that of hand The still and mental parts
That do contrive how many hands shall strike
When fitness calls them on and know by measure
So that the ram that batters down the wall
For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise
They place before his hand that made the engine
Or those that with the fineness of their souls
By reason guide his execution
AGAMEMNON What trumpet Look Menelaus
MENELAUS From Troy
Enter AENEAS
AGAMEMNON What would you fore our tent
AGAMEMNON Even this
AENEAS May one that is a herald and a prince
Do a fair message to his kingly eyes
Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice
Call Agamemnon head and general
AENEAS Fair leave and large security How may
A stranger to those most imperial looks
Know them from eyes of other mortals
AGAMEMNON How
AENEAS Ay
I ask that I might waken reverence
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
Modest as Morning when she coldly eyes
The youthful Phoebus
Which is that god in office guiding men
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon
AGAMEMNON This Troyan scorns us or the men of Troy
Are ceremonious courtiers
But when they would seem soldiers they have galls
Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas
Peace Troyan lay thy finger on thy lips
The worthiness of praise distains his worth
But what the repining enemy commends
That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends
AGAMEMNON Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas
AENEAS Ay Greek that is my name
AGAMEMNON He hears nought privately that comes from Troy
AENEAS Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear
To set his sense on the attentive bent
And then to speak
AGAMEMNON Speak frankly as the wind
That thou shalt know Troyan he is awake
He tells thee so himself
AENEAS Trumpet blow loud
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents
And every Greek of mettle let him know
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud
We have great Agamemnon here in Troy
Is resty grown he bade me take a trumpet
And to this purpose speak Kings princes lords
That holds his honour higher than his ease
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril
That knows his valour and knows not his fear
That loves his mistress more than in confession
With truant vows to her own lips he loves
And dare avow her beauty and her worth
Hector in view of Troyans and of Greeks
Shall make it good or do his best to do it
He hath a lady wiser fairer truer
Than ever Greek did couple in his arms
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love
If any come Hector shall honour him
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
The splinter of a lance Even so much
AGAMEMNON This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas
If none of them have soul in such a kind
We left them all at home But we are soldiers
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove
That means not hath not or is not in love
If then one is or hath or means to be
That one meets Hector if none else I am he
NESTOR Tell him of Nestor one that was a man
But if there be not in our Grecian mould
One noble man that hath one spark of fire
To answer for his love tell him from me
And meeting him will tell him that my lady
Was fairer than his grandame and as chaste
As may be in the world His youth in flood
AENEAS Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth
ULYSSES Amen
AGAMEMNON Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand
To our pavilion shall I lead you first
Achilles shall have word of this intent
So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent
Yourself shall feast with us before you go
And find the welcome of a noble foe
Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR
ULYSSES Nestor
NESTOR What says Ulysses
ULYSSES I have a young conception in my brain
Be you my time to bring it to some shape
Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride
That hath to this maturity blown up
Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil
To overbulk us all
NESTOR Well and how
ULYSSES This challenge that the gallant Hector sends
However it is spread in general name
Relates in purpose only to Achilles
NESTOR True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance
Whose grossness little characters sum up
And in the publication make no strain
But that Achilles were his brain as barren
Pointing on him
ULYSSES And wake him to the answer think you
That can from Hector bring those honours off
Yet in this trial much opinion dwells
In this vile action for the success
Although particular shall give a scantling
Of good or bad unto the general
And in such indexes although small pricks
To their subsequent volumes there is seen
The baby figure of the giant mas
He that meets Hector issues from our choice
And choice being mutual act of all our souls
Makes merit her election and doth boil
Out of our virtues who miscarrying
What heart receives from hence a conquering part
To steel a strong opinion to themselves
In no less working than are swords and bows
Directive by the limbs
ULYSSES Give pardon to my speech
Let us like merchants show our foulest wares
Of the better yet to show shall show the better
By showing the worst first Do not consent
That ever Hector and Achilles meet
For both our honour and our shame in this
NESTOR I see them not with my old eyes What are they
ULYSSES What glory our Achilles shares from Hector
Were he not proud we all should wear with him
But he already is too insolent
And it were better parch in Afric sun
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes
Why then we do our main opinion crush
And by device let blockish Ajax draw
The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselves
Give him allowance for the better man
For that will physic the great Myrmidon
Who broils in loud applause and make him fall
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off
Yet go we under our opinion still
That we have better men But hit or miss
NESTOR Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice
And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
To Agamemnon Go we to him straight
Two curs shall tame each other pride alone

The Grecian camp
Enter Ajax and THERSITES
AJAX Thersites
AJAX Thersites
then Were not that a botchy core
AJAX Dog
THERSITES Then there would come some matter from him
I see none now
lord
into handsomeness
THERSITES I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but I
think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a
prayer without book Thou canst strike canst thou A red murrain
AJAX Toadstool learn me the proclamation
THERSITES Dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus
AJAX The proclamation
AJAX Do not porpentine do not my fingers itch
THERSITES I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the
scratching of thee I would make thee the loathsomest scab in
Greece When thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as
slow as another
AJAX I say the proclamation
THERSITES Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles and
thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at
AJAX Mistress Thersites
THERSITES Thou shouldst strike him
AJAX Cobloaf
THERSITES He would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a
sailor breaks a biscuit
THERSITES Do do
AJAX Thou stool for a witch
brain than I have in mine elbows an assinico may tutor thee You
scurvy valiant ass Thou art here but to thrash Troyans and thou
art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian
slave If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and tell
what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou
AJAX You dog
THERSITES You scurvy lord
THERSITES Mars his idiot Do rudeness do camel do do
Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
ACHILLES Why how now Ajax Wherefore do you thus
THERSITES You see him there do you
THERSITES Nay look upon him
THERSITES Nay but regard him well
ACHILLES Well why so I do
THERSITES But yet you look not well upon him for who some ever
you take him to be he is Ajax
ACHILLES I know that fool
THERSITES Ay but that fool knows not himself
AJAX Therefore I beat thee
THERSITES Lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters His
he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and
his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow This
ACHILLES What
ACHILLES Nay good Ajax
ACHILLES Nay I must hold you

PATROCLUS No more words Thersites peace
to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave
the faction of fools                                        Exit
PATROCLUS A good riddance
That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun
That hath a stomach and such a one that dare
AJAX Farewell Who shall answer him
man
AJAX O meaning you I will go learn more of it            Exeunt
ACT II SCENE 2
Enter PRIAM HECTOR TROILUS PARIS and HELENUS
PRIAM After so many hours lives speeches spent
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks
As honour loss of time travail expense
HECTOR Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
As far as toucheth my particular
Yet dread Priam
There is no lady of more softer bowels
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear
Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety
The beacon of the wise the tent that searches
Since the first sword was drawn about this question
If we have lost so many tenths of ours
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
Had it our name the value of one ten
The yielding of her up
TROILUS Fie fie my brother
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
Of common ounces Will you with counters sum
And buckle in a waist most fathomless
With spans and inches so diminutive
As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame
HELENUS No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons
You are so empty of them Should not our father
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons
Because your speech hath none that tells him so
TROILUS You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest
You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons
You know an enemy intends you harm
And reason flies the object of all harm
Who marvels then when Helenus beholds
A Grecian and his sword if he do set
The very wings of reason to his heels
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove
Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts
Make livers pale and lustihood deject
HECTOR Brother she is not worth what she doth cost
The keeping
HECTOR But value dwells not in particular will
It holds his estimate and dignity
And the will dotes that is attributive
To what infectiously itself affects
Is led on in the conduct of my will
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears
Of will and judgment how may I avoid
Although my will distaste what it elected
The wife I chose There can be no evasion
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
We do not throw in unrespective sieve
Because we now are full It was thought meet
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks
Your breath with full consent benied his sails
The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive
He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness
Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt
Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate
Richer than sea and land O theft most base
That in their country did them that disgrace
We fear to warrant in our native place
PRIAM What noise what shriek is this
HECTOR It is Cassandra
Enter CASSANDRA raving
CASSANDRA Cry Troyans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes
And I will fill them with prophetic tears
HECTOR Peace sister peace
Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry
Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes
A moiety of that mass of moan to come
Cry Troyans cry Practise your eyes with tears
Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand
Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all
Cry Troyans cry A Helen and a woe
Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go                  Exit
HECTOR Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains
Of divination in our sister work
Some touches of remorse or is your blood
So madly hot that no discourse of reason
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause
Can qualify the same
TROILUS Why brother Hector
We may not think the justness of each act
Such and no other than event doth form it
Nor once deject the courage of our minds
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
To make it gracious For my private part
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
To fight for and maintain
PARIS Else might the world convince of levity
As well my undertakings as your counsels
But I attest the gods your full consent
Gave wings to my propension and cut of
All fears attending on so dire a project
For what alas can these my single arms
To stand the push and enmity of those
This quarrel would excite Yet I protest
Were I alone to pass the difficulties
And had as ample power as I have will
Nor faint in the pursuit
PRIAM Paris you speak
Like one besotted on your sweet delights
You have the honey still but these the gall
So to be valiant is no praise at all
PARIS Sir I propose not merely to myself
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it
But I would have the soil of her fair rape
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me
Now to deliver her possession up
On terms of base compulsion Can it be
That so degenerate a strain as this
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
When Helen is defended nor none so noble
Where Helen is the subject Then I say
Well may we fight for her whom we know well
HECTOR Paris and Troilus you have both said well
And on the cause and question now in hand
Unlike young men whom Aristode thought
Unfit to hear moral philosophy
The reasons you allege do more conduce
Than to make up a free determination
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
Of any true decision Nature craves
What nearer debt in all humanity
Than wife is to the husband If this law
Of nature be corrupted through affection
And that great minds of partial indulgence
To their benumbed wills resist the same
To curb those raging appetites that are
Most disobedient and refractory
Of nature and of nations speak aloud
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong
My spritely brethren I propend to you
In resolution to keep Helen still
Upon our joint and several dignities
Were it not glory that we more affected
Than the performance of our heaving spleens
I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood
Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector
She is a theme of honour and renown
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds
Whose present courage may beat down our foes
And fame in time to come canonize us
For I presume brave Hector would not lose
As smiles upon the forehead of this action
HECTOR I am yours
You valiant offspring of great Priamus
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits
Whilst emulation in the army crept
This I presume will wake him                            Exeunt
ACT II SCENE 3
The Grecian camp Before the tent of ACHILLES
Enter THERSITES solus
THERSITES How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy
fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I
rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that
not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till
forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose
all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that
it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without
drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the
vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan
that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy
Enter PATROCLUS
rail
matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly
and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from
a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says
PATROCLUS What art thou devout Wast thou in prayer
THERSITES Ay the heavens hear me
PATROCLUS Amen
Enter ACHILLES
PATROCLUS Thersites my lord
ACHILLES Where where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my
digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so
Achilles
Thersites
THERSITES Thy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art
thou
PATROCLUS Thou must tell that knowest
ACHILLES O tell tell
Patroclus is a fool
PATROCLUS You rascal
THERSITES Peace fool I have not done
THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a
fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool
ACHILLES Derive this come
THERSITES Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a
fool to serve such a fool and this Patroclus is a fool positive
PATROCLUS Why am I a fool
THERSITES Make that demand of the Creator It suffices me thou
art Look you who comes here
Thersites                                                   Exit
THERSITES Here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery
emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on
the subject and war and lechery confound all               Exit
Enter AGAMEMNON ULYSSES NESTOR DIOMEDES
AJAX and CALCHAS
AGAMEMNON Where is Achilles
AGAMEMNON Let it be known to him that we are here
He shent our messengers and we lay by
Our appertainings visiting of him
Let him be told so lest perchance he think
We dare not move the question of our place
Or know not what we are
PATROCLUS I shall say so to him                              Exit
ULYSSES We saw him at the opening of his tent
He is not sick
pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord
NESTOR What moves Ajax thus to bay at him
ULYSSES Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him
NESTORWho Thersites
ULYSSES He
NESTOR Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument
Achilles
NESTOR All the better their fraction is more our wish than their
faction But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite
ULYSSES The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie
Here comes Patroclus
NESTOR No Achilles with him
ULYSSES The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs
are legs for necessity not for flexure
PATROCLUS Achilles bids me say he is much sorry
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
Did move your greatness and this noble state
To call upon him he hopes it is no other
But for your health and your digestion sake
AGAMEMNON Hear you Patroclus
We are too well acquainted with these answers
Cannot outfly our apprehensions
Much attribute he hath and much the reason
Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues
Not virtuously on his own part beheld
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss
Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish
Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him
We come to speak with him and you shall not sin
Than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on
Disguise the holy strength of their command
And underwrite in an observing kind
His humorous predominance yea watch
His pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if
The passage and whole carriage of this action
Rode on his tide Go tell him this and ad
That if he overhold his price so much
Not portable lie under this report
Bring action hither this cannot go to war
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
Before a sleeping giant Tell him so
PATROCLUS I shall and bring his answer presently            Exit
We come to speak with him Ulysses enter you
Exit ULYSSES
AJAX What is he more than another
AGAMEMNON No more than what he thinks he is
AJAX Is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a better
man than I am
AGAMEMNON No question
AJAX Will you subscribe his thought and say he is
AGAMEMNON No noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise
no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable
AJAX Why should a man be proud How doth pride grow I know not
what pride is
AGAMEMNON Your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the
fairer He that is proud eats up himself Pride is his own glass
his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself
but in the deed devours the deed in the praise
ULYSSES He doth rely on none
But carries on the stream of his dispose
Without observance or respect of any
AGAMEMNON Why will he not upon our fair request
Untent his person and share the air with us
And speaks not to himself but with a pride
And batters down himself What should I say
He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it
AGAMEMNON Let Ajax go to him
Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent
At your request a little from himself
ULYSSES O Agamemnon let it not be so
When they go from Achilles Shall the proud lord
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
And never suffers matter of the world
Enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve
Of that we hold an idol more than he
Nor by my will assubjugate his merit
As amply titled as Achilles is
By going to Achilles
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
With entertaining great Hyperion
This lord go to him Jupiter forbid
face
AGAMEMNON O no you shall not go
Let me go to him
ULYSSES Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel
AJAX A paltry insolent fellow
AJAX Can he not be sociable
patient
Shall pride carry it
pour in pour in his ambition is dry
NESTOR Our noble general do not do so
DIOMEDES You must prepare to fight without Achilles
I will be silent
NESTOR Wherefore should you so
He is not emulous as Achilles is
ULYSSES Know the whole world he is as valiant
AJAX A whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus
Would he were a Troyan
ULYSSES If he were proud
DIOMEDES Or covetous of praise
ULYSSES Ay or surly borne
ULYSSES Thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure
Praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck
Let Mars divide eternity in twain
And give him half and for thy vigour
To sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdom
Which like a bourn a pale a shore confines
He must he is he cannot but be wise
But pardon father Nestor were your days
You should not have the eminence of him
But be as Ajax
AJAX Shall I call you father
NESTOR Ay my good son
ULYSSES There is no tarrying here the hart Achilles
Keeps thicket Please it our great general
To call together all his state of war
We must with all our main of power stand fast
And cull their flower Ajax shall cope the best
AGAMEMNON Go we to council Let Achilles sleep
Light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep
Exeunt

PARIS Ay good now love love nothing but love
Love love nothing but love still love still more

These lovers cry O ho they die
Yet that which seems the wound to kill
Doth turn O ho to ha ha he
So dying love lives still
O ho a while but ha ha ha
PARIS He eats nothing but doves love and that breeds hot blood

To greet the warriors Sweet Helen I must woo you
To help unarm our Hector His stubborn buckles
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
Or force of Greekish sinews you shall do more
Yea what he shall receive of us in duty
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have
Yea overshines ourself
PARIS Sweet above thought I love thee                     Exeunt
ACT III SCENE 2
BOY No sir he stays for you to conduct him thither
Enter TROILUS
PANDARUS O here he comes How now how now
TROILUS Sirrah walk off                                 Exit Boy
PANDARUS Have you seen my cousin
TROILUS No Pandarus I stalk about her door
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
Staying for waftage O be thou my Charon
And give me swift transportance to these fields
Where I may wallow in the lily beds
And fly with me to Cressid
Exit
TROILUS I am giddy expectation whirls me round
That it enchants my sense what will it be
Swooning destruction or some joy too fine
For the capacity of my ruder powers
I fear it much and I do fear besides
That I shall lose distinction in my joys
As doth a battle when they charge on heaps
The enemy flying
witty now She does so blush and fetches her wind so short as
sparrow                                                     Exit
TROILUS Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse
And all my powers do their bestowing lose
The eye of majesty
tame must you Come your ways come your ways an you draw
sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you The
TROILUS You have bereft me of all words lady
Exit
CRESSIDA Will you walk in my lord
TROILUS What should they grant What makes this pretty abruption
What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our
love
CRESSIDA More dregs than water if my fears have eyes
TROILUS Fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly
CRESSIDA Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing
than blind reason stumbling without fear To fear the worst oft
cures the worse
there is presented no monster
CRESSIDA Nor nothing monstrous neither
TROILUS Nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas
live in fire cat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our
mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any
difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that
is boundless and the act a slave to limit
CRESSIDA They say all lovers swear more performance than they are
able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing
more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the
tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act
of hares are they not monsters
TROILUS Are there such Such are not we Praise us as we are
tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit
crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in
present We will not name desert before his birth and being
born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith
Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall
be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not
truer than Troilus
CRESSIDA Will you walk in my lord
PANDARUS What blushing still Have you not done talking yet
CRESSIDA Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you
give him me Be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it
faith
they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won
thrown
CRESSIDA Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart
For many weary months
TROILUS Why was my Cressid then so hard to win
CRESSIDA Hard to seem won but I was won my lord
If I confess much you will play the tyrant
I love you now but till now not so much
But I might master it In faith I lie
My thoughts were like unbridled children grown
Too headstrong for their mother See we fools
When we are so unsecret to ourselves
Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue
For in this rapture I shall surely speak
The thing I shall repent See see your silence
Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws
My very soul of counsel Stop my mouth
TROILUS And shall albeit sweet music issues thence
CRESSIDA My lord I do beseech you pardon me
For this time will I take my leave my lord
TROILUS Your leave sweet Cressid
CRESSIDA Pray you content you
TROILUS What offends you lady
CRESSIDA Sir mine own company
TROILUS You cannot shun yourself
CRESSIDA Let me go and try
I have a kind of self resides with you
But an unkind self that itself will leave
Where is my wit I know not what I speak
TROILUS Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely
CRESSIDA Perchance my lord I show more craft than love
And fell so roundly to a large confession
Or else you love not for to be wise and love
To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love
To keep her constancy in plight and youth
That doth renew swifter than blood decays
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me
That my integrity and truth to you
Might be affronted with the match and weight
Of such a winnowed purity in love
How were I then uplifted but alas
And simpler than the infancy of truth
TROILUS O virtuous fight
When right with right wars who shall be most right
True swains in love shall in the world to come
Approve their truth by Troilus when their rhymes
Full of protest of oath and big compare
As true as steel as plantage to the moon
As sun to day as turtle to her mate
Yet after all comparisons of truth
And sanctify the numbers
CRESSIDA Prophet may you be
If I be false or swerve a hair from truth
When time is old and hath forgot itself
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy
And mighty states characterless are grated
From false to false among false maids in love
As air as water wind or sandy earth
Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood
prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to
constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all
TROILUS Amen
CRESSIDA Amen
PANDARUS Amen Whereupon I will show you a chamber
and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters press it to death Away
Bed chamber pander to provide this gear                Exeunt
ACT III SCENE 3
The Greek camp
Flourish Enter AGAMEMNON ULYSSES DIOMEDES NESTOR AJAX MENELAUS
and CALCHAS
CALCHAS Now Princes for the service I have done
To call for recompense Appear it to your mind
That through the sight I bear in things to come
That time acquaintance custom and condition
Made tame and most familiar to my nature
And here to do you service am become
I do beseech you as in way of taste
To give me now a little benefit
Which you say live to come in my behalf
AGAMEMNON What wouldst thou of us Troyan Make demand
Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear
Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor
I know is such a wrest in their affairs
That their negotiations all must slack
Wanting his manage and they will almost
Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam
In change of him Let him be sent great Princes
And he shall buy my daughter and her presence
Shall quite strike off all service I have done
In most accepted pain
AGAMEMNON Let Diomedes bear him
And bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have
What he requests of us Good Diomed
Furnish you fairly for this interchange
Which I am proud to bear
Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS
ACHILLES and PATROCLUS stand in their tent
Please it our general pass strangely by him
As if he were forgot and Princes all
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him
To use between your strangeness and his pride
Which his own will shall have desire to drink
It may do good Pride hath no other glass
To show itself but pride for supple knees
A form of strangeness as we pass along
So do each lord and either greet him not
Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more
ACHILLES What comes the general to speak with me
AGAMEMNON What says Achilles Would he aught with us
NESTOR Would you my lord aught with the general
ACHILLES No
NESTOR Nothing my lord
AGAMEMNON The better
Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR
ACHILLES Good day good day
MENELAUS How do you How do you                              Exit
ACHILLES What does the cuckold scorn me
AJAX How now Patroclus
ACHILLES Good morrow Ajax
AJAX Ha
ACHILLES Good morrow
AJAX Ay and good next day too                               Exit
ACHILLES What mean these fellows Know they not Achilles
To send their smiles before them to Achilles
To holy altars
ACHILLES What am I poor of late
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer
And not a man for being simply man
Hath any honour but honour for those honours
That are without him as place riches and favour
Prizes of accident as oft as merit
Which when they fall as being slippery standers
Doth one pluck down another and together
Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy
At ample point all that I did possess
Something not worth in me such rich beholding
As they have often given Here is Ulysses
How now Ulysses
ACHILLES What are you reading
ULYSSES A strange fellow here
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath
Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection
As when his virtues shining upon others
Heat them and they retort that heat again
To the first giver
ACHILLES This is not strange Ulysses
The beauty that is borne here in the face
The bearer knows not but commends itself
Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed
For speculation turns not to itself
Where it may see itself This is not strange at all
Who in his circumstance expressly proves
That no man is the lord of anything
Though in and of him there be much consisting
Till he communicate his parts to others
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
The voice again or like a gate of steel
Fronting the sun receives and renders back
His figure and his heat I was much rapt in this
And apprehended here immediately
A very horse that has he knows not what
Nature what things there are
Most abject in regard and dear in use
What things again most dear in the esteem
While some men leave to do
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes
While pride is fasting in his wantonness
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder
And great Troy shrinking
Good word nor look What are my deeds forgot
ULYSSES Time hath my lord a wallet at his back
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion
As fast as they are made forgot as soon
As done Perseverance dear my lord
Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang
Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail
Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path
For emulation hath a thousand sons
That one by one pursue if you give way
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright
And leave you hindmost
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear
For Time is like a fashionable host
Grasps in the corner The welcome ever smiles
And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek
Remuneration for the thing it was
For beauty wit
High birth vigour of bone desert in service
Love friendship charity are subjects all
To envious and calumniating Time
Though they are made and moulded of things past
And give to dust that is a little gilt
The present eye praises the present object
Then marvel not thou great and complete man
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee
And still it might and yet it may again
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
And case thy reputation in thy tent
Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
And drave great Mars to faction
ACHILLES Of this my privacy
I have strong reasons
The reasons are more potent and heroical
ACHILLES Ha known
ULYSSES Is that a wonder
Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods
Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles
Which hath an operation more divine
Than breath or pen can give expressure to
All the commerce that you have had with Troy
As perfectly is ours as yours my lord
And better would it fit Achilles much
To throw down Hector than Polyxena
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home
When fame shall in our island sound her trump
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing
Farewell my lord I as your lover speak
A woman impudent and mannish grown
They think my little stomach to the war
And your great love to me restrains you thus
Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold
Be shook to airy air
ACHILLES Shall Ajax fight with Hector
PATROCLUS Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him
ACHILLES I see my reputation is at stake
PATROCLUS O then beware
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves
Omission to do what is necessary
Seals a commission to a blank of danger
And danger like an ague subtly taints
Even then when they sit idly in the sun
ACHILLES Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus
An appetite that I am sick withal
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace
To talk with him and to behold his visage
Even to my full of view
Enter THERSITES
THERSITES A wonder
ACHILLES What
THERSITES Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself
ACHILLES How so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in
saying nothing
ACHILLES How can that be
stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her
brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic
fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may
wear it on both sides like leather jerkin
ACHILLES Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites
arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands
to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax
ACHILLES To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant
tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the
Captain General of the Grecian army et cetera Agamemnon Do
this
PATROCLUS Jove bless great Ajax
THERSITES Hum
THERSITES Ha
PATROCLUS Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his
THERSITES Hum
PATROCLUS And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon
THERSITES Agamemnon
PATROCLUS Ay my lord
THERSITES Ha
THERSITES God buy you with all my heart
PATROCLUS Your answer sir
will go one way or other Howsoever he shall pay for me ere he
has me
PATROCLUS Your answer sir
THERSITES Fare ye well with all my heart
ACHILLES Why but he is not in this tune is he
none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings
ACHILLES Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight
capable creature
And I myself see not the bottom of it
Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS
THERSITES Would the fountain of your mind were clear again that I
might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than
such a valiant ignorance                                    Exit

ACT IV SCENE 1
Troy A street
Enter at one side AENEAS and servant with a torch at another
PARIS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR DIOMEDES the Grecian and others with torches
PARIS See ho Who is that there
DEIPHOBUS It is the Lord Aeneas
AENEAS Is the Prince there in person
Had I so good occasion to lie long
As you Prince Paris nothing but heavenly business
Witness the process of your speech wherein
You told how Diomed a whole week by days
Did haunt you in the field
AENEAS Health to you valiant sir
During all question of the gentle truce
As heart can think or courage execute
DIOMEDES The one and other Diomed embraces
Our bloods are now in calm and so long health
But when contention and occasion meet
With all my force pursuit and policy
AENEAS And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
With his face backward In humane gentleness
No man alive can love in such a sort
The thing he means to kill more excellently
DIOMEDES We sympathise Jove let Aeneas live
If to my sword his fate be not the glory
A thousand complete courses of the sun
But in mine emulous honour let him die
AENEAS We know each other well
DIOMEDESWe do and long to know each other worse
What business lord so early
AENEAS I was sent for to the King but why I know not
For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid
Rouse him and give him note of our approach
With the whole quality wherefore I fear
We shall be much unwelcome
AENEAS That I assure you
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
Than Cressid borne from Troy
PARIS There is no help
The bitter disposition of the time
AENEAS Good morrow all                         Exit with servant
Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best
Myself or Menelaus
DIOMEDES Both alike
He merits well to have her that doth seek her
Not making any scruple of her soilure
With such a hell of pain and world of charge
And you as well to keep her that defend her
Not palating the taste of her dishonour
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends
He like a puling cuckold would drink up
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece
You like a lecher out of whorish loins
But he as he the heavier for a whore
For every false drop in her bawdy veins
Of her contaminated carrion weight
A Troyan hath been slain since she could speak
She hath not given so many good words breath
PARIS Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do
Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy
But we in silence hold this virtue well
Here lies our way                                         Exeunt
ACT IV SCENE 2
Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA
TROILUS Dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold
He shall unbolt the gates
TROILUS Trouble him not
To bed to bed Sleep kill those pretty eyes
And give as soft attachment to thy senses
CRESSIDA Good morrow then
TROILUS I prithee now to bed
CRESSIDA Are you aweary of me
TROILUS O Cressida but that the busy day
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer
I would not from thee
CRESSIDA Night hath been too brief
TROILUS Beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays
As tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love
You will catch cold and curse me
CRESSIDA Prithee tarry
You men will never tarry
O foolish Cressid I might have still held off
TROILUS It is your uncle
Enter PANDARUS
CRESSIDA A pestilence on him Now will he be mocking
I shall have such a life
PANDARUS How now how now How go maidenheads
CRESSIDA Go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle
You bring me to do and then you flout me too
PANDARUS To do what to do what Let her say what
What have I brought you to do
Nor suffer others
PANDARUS Ha ha Alas poor wretch a poor capocchia hast not
bugbear take him
My lord come you again into my chamber
You smile and mock me as if I meant naughtily
TROILUS Ha ha
How earnestly they knock Pray you come in
I would not for half Troy have you seen here
Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA
Enter AENEAS
AENEAS Good morrow lord good morrow
I knew you not What news with you so early
AENEAS Is not Prince Troilus here
PANDARUS Here What should he do here
AENEAS Come he is here my lord do not deny him
It doth import him much to speak with me
sworn For my own part I came in late What should he do here
know of him but yet go fetch him hither go
AENEAS My lord I scarce have leisure to salute you
My matter is so rash There is at hand
Paris your brother and Deiphobus
The Grecian Diomed and our Antenor
Ere the first sacrifice within this hour
The Lady Cressida
TROILUS Is it so concluded
AENEAS By Priam and the general state of Troy
They are at hand and ready to effect it
TROILUS How my achievements mock me
I will go meet them and my lord Aeneas
We met by chance you did not find me here
AENEAS Good good my lord the secrets of neighbour Pandar
Have not more gift in taciturnity
Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS
Antenor The young prince will go mad A plague upon Antenor I
PANDARUS Ah ah
PANDARUS Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above
I knew thou wouldst be his death O poor gentleman A plague
upon Antenor
CRESSIDA Good uncle I beseech you on my knees I beseech you
PANDARUS Thou must be gone wench thou must be gone thou art
CRESSIDA O you immortal gods I will not go
PANDARUS Thou must
CRESSIDA I will not uncle I have forgot my father
I know no touch of consanguinity
No kin no love no blood no soul so near me
As the sweet Troilus O you gods divine
If ever she leave Troilus Time force and death
Do to this body what extremes you can
But the strong base and building of my love
Is as the very centre of the earth
PANDARUS Do do
CRESSIDA Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
Exeunt
ACT IV SCENE 3
Enter PARIS TROILUS AENEAS DEIPHOBUS ANTENOR and DIOMEDES
For her delivery to this valiant Greek
Comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus
Tell you the lady what she is to do
And haste her to the purpose
TROILUS Walk into her house
And to his hand when I deliver her
Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus
And would as I shall pity I could help
Please you walk in my lords                              Exeunt
ACT IV SCENE 4
Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA
PANDARUS Be moderate be moderate
CRESSIDA Why tell you me of moderation
The grief is fine full perfect that I taste
And violenteth in a sense as strong
As that which causeth it How can I moderate it
If I could temporize with my affections
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate
The like allayment could I give my grief
My love admits no qualifying dross
No more my grief in such a precious loss
Enter TROILUS
PANDARUS Here here here he comes Ah sweet ducks
O heart heavy heart
where he answers again
Because thou canst not ease thy smart
By friendship nor by speaking
There was never a truer rhyme Let us cast away nothing for we
may live to have need of such a verse We see it we see it How
now lambs
More bright in zeal than the devotion which
Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me
CRESSIDA Have the gods envy
CRESSIDA And is it true that I must go from Troy
TROILUS A hateful truth
CRESSIDA What and from Troilus too
TROILUS From Troy and Troilus
TROILUS And suddenly where injury of chance
All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips
Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath
We two that with so many thousand sighs
Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves
With the rude brevity and discharge of one
Crams his rich thievery up he knows not how
As many farewells as be stars in heaven
He fumbles up into a loose adieu
Distasted with the salt of broken tears
Bid them have patience she shall come anon
PANDARUS Where are my tears Rain to lay this wind or my heart
CRESSIDA I must then to the Grecians
TROILUS No remedy
When shall we see again
CRESSIDA I true how now What wicked deem is this
TROILUS Nay we must use expostulation kindly
For it is parting from us
For I will throw my glove to Death himself
My sequent protestation be thou true
And I will see thee
CRESSIDA And you this glove When shall I see you
TROILUS I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels
To give thee nightly visitation
But yet be true
TROILUS Hear why I speak it love
The Grecian youths are full of quality
How novelties may move and parts with person
Alas a kind of godly jealousy
Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin
Makes me afeard
CRESSIDA O heavens you love me not
TROILUS Die I a villain then
In this I do not call your faith in question
So mainly as my merit I cannot sing
Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant
But I can tell that in each grace of these
That tempts most cunningly But be not tempted
CRESSIDA Do you think I will
TROILUS No
But something may be done that we will not
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers
Presuming on their changeful potency
TROILUS Come kiss and let us part
TROILUS Good brother come you hither
And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you
CRESSIDA My lord will you be true
TROILUS Who I Alas it is my vice my fault
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion
I with great truth catch mere simplicity
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare
Enter AENEAS PARIS ANTENOR DEIPHOBUS and DIOMEDES
Fear not my truth the moral of my wit
Welcome Sir Diomed Here is the lady
Which for Antenor we deliver you
And by the way possess thee what she is
Entreat her fair and by my soul fair Greek
Name Cressid and thy life shall be as safe
As Priam is in Ilion
DIOMEDES Fair Lady Cressid
So please you save the thanks this prince expects
The lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek
Pleads your fair usage and to Diomed
You shall be mistress and command him wholly
TROILUS Grecian thou dost not use me courteously
To shame the zeal of my petition to the
In praising her I tell thee lord of Greece
I charge thee use her well even for my charge
For by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard
To be a speaker free when I am hence
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head
Lady give me your hand and as we walk
To our own selves bend we our needful talk
Exeunt TROILUS CRESSIDA and DIOMEDES
AENEAS How have we spent this morning
The Prince must think me tardy and remiss
That swore to ride before him to the field
DEIPHOBUS Let us make ready straight
The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
On his fair worth and single chivalry                     Exeunt
ACT IV SCENE 5
The Grecian camp Lists set out
Enter AJAX armed AGAMEMNON ACHILLES PATROCLUS MENELAUS ULYSSES
NESTOR and others
AGAMEMNON Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair
Anticipating time with starting courage
Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy
Thou dreadful Ajax that the appalled air
May pierce the head of the great combatant
And hale him hither
Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe
Blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek
Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood
ULYSSES No trumpet answers
Enter DIOMEDES with CRESSIDA
He rises on the toe That spirit of his
In aspiration lifts him from the earth
AGAMEMNON Is this the lady Cressid
DIOMEDES Even she
AGAMEMNON Most dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet lady
NESTOR Our general doth salute you with a kiss
ULYSSES Yet is the kindness but particular
So much for Nestor
Achilles bids you welcome
MENELAUS I had good argument for kissing once
And parted thus you and your argument
ULYSSES O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns
For which we lose our heads to gild his horns
Patroclus kisses you
MENELAUS O this is trim
PATROCLUS Paris and I kiss evermore for him
CRESSIDA In kissing do you render or receive
PATROCLUS Both take and give
The kiss you take is better than you give
Therefore no kiss
CRESSIDA You are an odd man give even or give none
MENELAUS An odd man lady Every man is odd
That you are odd and he is even with you
ULYSSES It were no match your nail against his horn
May I sweet lady beg a kiss of you
CRESSIDA You may
ULYSSES I do desire it
CRESSIDA Why beg then
When Helen is a maid again and his
Exit with CRESSIDA
NESTOR A woman of quick sense
ULYSSES Fie fie upon her
Nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out
At every joint and motive of her body
O these encounters so glib of tongue
That give a coasting welcome ere it comes
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
To every ticklish reader Set them down
For sluttish spoils of opportunity
Enter HECTOR armed AENEAS TROILUS PARIS HELENUS
and other Trojans with attendants
AGAMEMNON Yonder comes the troop
AENEAS Hail all the state of Greece What shall be done
To him that victory commands Or do you purpose
A victor shall be known Will you the knights
Shall to the edge of all extremity
Pursue each other or shall they be divided
By any voice or order of the field
Hector bade ask
AGAMEMNON Which way would Hector have it
A little proudly and great deal misprizing
AENEAS If not Achilles sir
What is your name
ACHILLES If not Achilles nothing
In the extremity of great and little
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector
The one almost as infinite as all
The other blank as nothing Weigh him well
And that which looks like pride is courtesy
In love whereof half Hector stays at home
Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek
This blended knight half Troyan and half Greek
ACHILLES A maiden battle then O I perceive you
AGAMEMNON Here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight
Consent upon the order of their fight
So be it either to the uttermost
Or else a breath The combatants being kin
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin
AGAMEMNON What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy
ULYSSES The youngest son of Priam a true knight
Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue
His heart and hand both open and both free
For what he has he gives what thinks he shows
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty
Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath
Manly as Hector but more dangerous
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
To tender objects but he in heat of action
Is more vindicative than jealous love
They call him Troilus and on him erect
A second hope as fairly built as Hector
Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth
Even to his inches and with private soul
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me
AGAMEMNON They are in action
NESTOR Now Ajax hold thine own
Awake thee
DIOMEDES You must no more
AENEAS Princes enough so please you
AJAX I am not warm yet let us fight again
DIOMEDES As Hector pleases
HECTOR Why then will I no more
The obligation of our blood forbids
Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so
And this is Troyan the sinews of this leg
Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
Wherein my sword had not impressure made
Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay
My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword
Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax
By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms
Hector would have them fall upon him thus
Cousin all honour to thee
AJAX I thank thee Hector
Thou art too gentle and too free a man
I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence
A great addition earned in thy death
HECTOR Not Neoptolemus so mirable
A thought of added honour torn from Hector
AENEAS There is expectance here from both the sides
What further you will do
The issue is embracement Ajax farewell
AJAX If I might in entreaties find success
As seld I have the chance I would desire
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents
HECTOR Aeneas call my brother Troilus to me
And signify this loving interview
To the expecters of our Troyan part
Desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin
I will go eat with thee and see your knights
AGAMEMNON and the rest of the Greeks come forward
AJAX Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here
HECTOR The worthiest of them tell me name by name
But for Achilles my own searching eyes
Shall find him by his large and portly size
AGAMEMNONWorthy all arms as welcome as to one
That would be rid of such an enemy
And formless ruin of oblivion
But in this extant moment faith and troth
Bids thee with most divine integrity
From heart of very heart great Hector welcome
HECTOR I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon
You brace of warlike brothers welcome hither
HECTOR Who must we answer
AENEAS The noble Menelaus
HECTOR O you my lord By Mars his gauntlet thanks
Mock not that I affect the untraded oath
HECTOR O pardon I offend
NESTOR I have thou gallant Troyan seen thee oft
Labouring for destiny make cruel way
Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee
As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed
Despising many forfeits and subduements
Not letting it decline on the declined
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath
Like an Olympian wrestling This have I seen
I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire
And once fought with him He was a soldier good
But by great Mars the captain of us all
Never like thee O let an old man embrace thee
And worthy warrior welcome to our tents
HECTOR Let me embrace thee good old chronicle
Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee
NESTOR I would my arms could match thee in contention
As they contend with thee in courtesy
HECTOR I would they could
NESTOR Ha
Well welcome welcome I have seen the time
ULYSSES I wonder now how yonder city stands
When we have here her base and pillar by us
HECTOR I know your favour Lord Ulysses well
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
In Ilion on your Greekish embassy
ULYSSES Sir I foretold you then what would ensue
My prophecy is but half his journey yet
For yonder walls that pertly front your town
Yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds
Must kiss their own feet
HECTOR I must not believe you
There they stand yet and modestly I think
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
A drop of Grecian blood The end crowns all
And that old common arbitrator Time
Will one day end it
ULYSSES So to him we leave it
Most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome
After the General I beseech you next
To feast with me and see me at my tent
ACHILLES I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou
Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee
And quoted joint by joint
HECTOR Is this Achilles
ACHILLES I am Achilles
HECTOR Stand fair I pray thee let me look on thee
ACHILLES Behold thy fill
HECTOR Nay I have done already
ACHILLES Thou art too brief I will the second time
As I would buy thee view thee limb by limb
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye
ACHILLES Tell me you heavens in which part of his body
Shall I destroy him Whether there or there or there
That I may give the local wound a name
And make distinct the very breach whereout
HECTOR It would discredit the blest gods proud man
To answer such a question Stand again
As to prenominate in nice conjecture
Where thou wilt hit me dead
ACHILLES I tell thee yea
HECTOR Wert thou an oracle to tell me so
But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm
You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag
His insolence draws folly from my lips
AJAX Do not chafe thee cousin
And you Achilles let these threats alone
You may have every day enough of Hector
If you have stomach The general state I fear
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him
HECTOR I pray you let us see you in the field
ACHILLES Dost thou entreat me Hector
HECTOR Thy hand upon that match
AGAMEMNON First all you peers of Greece go to my tent
There in the full convive we afterwards
Concur together severally entreat him
Beat loud the tambourines let the trumpets blow
That this great soldier may his welcome know
Exeunt all but TROILUS and ULYSSES
TROILUS My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
On the fair Cressid
TROILUS Shall I sweet lord be bound to you so much
To bring me thither
ULYSSES You shall command me sir
As gentle tell me of what honour was
This Cressida in Troy Had she no lover there
That wails her absence
TROILUS O sir to such as boasting show their scars
A mock is due Will you walk on my lord

PATROCLUS Out gall
THERSITES Finch egg
ACHILLES My sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba
A token from her daughter my fair love
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
An oath that I have sworn I will not break it
Fall Greeks fail fame honour or go or stay
Come come Thersites help to trim my tent
This night in banqueting must all be spent
Away Patroclus                              Exit with PATROCLUS
THERSITES With too much blood and too little brain these two may
run mad but if with too much brain and to little blood they do
enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain
brother the bull the primitive statue and oblique memorial of
malice and malice forced with wit turn him to To an ass were
nothing he is both ass and ox To an ox were nothing he is both
ox and ass To be a dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a

Ask me not what I would be if I were not Thersites for I care

ACHILLES Come come enter my tent
Exeunt all but THERSITES
knave I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a
serpent when he hisses He will spend his mouth and promise like
Brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell
it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun
borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word I will rather
leave to see Hector than not to dog him They say he keeps a
Nothing but lechery All incontinent varlets                Exit

ULYSSES Stand where the torch may not discover us
Enter CRESSIDA
TROILUS Cressid comes forth to him
DIOMEDES How now my charge

CRESSIDA Remember Yes
DIOMEDES Nay but do then
And let your mind be coupled with your words
TROILUS What shall she remember
ULYSSES List
CRESSIDA Sweet honey Greek tempt me no more to folly
THERSITES Roguery
CRESSIDA In faith I cannot What would you have me do
THERSITES A juggling trick to be secretly open
DIOMEDES What did you swear you would bestow on me
CRESSIDA I prithee do not hold me to mine oath
Bid me do anything but that sweet Greek
DIOMEDES Good night
TROILUS Hold patience
ULYSSES How now Troyan
CRESSIDA Diomed
TROILUS Thy better must
CRESSIDA Hark a word in your ear
TROILUS O plague and madness
ULYSSES You are moved Prince let us depart I pray
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
To wrathful terms This place is dangerous
The time right deadly I beseech you go
TROILUS Behold I pray you
ULYSSES Nay good my lord go off
You flow to great distraction come my lord
TROILUS I prithee stay
ULYSSES You have not patience come
I will not speak a word
DIOMEDES And so good night
CRESSIDA Nay but you part in anger
TROILUS Doth that grieve thee O withered truth
ULYSSES How now my lord
TROILUS By Jove I will be patient
CRESSIDA Guardian Why Greek
DIOMEDES Fo fo adieu you palter
CRESSIDA In faith I do not Come hither once again
ULYSSES You shake my lord at something will you go
You will break out
TROILUS She strokes his cheek
ULYSSES Come come
TROILUS Nay stay by Jove I will not speak a word
There is between my will and all offences
A guard of patience Stay a little while
THERSITES How the devil luxury with his fat rump and potato
finger tickles these together Fry lechery fry
DIOMEDES But will you then
CRESSIDA In faith I will lo never trust me else
DIOMEDES Give me some token for the surety of it
ULYSSES You have sworn patience
TROILUS Fear me not my lord
I will not be myself nor have cognition
Of what I feel I am all patience
THERSITES Now the pledge now now now
CRESSIDA Here Diomed keep this sleeve
TROILUS O beauty where is thy faith
ULYSSES My lord
TROILUS I will be patient outwardly I will
CRESSIDA You look upon that sleeve behold it well
I prithee Diomed visit me no more
THERSITES Now she sharpens Well said whetstone
DIOMEDES I shall have it
CRESSIDA What this
DIOMEDES Ay that
CRESSIDA O all you gods O pretty pretty pledge
Thy master now lies thinking on his bed
Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it
As I kiss thee Nay do not snatch it from me
He that takes that doth take my heart withal
DIOMEDES I had your heart before this follows it
TROILUS I did swear patience
CRESSIDA You shall not have it Diomed faith you shall not
DIOMEDES I will have this Whose was it
CRESSIDA It is no matter
DIOMEDES Come tell me whose it was
But now you have it take it
DIOMEDES Whose was it
And by herself I will not tell you whose
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it
I will not keep my word
DIOMEDES Why then farewell
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again
CRESSIDA You shall not go One cannot speak a word
But it straight starts you
DIOMEDES I do not like this fooling
THERSITES Nor I by Pluto but that that likes not you
Pleases me best
DIOMEDES Farewell till then
CRESSIDA Good night I prithee come                 Exit DIOMEDES
Troilus farewell One eye yet looks on thee
But with my heart the other eye doth see
Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find
The error of our eye directs our mind
What error leads must err O then conclude
THERSITES A proof of strength she could not publish more
TROILUS It is
ULYSSES Why stay we then
TROILUS To make a recordation to my soul
Of every syllable that here was spoke
But if I tell how these two did coact
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart
An esperance so obstinately strong
As if those organs had deceptious functions
Created only to calumniate
Was Cressid here
ULYSSES I cannot conjure Troyan
TROILUS She was not sure
ULYSSES Most sure she was
TROILUS Why my negation hath no taste of madness
ULYSSES Nor mine my lord Cressid was here but now
Think we had mothers do not give advantage
To stubborn critics apt without a theme
For depravation to square the general sex
ULYSSES What hath she done Prince that can soil our mothers
TROILUS Nothing at all unless that this were she
If beauty have a soul this is not she
If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies
If there be rule in unity itself
This was not she O madness of discourse
That cause sets up with and against itself
Bifold authority where reason can revolt
Without perdition and loss assume all reason
Without revolt this is and is not Cressid
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
Divides more wider than the sky and earth
And yet the spacious breadth of this division
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven
Instance O instance strong as heaven itself
The fractions of her faith orts of her love
The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics
With that which here his passion doth express
TROILUS Ay Greek and that shall be divulged well
In characters as red as Mars his heart
Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love
So much by weight hate I her Diomed
My sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout
Which shipmen do the hurricano call
In his descent than shall my prompted sword
Falling on Diomed
TROILUS O Cressid O false Cressid false false false
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name
ULYSSES O contain yourself
Your passion draws ears hither
Enter AENEAS
AENEAS I have been seeking you this hour my lord
Hector by this is arming him in Troy
Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home
TROILUS Have with you Prince My courteous lord adieu
Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head
TROILUS Accept distracted thanks
Exeunt TROILUS AENEAS and ULYSSES
THERSITES Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like
a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus will give me
anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery
lechery Still wars and lechery Nothing else holds fashion A
burning devil take them                                     Exit
ACT V SCENE 3
Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE
To stop his ears against admonishment
HECTOR You train me to offend you get you in
ANDROMACHE My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day
HECTOR No more I say
Enter CASSANDRA
CASSANDRA Where is my brother Hector
Consort with me in loud and dear petition
Pursue we him on knees for I have dreamt
Of bloody turbulence and this whole night
Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter
HECTOR Ho bid my trumpet sound
CASSANDRA No notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother
HECTOR Be gone I say The gods have heard me swear
CASSANDRA The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice
ANDROMACHE O be persuaded Do not count it holy
To hurt by being just It is as lawful
For we would give much to use violent thefts
And rob in the behalf of charity
CASSANDRA It is the purpose that makes strong the vow
But vows to every purpose must not hold
Unarm sweet Hector
HECTOR Hold you still I say
Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate
Life every man holds dear but the dear man
Holds honour far more precious dear than life
Enter TROILUS
ANDROMACHE Cassandra call my father to persuade
Exit CASSANDRA
HECTOR No faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth
Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong
And tempt not yet the brushes of the war
Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy
TROILUS Brother you have a vice of mercy in you
Which better fits a lion than a man
HECTOR What vice is that good Troilus
Chide me for it
TROILUS When many times the captive Grecian falls
Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword
You bid them rise and live
HECTOR How now how now
And when we have our armours buckled on
Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth
HECTOR Fie savage fie
TROILUS Who should withhold me
Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars
Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees
Nor you my brother with your true sword drawn
But by my ruin
CASSANDRA Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast
He is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay
Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee
Fall all together
PRIAM Come Hector come go back
Thy wife hath dreamt thy mother hath had visions
Cassandra doth foresee and I myself
Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
To tell thee that this day is ominous
Therefore come back
Even in the faith of valour to appear
This morning to them
PRIAM Ay but thou shalt not go
HECTOR I must not break my faith
You know me dutiful therefore dear sir
Let me not shame respect but give me leave
To take that course by your consent and voice
Which you do here forbid me royal Priam
CASSANDRA O Priam yield not to him
ANDROMACHE Do not dear father
HECTOR Andromache I am offended with you
Upon the love you bear me get you in
Exit ANDROMACHE
TROILUS This foolish dreaming superstitious girl
Makes all these bodements
CASSANDRA O farewell dear Hector
Look how thou diest Look how thy eye turns pale
Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents
Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out
How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth
Behold distraction frenzy and amazement
Like witless antics one another meet
TROILUS Away away
Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive                  Exit
Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night
PRIAM Farewell The gods with safety stand about thee
Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR Alarums
TROILUS They are at it hark Proud Diomed believe
I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve
Enter PANDARUS
PANDARUS Do you hear my lord Do you hear
TROILUS What now
TROILUS Let me read
PANDARUS A whoreson tisick a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles
me and the foolish fortune of this girl and what one thing
a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that
says she there
TROILUS Words words mere words no matter from the heart
Go wind to wind there turn and change together
My love with words and errors still she feeds
But edifies another with her deeds              Exeunt severally
ACT V SCENE 4
The plain between Troy and the Grecian camp
Enter THERSITES Excursions
on That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same
helm I would fain see them meet that that same young Troyan ass
that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly
villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of
blackberry They set me up in policy that mongrel cur Ajax
against that dog of as bad a kind Achilles and now is the cur
whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy
grows into an ill opinion
Enter DIOMEDES TROILUS following
TROILUS Fly not for shouldst thou take the river Styx
I would swim after
DIOMEDES Thou dost miscall retire
I do not fly but advantageous care
Withdrew me from the odds of multitude
Have at thee
THERSITES Hold thy whore Grecian now for thy whore
Exeunt TROILUS and DIOMEDES fighting
Enter HECTOR
Art thou of blood and honour
filthy rogue
HECTOR I do believe thee Live                               Exit
rogues I think they have swallowed one another I would laugh at
them                                                        Exit
ACT V SCENE 5

Fellow commend my service to her beauty
And am her knight by proof

Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives
Cold statues of the youth and in a word
Scare Troy out of itself But march away
Hector is dead there is no more to say

you set a work and how ill requited Why should our endeavour be
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail
Good traders in the flesh set this in your painted
Or if you cannot weep yet give some groans
Though not for me yet for your aching bones
Some two months hence my will shall here be made
It should be now but that my fear is this
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss
And at that time bequeath you my diseases                   Exit

SCENE
ACT I SCENE I
Enter ORSINO Duke of Illyria CURIO and other LORDS MUSICIANS attending
DUKE If music be the food of love play on
Give me excess of it that surfeiting
The appetite may sicken and so die
That strain again It had a dying fall
That breathes upon a bank of violets
Stealing and giving odour Enough no more
O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou
That notwithstanding thy capacity
Receiveth as the sea nought enters there
But falls into abatement and low price
Even in a minute So full of shapes is fancy
That it alone is high fantastical
CURIO Will you go hunt my lord
DUKE What Curio
CURIO The hart
DUKE Why so I do the noblest that I have
O when mine eyes did see Olivia first
And my desires like fell and cruel hounds
Enter VALENTINE
How now what news from her
VALENTINE So please my lord I might not be admitted
But from her handmaid do return this answer
Shall not behold her face at ample view
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk
And water once a day her chamber round
And lasting in her sad remembrance
DUKE O she that hath a heart of that fine frame
To pay this debt of love but to a brother
How will she love when the rich golden shaft
That live in her when liver brain and heart
Her sweet perfections with one self king
Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter VIOLA a CAPTAIN and SAILORS
VIOLA What country friends is this
CAPTAIN This is Illyria lady
VIOLA And what should I do in Illyria
My brother he is in Elysium
CAPTAIN It is perchance that you yourself were saved
VIOLA O my poor brother and so perchance may he be
CAPTAIN True madam and to comfort you with chance
Assure yourself after our ship did split
When you and those poor number saved with you
Hung on our driving boat I saw your brother
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope
Whereto thy speech serves for authority
CAPTAIN Ay madam well for I was bred and born
VIOLA Who governs here
CAPTAIN A noble duke in nature as in name
VIOLA What is his name
CAPTAIN Orsino
VIOLA Orsino I have heard my father name him
He was a bachelor then
CAPTAIN And so is now or was so very late
For but a month ago I went from hence
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia
CAPTAIN A virtuous maid the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since then leaving her
In the protection of his son her brother
Who shortly also died for whose dear love
And sight of men
And might not be delivered to the world
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow
What my estate is
CAPTAIN That were hard to compass
VIOLA There is a fair behaviour in thee Captain
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
With this thy fair and outward character
Conceal me what I am and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall become
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him
It may be worth thy pains for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music
That will allow me very worth his service
What else may hap to time I will commit
Only shape thou silence to my wit
When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see
VIOLA I thank thee Lead me on                        Exeunt

SIR TOBY Wherefore are these things hid Wherefore have these
galliard and come home in a coranto My very walk should be a

To call his fortunes thine

beauties let me sustain no scorn I am very comptible even to
the least sinister usage
OLIVIA Whence came you sir
VIOLA I can say little more than I have studied and that
assurance if you be the lady of the house that I may proceed in
my speech
OLIVIA Are you a comedian
VIOLA No my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice
I swear I am not that I play Are you the lady of the house
OLIVIA If I do not usurp myself I am
VIOLA Most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for
what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve But this is from
my commission I will on with my speech in your praise and then
show you the heart of my message
OLIVIA It is the more like to be feigned I pray you keep it in I
rather to wonder at you than to hear you If you be not mad be
with me to make one in so skipping dialogue
MARIA Will you hoist sail sir Here lies your way
VIOLA No good swabber I am to hull here a little longer
Some mollification for your giant sweet lady
OLIVIA Tell me your mind
VIOLA I am a messenger
OLIVIA Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the
courtesy of it is so fearful Speak your office
VIOLA It alone concerns your ear I bring no overture of war no
taxation of homage I hold the olive in my hand my words are as
full of peace as matter
OLIVIA Yet you began rudely What are you What would you
entertainment What I am and what I would are as secret as
OLIVIA Give us the place alone we will hear this divinity
OLIVIA A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it
Where lies your text
OLIVIA In his bosom In what chapter of his bosom
VIOLA To answer by the method in the first of his heart
OLIVIA O I have read it it is heresy Have you no more to say
VIOLA Good madam let me see your face
OLIVIA Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my
face You are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain
VIOLA Excellently done if God did all
If you will lead these graces to the grave
And leave the world no copy
divers schedules of my beauty It shall be inventoried and every
indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one
neck one chin and so forth Were you sent hither to praise me
VIOLA I see you what you are you are too proud
But if you were the devil you are fair
The nonpareil of beauty
OLIVIA How does he love me
VIOLA With adorations fertile tears
With groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
OLIVIA Your lord does know my mind I cannot love him
Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble
Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth
And in dimension and the shape of nature
A gracious person but yet I cannot love him
He might have took his answer long ago
In your denial I would find no sense
I would not understand it
OLIVIA Why what would you
VIOLA Make me a willow cabin at your gate
And call upon my soul within the house
Write loyal cantons of contemned love
And sing them loud even in the dead of night
Halloo your name to the reverberate hals
And make the babbling gossip of the air
Between the elements of air and earth
But you should pity me
OLIVIA You might do much
What is your parentage
VIOLA Above my fortunes yet my state is well
I am a gentleman
OLIVIA Get you to your lord
Unless perchance you come to me again
To tell me how he takes it Fare you well
I thank you for your pains spend this for me
My master not myself lacks recompense
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love
Thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit
Unless the master were the man How now
Even so quickly may one catch the plague
With an invisible and subtle stealth
To creep in at mine eyes Well let it be
What ho Malvolio
MALVOLIO Here madam at your service
OLIVIA Run after that same peevish messenger
Desire him not to flatter with his lord
Nor hold him up with hopes I am not for him
MALVOLIO Madam I will                                  Exit
OLIVIA I do I know not what and fear to find
Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind
Fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe
What is decreed must be and be this so                Exit

Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN
ANTONIO Will you stay no longer nor will you not that I go with
you
SEBASTIAN By your patience no My stars shine darkly over me the
malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore I
shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone It
were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
ANTONIO Let me know of you whither you are bound
SEBASTIAN No sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of
modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to
keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
myself You must know of me then Antonio my name is Sebastian
Messaline whom I know you have heard of He left behind him
myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had
for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was
ANTONIO Alas the day
SEBASTIAN A lady sir though it was said she much resembled me
was yet of many accounted beautiful but though I could not with
such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far I will
boldly publish her she bore mind that envy could not but call
to drown her remembrance again with more
ANTONIO Pardon me sir your bad entertainment
SEBASTIAN O good Antonio forgive me your trouble
ANTONIO If you will not murder me for my love let me be your
servant
my bosom is full of kindness and I am yet so near the manners of
my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
Exit
ANTONIO The gentleness of all the gods go with thee
Else would I very shortly see thee there
But come what may I do adore thee so
That danger shall seem sport and I will go            Exit

MALVOLIO She returns this ring to you sir you might have saved
me my pains to have taken it away yourself She adds moreover
that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will

taking of this Receive it so
MALVOLIO Come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is
lies in your eye if not be it his that finds it
Exit
VIOLA I left no ring with her what means this lady
She made good view of me indeed so much
That methought her eyes had lost her tongue
For she did speak in starts distractedly
She loves me sure the cunning of her passion
Invites me in this churlish messenger
Poor lady she were better love a dream
Disguise I see thou art a wickedness
Wherein the pregnant enemy does much
Alas our frailty is the cause not we
For such as we are made of such we be
How will this fadge My master loves her dearly
And I poor monster fond as much on him
And she mistaken seems to dote on me
What will become of this As I am man
What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe
O Time thou must untangle this not I

eating and drinking
Marian I say a stoup of wine
Enter CLOWN
AGUECHEEK By my troth the fool has an excellent breast I had

done Now a song

Journeys end in lovers meeting

CLOWN sings
Present mirth hath present laughter
In delay there lies no plenty
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty
AGUECHEEK A mellifluous voice as I am true knight
SIR TOBY A contagious breath
SIR TOBY To hear by the nose it is dulcet in contagion But shall
a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver Shall we do
that
CLOWN I shall never begin if I hold my peace
Enter MARIA

Lady lady

Enter MALVOLIO
MALVOLIO My masters are you mad Or what are you Have you no

farewell
MARIA Nay good Sir Toby
MALVOLIO This is much credit to you

A stoup of wine Maria
more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil
rule she shall know of it by this hand
Exit
MARIA Go shake your ears
to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him
and make a fool of him
deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth
For Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him if I do not gull
him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not
think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed I know I can
do it
SIR TOBY Possess us possess us tell us something of him
MARIA Marry sir sometimes he is a kind of Puritan
SIR TOBY What for being a Puritan Thy exquisite reason dear
knight
enough
MARIA The devil a Puritan that he is or anything constantly but a
utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself so
of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in
him will my revenge find notable cause to work
SIR TOBY What wilt thou do
MARIA I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love
wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the
manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and
complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated I
can write very like my lady your niece on forgotten matter we
can hardly make distinction of our hands
SIR TOBY Excellent I smell a device
SIR TOBY He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that
MARIA My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour
AGUECHEEK And your horse now would make him an ass
MARIA Ass I doubt not
MARIA Sport royal I warrant you I know my physic will work with
him I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where
he shall find the letter observe his construction of it For
this night to bed and dream on the event Farewell
Exit
SIR TOBY Good night Penthesilea

AGUECHEEK If I cannot recover your niece I am a foul way out
call me Cut
AGUECHEEK If I do not never trust me take it how you will
to bed now Come knight come knight
Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter DUKE VIOLA CURIO and OTHERS
DUKE Give me some music Now good morrow friends
Now good Cesario but that piece of song
That old and antique song we heard last night
Methought it did relieve my passion much
More than light airs and recollected terms
Come but one verse
CURIO He is not here so please your lordship that should sing
DUKE Who was it
father took much delight in He is about the house
DUKE Seek him out and play the tune the while
Come hither boy If ever thou shalt love
In the sweet pangs of it remember me
For such as I am all true lovers are
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else
Save in the constant image of the creature
VIOLA It gives a very echo to the seat
DUKE Thou dost speak masterly
Hath it not boy
VIOLA A little by your favour
VIOLA Of your complexion
VIOLA About your years my lord
DUKE Too old by heaven Let still the woman take
An elder than herself so wears she to him
For boy however we do praise ourselves
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm
More longing wavering sooner lost and won
VIOLA I think it well my lord
DUKE Then let thy love be younger than thyself
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent
VIOLA And so they are alas that they are so
To die even when they to perfection grow
DUKE O fellow come the song we had last night
Mark it Cesario it is old and plain
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
Do use to chant it it is silly sooth
And dallies with the innocence of love
Like the old age
CLOWN Are you ready sir
Come away come away death
And in sad cypress let me be laid
Fly away fly away breath
I am slain by a fair cruel maid
My shroud of white stuck all with yew
O prepare it
My part of death no one so true
Did share it
Not a flower not a flower sweet
On my black coffin let there be strown
Not a friend not a friend greet
My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown
A thousand thousand to save
Lay me O where
Sad true lover never find my grave
To weep there
CLOWN No pains sir I take pleasure in singing sir
CLOWN Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another
DUKE Give me now leave to leave thee
CLOWN Now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy
doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal I
would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business
that always makes a good voyage of nothing Farewell
Exit CLOWN
DUKE Let all the rest give place
Exeunt CURIO and ATTENDANTS
Once more Cesario
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty
Tell her my love more noble than the world
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands
Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune
That Nature pranks her in attracts my soul
VIOLA But if she cannot love you sir
VIOLA Sooth but you must
Say that some lady as perhaps there is
Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
As you have for Olivia You cannot love her
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
So big to hold so much they lack retention
That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt
But mine is all as hungry as the sea
And can digest as much Make no compare
Between that love a woman can bear me
And that I owe Olivia
DUKE What dost thou know
VIOLA Too well what love women to men may owe
In faith they are as true of heart as we
As it might be perhaps were I a woman
I should your lordship
VIOLA A blank my lord She never told her love
And with a green and yellow melancholy
She sat like Patience on a monument
Smiling at grief Was not this love indeed
We men may say more swear more but indeed
Our shows are more than will for still we prove
Much in our vows but little in our love
DUKE But died thy sister of her love my boy
Sir shall I to this lady
To her in haste Give her this jewel say
My love can give no place bide no denay             Exeunt
SCENE V
Enter SIR TOBY SIR ANDREW and FABIAN
SIR TOBY Come thy ways Signior Fabian
SIR TOBY Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally
AGUECHEEK And we do not it is pity of our lives
Enter MARIA
SIR TOBY Here comes the little villain
How now my metal of India

mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot
caught with tickling
Exit
Enter MALVOLIO
did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that
should she fancy it should be one of my complexion Besides she
uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that
SIR TOBY Peace I say
MALVOLIO To be Count Malvolio
SIR TOBY Ah rogue
AGUECHEEK Pistol him pistol him
SIR TOBY Peace peace
the yeoman of the wardrobe
AGUECHEEK Fie on him Jezebel
him
MALVOLIO Having been three months married to her sitting in my
SIR TOBY Fire and brimstone
FABIAN O peace peace
MALVOLIO And then to have the humour of state and after a demure
travel of regard telling them I know my place as I would they
SIR TOBY Bolts and shackles
FABIAN O peace peace peace Now now
MALVOLIO Seven of my people with an obedient start make out for
him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play
SIR TOBY Shall this fellow live
FABIAN Though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace
MALVOLIO I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile
SIR TOBY What what
SIR TOBY Out scab
FABIAN Nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot
MALVOLIO What employment have we here
FABIAN Now is the woodcock near the gin
SIR TOBY O peace And the spirit of humours intimate reading
aloud to him
is in contempt of question her hand
To whom should this be
FABIAN This wins him liver and all
Jove knows I love
But who
Lips do not move
SIR TOBY Marry hang thee brock
But silence like a Lucrece knife
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore
FABIAN A fustian riddle
SIR TOBY Excellent wench say I
Nay but first let me see let me see let me see
SIR TOBY And with what wing the staniel checks at it
serve her she is my lady Why this is evident to any formal
should that alphabetical position portend If I could make that
SIR TOBY O ay make up that He is now at a cold scent
as a fox
FABIAN Did not I say he would work it out
The cur is excellent at faults
suffers under probation A should follow but O does
FABIAN And O shall end I hope
MALVOLIO And then I comes behind
FABIAN Ay an you had any eye behind you you might see more
detraction at your heels than fortunes before you
MALVOLIO M O A I This simulation is not as the former and
yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of
these letters are in my name Soft here follows prose
thee but be not afraid of greatness Some are born great some
Fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy
humble slough and appear fresh Be opposite with a kinsman surly
with servants let thy tongue tang arguments of state put
thyself into the trick of singularity She thus advises thee that
sighs for thee Remember who commended thy yellow stockings and
a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch
thee
Daylight and champain discovers not more This is open I will be
proud I will read politic authors I will baffle Sir Toby I
man I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for
every reason excites to this that my lady loves me She did
commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her
liking I thank my stars I am happy I will be strange stout in
putting on Jove and my stars be praised Here is yet a
postscript
become thee well Therefore in my presence still smile dear my
Jove I thank thee I will smile I will do everything that thou
wilt have me                                           Exit
FABIAN I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of
thousands to be paid from the Sophy
SIR TOBY I could marry this wench for this device
AGUECHEEK So could I too
SIR TOBY And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest
Enter MARIA
AGUECHEEK Nor I neither
SIR TOBY Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the
image of it leaves him he must run mad
MARIA Nay but say true does it work upon him
AIARIA If you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his
first approach before my lady He will come to her in yellow
fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now
be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a
melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable
contempt If you will see it follow me
SIR TOBY To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit

ACT III SCENE I
Enter VIOLA and CLOWN with a tabor
VIOLA Save thee friend and thy music
Dost thou live by thy tabor
CLOWN No sir I live by the church
VIOLA Art thou a churchman
CLOWN No such matter sir I do live by the church for I do live
at my house and my house doth stand by the church
VIOLA So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar
dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor
stand by the church
CLOWN You have said sir To see this age A sentence is but a
quickly make them wanton
CLOWN I would therefore my sister had had name sir
VIOLA Why man
might make my sister wanton But indeed words are very rascals
VIOLA Thy reason man
CLOWN Troth sir I can yield you none without words and words
are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them
CLOWN Not so sir I do care for something but in my conscience
sir I do not care for you If that be to care for nothing sir
I would it would make you invisible
CLOWN No indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly she will keep
no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands
indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words
shines everywhere I would be sorry sir but the fool should be
as oft with your master as with my mistress think I saw your
wisdom there
CLOWN Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send the a beard
within
CLOWN Would not a pair of these have bred sir
VIOLA Yes being kept together and put to use
CLOWN I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to bring a
Cressida to this Troilus
CLOWN The matter I hope is not great sir begging but a beggar
Cressida was a beggar My lady is within sir I will construe to
them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of
Exit CLOWN
VIOLA This fellow is wise enough to play the fool
And to do that well craves a kind of wit
He must observe their mood on whom he jests
The quality of persons and the time
And like the haggard check at every feather
That comes before his eye This is a practice
For folly that he wisely shows is fit
Enter SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW
SIR TOBY Save you gentleman
VIOLA And you sir
AGUECHEEK Dieu vous garde monsieur
VIOLA Et vous aussi votre serviteur
AGUECHEEK I hope sir you are and I am yours
SIR TOBY Will you encounter the house My niece is desirous you
should enter if your trade be to her
VIOLA I am bound to your niece sir I mean she is the list of my
voyage
SIR TOBY Taste your legs sir put them to motion
VIOLA My legs do better understand me sir than I understand what
you mean by bidding me taste my legs
SIR TOBY I mean to go sir to enter
VIOLA I will answer you with gait and entrance But we are
prevented
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
VIOLA My matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant
and vouchsafed car
three all ready
OLIVIA Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing
VIOLA My duty madam and most humble service
OLIVIA What is your name
VIOLA And he is yours and his must needs be yours
OLIVIA For him I think not on him for his thoughts
VIOLA Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts
On his behalf
OLIVIA O by your leave I pray you
I bade you never speak again of him
But would you undertake another suit
I had rather hear you to solicit that
Than music from the spheres
OLIVIA Give me leave beseech you I did send
After the last enchantment you did here
A ring in chase of you so did I abuse
Myself my servant and I fear me you
Under your hard construction must I sit
To force that on you in a shameful cunning
Which you knew none of yours What might you think
Have you not set mine honour at the stake
That tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving
Enough is shown a cypress not a bosom
Hides my heart So let me hear you speak
VIOLA I Pity YOU
That very oft we pity enemies
O world how apt the poor are to be proud
If one should be a prey how much the better
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time
Be not afraid good youth I will not have you
And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest
Your wife is like to reap a proper man
There lies your way due west
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship
OLIVIA Stay
VIOLA That you do think you are not what you are
OLIVIA If I think so I think the same of you
VIOLA Then think you right I am not what I am
OLIVIA I would you were as I would have you be
VIOLA Would it be better madam than I am
I wish it might for now I am your fool
OLIVIA O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
In the contempt and anger of his lip
Cesario by the roses of the spring
By maidhood honour truth and every thing
I love thee so that maugre all thy pride
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause
For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause
But rather reason thus with reason fetter
Love sought is good but given unsought is better
VIOLA By innocence I swear and by my youth
I have one heart one bosom and one truth
And that no woman has nor never none
Shall mistress be of it save I alone
And so adieu good madam never more
OLIVIA Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move
That heart which now abhors to like his love         Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter SIR TOBY SIR ANDREW and FABIAN
SIR TOBY Thy reason dear venom give thy reason
FABIAN You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew
orchard
SIR TOBY Did she see thee the while old boy Tell me that
AGUECHEEK As plain as I see you now
FABIAN This was a great argument of love in her toward you
FABIAN I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment
and reason
sailor
FABIAN She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to
exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in
your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have
laudable attempt either of valour or policy
hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician
SIR TOBY Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
him in eleven places My niece shall take note of it and assure
FABIAN There is no way but this Sir Andrew
AGUECHEEK Will either of you bear me a challenge to him
SIR TOBY Go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is
no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention
thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in
thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the
matter About it
AGUECHEEK Where shall I find you
Exit SIR ANDREW
FABIAN This is a dear manakin to you Sir Toby
or so
SIR TOBY Never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth
to an answer I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them
FABIAN And his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great
presage of cruelty
Enter MARIA
SIR TOBY Look where the youngest wren of nine comes
MARIA If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into
stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen a very
renegado for there is no Christian that means to be saved by
believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of
his face into more lines than is in the new map with the
augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such a thing as
favour
SIR TOBY Come bring us bring us where he is         Exeunt
SCENE III
A street
Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
SEBASTIAN I would not by my will have troubled you
But since you make your pleasure of your pains
I will no further chide you
ANTONIO I could not stay behind you my desire
More sharp than filed steel did spur me forth
But jealousy what might befall your travel
Being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
Unguided and unfriended often prove
Rough and unhospitable My willing love
The rather by these arguments of fear
Set forth in your pursuit
SEBASTIAN My kind Antonio
I can no other answer make but thanks
And thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns
But were my worth as is my conscience firm
Shall we go see the reliques of this town
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city
I do not without danger walk these streets
I did some service of such note indeed
SEBASTIAN Belike you slew great number of his people
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Might well have given us bloody argument
Most of our city did Only myself stood out
For which if I be lapsed in this place
I shall pay dear
SEBASTIAN Do not then walk too open
In the south suburbs at the Elephant
Is best to lodge I will bespeak our diet
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
With viewing of the town there shall you have me
SEBASTIAN Why I your purse
ANTONIO Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase and your store
I think is not for idle markets sir
An hour
SEBASTIAN I do remember                               Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
How shall I feast him What bestow of him
I speak too loud
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes
Where is Malvolio
MARIA No madam he does nothing but smile Your ladyship were
best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is
OLIVIA Go call him hither                         Exit MARIA
I am as mad as he
If sad and merry madness equal be
How now Malvolio
MALVOLIO Sweet lady ho ho
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion
MALVOLIO Sad lady I could be sad This does make some
If it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true
OLIVIA Why how dost thou man What is the matter with thee
MALVOLIO Not black in my mind though yellow in my legs
It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand
OLIVIA Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio
OLIVIA God comfort thee Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand
so oft
MARIA How do you Malvolio
MALVOLIO At your request Yes nightingales answer daws
MARIA Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady

Enter SERVANT

for the half of my dowry
Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA
MALVOLIO O ho do you come near me now No worse man than Sir
Toby to look to me This concurs directly with the letter she
sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him for she

that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle
that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my
hopes Well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be
thanked
SIR TOBY Which way is he in the name of sanctity If all the
MALVOLIO Go off I discard you Let me enjoy my private go off
MARIA Lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him Did not I tell
you Sir Toby my lady prays you to have a care of him
MALVOLIO Ah ha does she so
SIR TOBY Go to go to peace peace we must deal gently with him
MALVOLIO Do you know what you say
MARIA La you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes it at
heart Pray God he be not bewitched
MALVOLIO How now mistress
MARIA O Lord
SIR TOBY Prithee hold thy peace this is not the way Do you not
see you move him Let me alone with him
SIR TOBY Why how now my bawcock

MARIA Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray
MALVOLIO My prayers minx
MARIA No I warrant you he will not hear of godliness
MALVOLIO Go hang yourselves all You are idle shallow things I
am not of your element you shall know more hereafter
Exit

SIR TOBY His very genius hath taken the infection of the device
man
MARIA Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint
FABIAN Why we shall make him mad indeed
MARIA The house will be the quieter
our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime tired out of
breath prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of
madmen But see but see
Enter SIR ANDREW

sworn enemy

SIR TOBY Go Sir Andrew scout me for him at the corner of the
off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would
AGUECHEEK Nay let me alone for swearing                Exit
SIR TOBY Now will not I deliver his letter for the behaviour of
the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and
breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms
no less Therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant
will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a
clodpole But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of
mouth set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the
hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity This
will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the
look like cockatrices
FABIAN Here he comes with your niece give them way till he take
leave and presently after him
SIR TOBY I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a
challenge
Exeunt SIR TOBY FABIAN and MARIA
OLIVIA I have said too much unto a heart of stone
And laid mine honour too unchary out
But such a headstrong potent fault it is
That it but mocks reproof
VIOLA With the same haviour that your passion bears
Refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you
OLIVIA How with mine honour may I give him that
Which I have given to you
VIOLA I will acquit you
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell           Exit
SIR TOBY Gentleman God save thee
VIOLA And you sir
SIR TOBY That defence thou hast betake thee tot Of what nature
the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy
intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends
thee at the orchard end Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy
preparation for thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly
VIOLA You mistake sir I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me
my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence
done to any man
hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your
opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can
furnish man withal
VIOLA I pray you sir what is he
consideration but he is a devil in private brawl Souls and
is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of
VIOLA I will return again into the house and desire some conduct
of the lady I am no fighter I have heard of some kind of men
that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour
belike this is a man of that quirk
SIR TOBY Sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very
competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire
Back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with
me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on
certain or forswear to wear iron about you
VIOLA This is as uncivil as strange I beseech you do me this
courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him
is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose
SIR TOBY I Will do so Signior Fabian stay you by this gentleman
till my return                                Exit SIR TOBY
VIOLA Pray you sir do you know of this matter
arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more
VIOLA I beseech you what manner of man is he
FABIAN Nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form
as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour He is
indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that
you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria Will you
walk towards him I will make your peace with him if I can
rather go with sir priest than sir knight I care not who knows
so much of my mettle                                 Exeunt
firago I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he
gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is
inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet
hit the ground they step on They say he has been fencer to the
Sophy
SIR TOBY Ay but he will not now be pacified Fabian can scarce
hold him yonder
my horse grey Capilet
and looks pale as if a bear were at his heels
quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of
Therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he
will not hurt you
tell them how much I lack of a man
FABIAN Give ground if you see him furious
Enter ANTONIO
ANTONIO Put up your sword If this young gentleman
Have done offence I take the fault on me
If you offend him I for him defy you
SIR TOBY You sir Why what are you
ANTONIO One sir that for his love dares yet do more
Than you have heard him brag to you he will
SIR TOBY Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you
Enter OFFICERS
FABIAN O good Sir Toby hold Here come the officers
VIOLA Pray sir put your sword up if you please
as good as my word He will bear you easily and reins well
FIRST OFFICER This is the man do thy office
SECOND OFFICER Antonio I arrest thee at the suit
Of Count Orsino
ANTONIO You do mistake me sir
FIRST OFFICER No sir no jot I know your favour well
Take him away he knows I know him well
What will you do now my necessity
Makes me to ask you for my purse It grieves me
Much more for what I cannot do for you
But be of comfort
SECOND OFFICER Come sir away
ANTONIO I must entreat of you some of that money
VIOLA What money sir
And part being prompted by your present trouble
Out of my lean and low ability
ANTONIO Will you deny me now
Can lack persuasion Do not tempt my misery
Lest that it make me so unsound a man
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
That I have done for you
VIOLA I know of none
Nor know I you by voice or any feature
I hate ingratitude more in a man
Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
Inhabits our frail blood
ANTONIO O heavens themselves
SECOND OFFICER Come sir I pray you go
ANTONIO Let me speak a little This youth that you see here
And to his image which methought did promise
Most venerable worth did I devotion
ANTONIO But O how vile an idol proves this god
Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame
Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil
FIRST OFFICER The man grows mad Away with him
Come come sir
ANTONIO Lead me on                        Exit with OFFICERS
VIOLA Methinks his words do from such passion fly
That he believes himself so do not I
Prove true imagination O prove true
Yet living in my glass even such and so
In favour was my brother and he went
Still in this fashion colour ornament
For him I imitate O if it prove
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love        Exit
SIR TOBY A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a
hare His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in
necessity and denying him and for his cowardship ask Fabian
FABIAN A coward a most devout coward religious in it
SIR TOBY Do cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword
Exeunt

CLOWN Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you
SEBASTIAN Go to go to thou art a foolish fellow let me be clear
of thee
sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your
name is not Master Cesario nor this is not my nose neither
Nothing that is so is so
SEBASTIAN I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else
CLOWN Vent my folly He has heard that word of some great man and
now applies it to a fool Vent my folly I am afraid this great
lubber the world will prove a cockney I prithee now ungird

Exeunt SIR TOBY SIR ANDREW and FABIAN
I prithee gentle friend
Let thy fair wisdom not thy passion sway
In this uncivil and unjust extent
Against thy peace Go with me to my house
And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
Mayst smile at this Thou shalt not choose but go
Do not deny Beshrew his soul for me
He started one poor heart of mine in thee
SEBASTIAN What relish is in this How runs the stream
Or I am mad or else this is a dream

If it be thus to dream still let me sleep
SEBASTIAN Madam I will

Enter MARIA and CLOWN
MARIA Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard make him
Sir Toby the whilst                                    Exit
I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown I
am not tall enough to become the function well nor lean enough to
be thought a good student but to be said an honest man and a
good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a
great scholar The competitors enter
Enter SIR TOBY and MARIA
SIR TOBY Jove bless thee Master Parson

never saw pen and ink very wittily said to niece of King

SIR TOBY The knave counterfeits well a good knave
CLOWN Sir Topas the curate who comes to visit Malvolio the
lunatic
MALVOLIO Sir Topas Sir Topas good Sir Topas go to my lady

Talkest thou nothing but of ladies
SIR TOBY Well said Master Parson
MALVOLIO Sir Topas never was man thus wronged Good Sir Topas do
not think I am mad they have laid me here in hideous darkness
CLOWN Fie thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most modest
terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil
MALVOLIO As hell Sir Topas
CLOWN Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes and the
clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony and
yet complainest thou of obstruction
MALVOLIO I am not mad Sir Topas I say to you this house is dark
CLOWN Madman thou errest I say there is no darkness but
ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in
their fog
MALVOLIO I say this house is as dark as ignorance though
ignorance were as dark as hell and I say there was never man
in any constant question
CLOWN What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl
MALVOLIO That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird
MALVOLIO I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his
opinion
CLOWN Fare thee well Remain thou still in darkness thou shalt
fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy
grandam Fare thee well
MALVOLIO Sir Topas Sir Topas
SIR TOBY My most exquisite Sir Topas
CLOWN Nay I am for all waters
MARIA Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown he
sees thee not

in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety

light and convey what I will set down to my lady It shall
advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did
indeed or do you but counterfeit
MALVOLIO Believe me I am not I tell thee true

I am gone sir
And anon sir
In a trice
Like to the old Vice
Your need to sustain
Who with dagger of lath
In his rage and his wrath
Cries Ah ha to the devil
Like a mad lad
Pare thy nails dad
Adieu goodman devil                    Exit
SCENE III
Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN This is the air that is the glorious sun
I could not find him at the Elephant
Yet there he was and there I found this credit
That he did range the town to seek me out
His counsel now might do me golden service
For though my soul disputes well with my sense
That this may be some error but no madness
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance all discourse
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad
She could not sway her house command her followers
Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing
That is deceivable But here the lady comes
Enter OLIVIA and PRIEST
OLIVIA Blame not this haste of mine If you mean well
Now go with me and with this holy man
Into the chantry by there before him
And underneath that consecrated roof
Plight me the fun assurance of your faith
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
May live at peace He shall conceal it
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note
What time we will our celebration keep
According to my birth What do you say
And having sworn truth ever will be true
OLIVIA Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine
That they may fairly note this act of mine           Exeunt

ACT V SCENE I
Enter CLOWN and FABIAN
CLOWN Good Master Fabian grant me another request
FABIAN Anything
CLOWN Do not desire to see this letter
FABIAN This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog
again
Enter DUKE VIOLA CURIO and LORDS
DUKE Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends
CLOWN Ay sir we are some of her trappings
DUKE I know thee well How dost thou my good fellow
CLOWN Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my
friends
DUKE Just the contrary the better for thy friends
CLOWN No sir the worse
DUKE How can that be
CLOWN Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me Now my
foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by my foes sir I
profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused
so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make
your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and
the better for my foes
DUKE Why this is excellent
CLOWN By my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my
friends
make it another
DUKE O you give me ill counsel
CLOWN Put your grace in your pocket sir for this once and let
your flesh and blood obey it
CLOWN Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying
one two three
DUKE You can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you
will let your lady know I am here to speak with her and bring
her along with you it may awake my bounty further
CLOWN Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come again I go
sir but I would not have you to think that my desire of having
is the sin of covetousness But as you say sir let your bounty
take a nap I will awake it anon                       Exit
Enter ANTONIO and OFFICERS
VIOLA Here comes the man sir that did rescue me
DUKE That face of his I do remember well
As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war
A baubling vessel was he captain of
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable
With which such scathful grapple did he make
With the most noble bottom of our fleet
That very envy and the tongue of los
FIRST OFFICER Orsino this is that Antonio
That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy
And this is he that did the Tiger board
When your young nephew Titus lost his leg
Here in the streets desperate of shame and state
In private brabble did we apprehend him
VIOLA He did me kindness sir drew on my side
But in conclusion put strange speech upon me
What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
Hast made thine enemies
ANTONIO Orsino noble sir
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate
Though I confess on base and ground enough
That most ingrateful boy there by your side
Did I redeem a wreck past hope he was
His life I gave him and did thereto ad
My love without retention or restraint
All his in dedication for his sake
Did I expose myself pure for his love
Into the danger of this adverse town
Drew to defend him when he was beset
Where being apprehended his false cunning
Not meaning to partake with me in danger
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance
And grew a twenty years removed thing
While one would wink denied me mine own purse
Which I had recommended to his use
Not half an hour before
VIOLA How can this be
DUKE When came he to this town
Both day and night did we keep company
Enter OLIVIA and ATTENDANTS
DUKE Here comes the Countess now heaven walks on earth
But more of that anon Take him aside
OLIVIA What would my lord but that he may not have
Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable
Cesario you do not keep promise with me
VIOLA Madam
VIOLA My lord would speak my duty hushes me
OLIVIA If it be aught to the old tune my lord
It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
As howling after music
DUKE Still so cruel
OLIVIA Still so constant lord
DUKE What to perverseness You uncivil lady
To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
OLIVIA Even what it please my lord that shall become him
DUKE Why should I not had I the heart to do it
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death
That sometime savours nobly But hear me this
And that I partly know the instrument
That screws me from my true place in your favour
But this your minion whom I know you love
And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye
Come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief
VIOLA And I most jocund apt and willingly
To do you rest a thousand deaths would die
OLIVIA Where goes Cesario
VIOLA After him I love
More than I love these eyes more than my life
If I do feign you witnesses above
Punish my life for tainting of my love
VIOLA Who does beguile you Who does do you wrong
OLIVIA Hast thou forgot thyself Is it so long
Call forth the holy father                Exit an ATTENDANT
DUKE Come away
OLIVIA Whither my lord Cesario husband stay
DUKE Husband
OLIVIA Ay husband can he that deny
DUKE Her husband sirrah
VIOLA No my lord not I
OLIVIA Alas it is the baseness of thy fear
That makes thee strangle thy propriety
Fear not Cesario take thy fortunes up
Enter PRIEST
O welcome father
Father I charge thee by thy reverence
To keep in darkness what occasion now
PRIEST A contract of eternal bond of love
Attested by the holy close of lips
And all the ceremony of this compact
Since when my watch hath told me toward my grave
DUKE O thou dissembling cub What wilt thou be
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow
Farewell and take her but direct thy feet
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet
OLIVIA O do not swear
Hold little faith though thou has too much fear
Enter SIR ANDREW
AGUECHEEK For the love of God a surgeon
Send one presently to Sir Toby
AGUECHEEK Has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a
bloody coxcomb too For the love of God your help I had rather
than forty pound I were at home
OLIVIA Who has done this Sir Andrew
DUKE My gentleman Cesario
VIOLA Why do you speak to me I never hurt you
You drew your sword upon me without cause
But I bespake you fair and hurt you not
Enter SIR TOBY and CLOWN
AGUECHEEK If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me I think
you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb Here comes Sir Toby halting
you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink he would
Sot didst see Dick Surgeon sot
drunken rogue
OLIVIA Away with him Who hath made this havoc with them
together
Exeunt CLOWN FABIAN SIR TOBY and SIR ANDREW
Enter SEBASTIAN
SEBASTIAN I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman
But had it been the brother of my blood
I must have done no less with wit and safety
You throw a strange regard upon me and by that
I do perceive it hath offended you
Pardon me sweet one even for the vows
We made each other but so late ago
DUKE One face one voice one habit and two persons
A natural perspective that is and is not
SEBASTIAN Antonio O my dear Antonio
Since I have lost thee
ANTONIO Sebastian are you
ANTONIO How have you made division of yourself
An apple cleft in two is not more twin
Than these two creatures Which is Sebastian
OLIVIA Most wonderful
SEBASTIAN Do I stand there I never had a brother
Nor can there be that deity in my nature
Of here and everywhere I had a sister
Of charity what kin are you to me
What countryman what name what parentage
VIOLA Of Messaline Sebastian was my father
Such a Sebastian was my brother too
So went he suited to his watery tomb
If spirits can assume both form and suit
You come to fright us
SEBASTIAN A spirit I am indeed
But am in that dimension grossly clad
Which from the womb I did participate
Were you a woman as the rest goes even
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek
VIOLA My father had a mole upon his brow
SEBASTIAN And so had mine
VIOLA And died that day when Viola from her birth
SEBASTIAN O that record is lively in my soul
He finished indeed his mortal act
That day that made my sister thirteen years
VIOLA If nothing lets to make us happy both
Do not embrace me till each circumstance
Of place time fortune do cohere and jump
That I am Viola which to confirm
Where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help
All the occurrence of my fortune since
Hath been between this lady and this lord
But nature to her bias drew in that
You would have been contracted to a maid
If this be so as yet the glass seems true
I shall have share in this most happy wreck
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me
VIOLA And all those sayings will I overswear
And all those swearings keep as true in soul
As doth that orbed continent the fire
That severs day from night
DUKE Give me thy hand
VIOLA The captain that did bring me first on shore
OLIVIA He shall enlarge him Fetch Malvolio hither
And yet alas now I remember me
A most extracting frenzy of mine own
How does he sirrah
as a man in his case may do Has here writ a letter to you I
epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are
CLOWN Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the
OLIVIA How now Art thou mad
CLOWN No madam I do but read madness An your ladyship will have
it as it ought to be you must allow vox
CLOWN So I do madonna but to read his right wits is to read
thus therefore perpend my Princess and give ear
shall know it Though you have put me into darkness and given
your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my
senses as well as your ladyship I have your own letter that
induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not
but to do myself much right or you much shame Think of me as you
please I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of
my injury
OLIVIA Did he write this
CLOWN Ay Madam
DUKE This savours not much of distraction
Exit FABIAN
My lord so please you these things further thought on
To think me as well a sister as a wife
Here at my house and at my proper cost
him
So much against the mettle of your sex
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding
Here is my hand you shall from this time be
OLIVIA A sister You are she
DUKE Is this the madman
OLIVIA Ay my lord this same
How now Malvolio
MALVOLIO Madam you have done me wrong
Notorious wrong
OLIVIA Have I Malvolio No
MALVOLIO Lady you have Pray you peruse that letter
You must not now deny it is your hand
Write from it if you can in hand or phrase
You can say none of this Well grant it then
And tell me in the modesty of honour
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour
To put on yellow stockings and to frown
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people
And acting this in an obedient hope
Kept in a dark house visited by the priest
And made the most notorious geck and gul
OLIVIA Alas Malvolio this is not my writing
Though I confess much like the character
And now I do bethink me it was she
Upon thee in the letter Prithee be content
But when we know the grounds and authors of it
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
Of thine own cause
FABIAN Good madam hear me speak
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
Taint the condition of this present hour
Most freely I confess myself and Toby
Set this device against Malvolio here
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
In recompense whereof he hath married her
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge
the whirligig of time brings in his revenges
Exit
DUKE Pursue him and entreat him to a peace
He hath not told us of the captain yet
When that is known and golden time convents
A solemn combination shall be made
Of our dear souls Meantime sweet sister
We will not part from hence Cesario come
For so you shall be while you are a man
But when in other habits you are seen
Exeunt all but the CLOWN
CLOWN sings
When that I was and a little tiny boy
With hey ho the wind and the rain
A foolish thing was but a toy
For the rain it raineth every day
With hey ho the wind and the rain
For the rain it raineth every day
But when I came alas to wive
With hey ho the wind and the rain
By swaggering could I never thrive
For the rain it raineth every day
But when I came unto my beds
With hey ho the wind and the rain
For the rain it raineth every day
A great while ago the world begun
With hey ho the wind and the rain
Exit

SCENE
Verona Milan the frontiers of Mantua
ACT I SCENE I
Verona An open place
Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS
VALENTINE Cease to persuade my loving Proteus
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness
Even as I would when I to love begin
PROTEUS Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu
Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest
Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger
If ever danger do environ thee
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers
For I will be thy headsman Valentine
For he was more than over shoes in love
And yet you never swum the Hellespont
PROTEUS Over the boots Nay give me not the boots
VALENTINE No I will not for it boots thee not
PROTEUS What
With twenty watchful weary tedious nights
If haply won perhaps a hapless gain
If lost why then a grievous labour won
However but a folly bought with wit
Or else a wit by folly vanquished
PROTEUS So by your circumstance you call me fool
VALENTINE Love is your master for he masters you
And he that is so yoked by a fool
Methinks should not be chronicled for wise
PROTEUS Yet writers say as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all
VALENTINE And writers say as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes
But wherefore waste I time to counsel the
That art a votary to fond desire
Once more adieu My father at the road
PROTEUS And thither will I bring thee Valentine
VALENTINE Sweet Proteus no now let us take our leave
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend
And I likewise will visit thee with mine
PROTEUS All happiness bechance to thee in Milan
VALENTINE As much to you at home and so farewell
Exit VALENTINE
PROTEUS He after honour hunts I after love
He leaves his friends to dignify them more
I leave myself my friends and all for love
Made me neglect my studies lose my time
War with good counsel set the world at nought
Made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought
Enter SPEED
SPEED Sir Proteus save you Saw you my master
PROTEUS But now he parted hence to embark for Milan
PROTEUS Indeed a sheep doth very often stray
An if the shepherd be awhile away
SPEED You conclude that my master is a shepherd then and
I a sheep
PROTEUS I do
SPEED Why then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleep
PROTEUS A silly answer and fitting well a sheep
SPEED This proves me still a sheep
PROTEUS True and thy master a shepherd
SPEED Nay that I can deny by a circumstance
SPEED The shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the
shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks not me
therefore I am no sheep
PROTEUS The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for
food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master
thy master for wages follows not thee Therefore thou art a
sheep
for my labour
SPEED Nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your
letter
SPEED From a pound to a pin Fold it over and over
PROTEUS But what said she
SPEED You mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she
SPEED Now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for
your pains
PROTEUS No no you shall have it for bearing the letter
SPEED Well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you
PROTEUS Why sir how do you bear with me
SPEED Marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the
PROTEUS Beshrew me but you have a quick wit
SPEED And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse
PROTEUS Come come open the matter in brief what said she
SPEED Open your purse that the money and the matter may be both
at once delivered
PROTEUS Well sir here is for your pains What said she
PROTEUS Why couldst thou perceive so much from her
SPEED Sir I could perceive nothing at all from her no not so
much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to
hard as steel
PROTEUS What said she Nothing
whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir
PROTEUS Go go be gone to save your ship from wreck
Which cannot perish having thee aboard
I must go send some better messenger
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines
Receiving them from such a worthless post              Exit
SCENE II
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
JULIA But say Lucetta now we are alone
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love
LUCETTA Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully
JULIA Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
That every day with parle encounter me
In thy opinion which is worthiest love
According to my shallow simple skill
But were I you he never should be mine
LUCETTA Well of his wealth but of himself so so
LUCETTA Lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us
JULIA How now what means this passion at his name
That I unworthy body as I am
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen
JULIA Why not on Proteus as of all the rest
LUCETTA Then thus of many good I think him best
JULIA Your reason
I think him so because I think him so
JULIA And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him
LUCETTA Ay if you thought your love not cast away
LUCETTA Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye
JULIA His little speaking shows his love but small
JULIA They do not love that do not show their love
LUCETTA O they love least that let men know their love
JULIA I would I knew his mind
LUCETTA Peruse this paper madam
LUCETTA That the contents will show
JULIA Say say who gave it thee
He would have given it you but I being in the way
Did in your name receive it pardon the fault I pray
JULIA Now by my modesty a goodly broker
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines
To whisper and conspire against my youth
And you an officer fit for the place
Or else return no more into my sight
LUCETTA To plead for love deserves more fee than hate
JULIA Will ye be gone
LUCETTA That you may ruminate                           Exit
It were a shame to call her back again
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her
What fool is she that knows I am a maid
And would not force the letter to my view
Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love
That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence
When willingly I would have had her here
How angerly I taught my brow to frown
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past
What ho Lucetta
LUCETTA What would your ladyship
LUCETTA I would it were
That you might kill your stomach on your meat
And not upon your maid
LUCETTA Nothing
JULIA Why didst thou stoop then
LUCETTA To take a paper up that I let fall
JULIA And is that paper nothing
LUCETTA Nothing concerning me
JULIA Then let it lie for those that it concerns
LUCETTA Madam it will not lie where it concerns
Unless it have a false interpreter
JULIA Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme
LUCETTA That I might sing it madam to a tune
Give me a note your ladyship can set
JULIA As little by such toys as may be possible
LUCETTA It is too heavy for so light a tune
JULIA Heavy belike it hath some burden then
LUCETTA Ay and melodious were it would you sing it
JULIA And why not you
LUCETTA I cannot reach so high
How now minion
LUCETTA Keep tune there still so you will sing it out
And yet methinks I do not like this tune
JULIA You do not
JULIA You minion are too saucy
LUCETTA Nay now you are too flat
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song
LUCETTA Indeed I bid the base for Proteus
JULIA This babble shall not henceforth trouble me
Go get you gone and let the papers lie
O hateful hands to tear such loving words
Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings
As in revenge of thy ingratitude
I throw thy name against the bruising stones
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain
Poor wounded name my bosomas a bed
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss
Be calm good wind blow not a word away
Except mine own name that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea
Lo here in one line is his name twice writ
And yet I will not sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names
Thus will I fold them one upon another
Now kiss embrace contend do what you will
LUCETTA Madam
Dinner is ready and your father stays
JULIA Well let us go
JULIA If you respect them best to take them up
LUCETTA Nay I was taken up for laying them down
Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold
LUCETTA Ay madam you may say what sights you see
I see things too although you judge I wink
SCENE III
Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO
ANTONIO Tell me Panthino what sad talk was that
Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister
ANTONIO Why what of him
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home
While other men of slender reputation
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out
Some to the wars to try their fortune there
Some to discover islands far away
Some to the studious universities
For any or for all these exercises
He said that Proteus your son was meet
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home
Which would be great impeachment to his age
In having known no travel in his youth
Whereon this month I have been hammering
And how he cannot be a perfect man
And perfected by the swift course of time
Then tell me whither were I best to send him
PANTHINO I think your lordship is not ignorant
How his companion youthful Valentine
Attends the Emperor in his royal court
ANTONIO I know it well
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments
Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen
And be in eye of every exercise
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it
The execution of it shall make known
Even with the speediest expedition
With other gentlemen of good esteem
Are journeying to salute the Emperor
And to commend their service to his will
ANTONIO Good company with them shall Proteus go
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS Sweet love sweet lines sweet life
Here is her hand the agent of her heart
O that our fathers would applaud our loves
To seal our happiness with their consents
O heavenly Julia
ANTONIO How now What letter are you reading there
Of commendations sent from Valentine
ANTONIO Lend me the letter let me see what news
PROTEUS There is no news my lord but that he writes
And daily graced by the Emperor
Wishing me with him partner of his fortune
ANTONIO And how stand you affected to his wish
And not depending on his friendly wish
ANTONIO My will is something sorted with his wish
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed
For what I will I will and there an end
What maintenance he from his friends receives
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me
Excuse it not for I am peremptory
PROTEUS My lord I cannot be so soon provided
Please you deliberate a day or two
To hasten on his expedition
Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO
Lest he should take exceptions to my love
And with the vantage of mine own excuse
Hath he excepted most against my love
O how this spring of love resembleth
The uncertain glory of an April day
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun
And by an by a cloud takes all away
PANTHINO Sir Proteus your father calls for you
He is in haste therefore I pray you go
PROTEUS Why this it is my heart accords thereto

Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine
Ah Silvia Silvia
VALENTINE How now sirrah
SPEED She is not within hearing sir
VALENTINE Why sir who bade you call her
SPEED Your worship sir or else I mistook
SPEED And yet I was last chidden for being too slow
VALENTINE Go to sir tell me do you know Madam Silvia
SPEED She that your worship loves
VALENTINE Why how know you that I am in love
Sir Proteus to wreath your arms like a malcontent to relish a
A B C to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam
to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears
robbing to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas You were
walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently
on you I can hardly think you my master
VALENTINE Without me They cannot
simple none else would but you are so without these follies
that these follies are within you and shine through you like the
water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady
VALENTINE But tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia
SPEED She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper
SPEED Why sir I know her not
her not
SPEED Sir I know that well enough
VALENTINE What dost thou know
VALENTINE I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour
infinite
count
VALENTINE How painted and how out of count
SPEED Marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts
of her beauty
I see her beautiful
SPEED If you love her you cannot see her
VALENTINE Why
SPEED Because Love is blind O that you had mine eyes or your own
eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir
VALENTINE What should I see then
SPEED Your own present folly and her passing deformity for he
being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being
in love cannot see to put on your hose
VALENTINE Belike boy then you are in love for last morning you
could not see to wipe my shoes
SPEED True sir I was in love with my bed I thank you you
for yours
VALENTINE In conclusion I stand affected to her
SPEED I would you were set so your affection would cease

VALENTINE No boy but as well as I can do them
Enter SILVIA
Peace here she comes
Now will he interpret to her
VALENTINE Madam and mistress a thousand good morrows
SILVIA Sir Valentine and servant to you two thousand
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
But for my duty to your ladyship
VALENTINE Now trust me madam it came hardly off
For being ignorant to whom it goes
I writ at random very doubtfully
SILVIA Perchance you think too much of so much pains
VALENTINE No madam so it stead you I will write
Please you command a thousand times as much
SILVIA A pretty period Well I guess the sequel
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more
VALENTINE What means your ladyship Do you not like it
SILVIA Yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ
But since unwillingly take them again
VALENTINE Madam they are for you
SILVIA Ay ay you writ them sir at my request
But I will none of them they are for you
I would have had them writ more movingly
And if it please you so if not why so
VALENTINE If it please me madam what then
SILVIA Why if it please you take it for your labour
And so good morrow servant                     Exit SILVIA
SPEED O jest unseen inscrutable invisible
My master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor
He being her pupil to become her tutor
O excellent device Was there ever heard a better
That my master being scribe to himself should write the letter
VALENTINE How now sir What are you reasoning with yourself
VALENTINE To do what
SPEED To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia
VALENTINE To whom
SPEED To yourself why she woos you by a figure
VALENTINE What figure
SPEED By a letter I should say
VALENTINE Why she hath not writ to me
SPEED What need she when she hath made you write to yourself
Why do you not perceive the jest
VALENTINE No believe me
SPEED No believing you indeed sir But did you perceive her
earnest
VALENTINE She gave me none except an angry word
SPEED Why she hath given you a letter
VALENTINE I would it were no worse
Or else for want of idle time could not again reply
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover
All this I speak in print for in print I found it Why muse you
SPEED Ay but hearken sir though the chameleon Love can feed on
fain have meat O be not like your mistress Be moved be moved
Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter PROTEUS and JULIA
PROTEUS Have patience gentle Julia
JULIA I must where is no remedy
PROTEUS When possibly I can I will return
JULIA If you turn not you will return the sooner
JULIA And seal the bargain with a holy kiss
PROTEUS Here is my hand for my true constancy
Wherein I sigh not Julia for thy sake
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
My father stays my coming answer not
That tide will stay me longer than I should
Julia farewell                                  Exit JULIA
What gone without a word
Ay so true love should do it cannot speak
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it
Enter PANTHINO
PROTEUS Go I come I come
Alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb          Exeunt

SCENE IV
Enter SILVIA VALENTINE THURIO and SPEED
SILVIA Servant
VALENTINE Mistress
SPEED Master Sir Thurio frowns on you
SPEED Not of you
VALENTINE Of my mistress then
SILVIA Servant you are sad
VALENTINE Indeed madam I seem so
THURIO Seem you that you are not
VALENTINE Haply I do
THURIO So do counterfeits
VALENTINE So do you
THURIO What seem I that I am not
VALENTINE Wise
THURIO What instance of the contrary
VALENTINE Your folly
THURIO And how quote you my folly
VALENTINE I quote it in your jerkin
THURIO My jerkin is a doublet
THURIO How
SILVIA What angry Sir Thurio Do you change colour
VALENTINE Give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon
THURIO That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your
air
VALENTINE You have said sir
THURIO Ay sir and done too for this time
VALENTINE I know it well sir you always end ere you begin
SILVIA A fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off
SILVIA Who is that servant
VALENTINE Yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire Sir Thurio
borrows kindly in your company
THURIO Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall make your
wit bankrupt
VALENTINE I know it well sir you have an exchequer of words
and I think no other treasure to give your followers for it
appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words
Enter DUKE
SILVIA No more gentlemen no more Here comes my father
DUKE Now daughter Silvia you are hard beset
Sir Valentine your father is in good health
What say you to a letter from your friends
Of much good news
VALENTINE My lord I will be thankful
To any happy messenger from thence
DUKE Know ye Don Antonio your countryman
VALENTINE Ay my good lord I know the gentleman
To be of worth and worthy estimation
And not without desert so well reputed
DUKE Hath he not a son
VALENTINE Ay my good lord a son that well deserves
The honour and regard of such a father
DUKE You know him well
VALENTINE I knew him as myself for from our infancy
And though myself have been an idle truant
Omitting the sweet benefit of time
Made use and fair advantage of his days
His years but young but his experience old
His head unmellowed but his judgment ripe
And in a word for far behind his worth
Comes all the praises that I now bestow
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman
DUKE Beshrew me sir but if he make this good
Well sir this gentleman is come to me
With commendation from great potentates
And here he means to spend his time awhile
Silvia I speak to you and you Sir Thurio
For Valentine I need not cite him to it
I will send him hither to you presently           Exit DUKE
VALENTINE This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
Had come along with me but that his mistresss
Upon some other pawn for fealty
VALENTINE Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still
SILVIA Nay then he should be blind and being blind
How could he see his way to seek out you
VALENTINE Why lady Love hath twenty pair of eyes
THURIO They say that Love hath not an eye at all
VALENTINE To see such lovers Thurio as yourself
Upon a homely object Love can wink              Exit THURIO
Enter PROTEUS
SILVIA Have done have done here comes the gentleman
VALENTINE Welcome dear Proteus Mistress I beseech you
Confirm his welcome with some special favour
SILVIA His worth is warrant for his welcome hither
VALENTINE Mistress it is sweet lady entertain him
SILVIA Too low a mistress for so high a servant
PROTEUS Not so sweet lady but too mean a servant
To have a look of such a worthy mistress
VALENTINE Leave off discourse of disability
Sweet lady entertain him for your servant
PROTEUS My duty will I boast of nothing else
SILVIA And duty never yet did want his meed
Servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress
SILVIA That you are welcome
PROTEUS That you are worthless
THURIO Madam my lord your father would speak with you
SILVIA I wait upon his pleasure Come Sir Thurio
Go with me Once more new servant welcome
When you have done we look to hear from you
Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO
VALENTINE Now tell me how do all from whence you came
PROTEUS Your friends are well and have them much commended
VALENTINE And how do yours
PROTEUS I left them all in health
VALENTINE How does your lady and how thrives your love
PROTEUS My tales of love were wont to weary you
I have done penance for contemning Love
With bitter fasts with penitential groans
For in revenge of my contempt of love
And hath so humbled me as I confess
There is no woe to his correction
Nor to his service no such joy on earth
Now no discourse except it be of love
Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep
Upon the very naked name of love
PROTEUS Enough I read your fortune in your eye
Was this the idol that you worship so
VALENTINE Even she and is she not a heavenly saint
PROTEUS No but she is an earthly paragon
VALENTINE Call her divine
PROTEUS I will not flatter her
VALENTINE O flatter me for love delights in praises
PROTEUS When I was sick you gave me bitter pills
And I must minister the like to you
VALENTINE Then speak the truth by her if not divine
Yet let her be a principality
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth
PROTEUS Except my mistress
VALENTINE Sweet except not any
Except thou wilt except against my love
PROTEUS Have I not reason to prefer mine own
VALENTINE And I will help thee to prefer her too
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
And of so great a favour growing proud
And make rough winter everlastingly
PROTEUS Why Valentine what braggardism is this
VALENTINE Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing
She is alone
PROTEUS Then let her alone
VALENTINE Not for the world Why man she is mine own
And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee
Because thou seest me dote upon my love
My foolish rival that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge
Is gone with her along and I must after
PROTEUS But she loves you
With all the cunning manner of our flight
The ladder made of cords and all the means
Good Proteus go with me to my chamber
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel
PROTEUS Go on before I shall enquire you forth
I must unto the road to disembark
Some necessaries that I needs must use
VALENTINE Will you make haste
PROTEUS I will                                Exit VALENTINE
Even as one heat another heat expels
Or as one nail by strength drives out another
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten
Her true perfection or my false transgression
That makes me reasonless to reason thus
Bears no impression of the thing it was
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold
And that I love him not as I was wont
O but I love his lady too too much
How shall I dote on her with more advice
That thus without advice begin to love her
But when I look on her perfections
There is no reason but I shall be blind
If I can check my erring love I will
SCENE V
Milan A street
Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally
SPEED Launce by mine honesty welcome to Padua
LAUNCE Forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not welcome I
nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and
presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have
five thousand welcomes But sirrah how did thy master part with
Madam Julia
fairly in jest
SPEED But shall she marry him
LAUNCE No
SPEED How then Shall he marry her
LAUNCE No neither
SPEED What are they broken
LAUNCE No they are both as whole as a fish
SPEED Why then how stands the matter with them
LAUNCE Marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well
with her
SPEED What an ass art thou I understand thee not
LAUNCE What a block art thou that thou canst not My staff
understands me
staff understands me
SPEED It stands under thee indeed
LAUNCE Ask my dog If he say ay it will if he say no it will
if he shake his tail and say nothing it will
SPEED The conclusion is then that it will
LAUNCE Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a
parable
that my master is become a notable lover
LAUNCE I never knew him otherwise
SPEED Than how
LAUNCE A notable lubber as thou reportest him to be
LAUNCE Why fool I meant not thee I meant thy master
SPEED I tell thee my master is become a hot lover
LAUNCE Why I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love
If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an
Hebrew a Jew and not worth the name of a Christian
SPEED Why
LAUNCE Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to
the ale with a Christian Wilt thou go
SPEED At thy service                                  Exeunt
SCENE VI
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS To leave my Julia shall I be forsworn
To love fair Silvia shall I be forsworn
To wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn
Provokes me to this threefold perjury
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear
Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it
At first I did adore a twinkling star
But now I worship a celestial sun
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad
I cannot leave to love and yet I do
But there I leave to love where I should love
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose
If I keep them I needs must lose myself
If I lose them thus find I by their loss
For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia
I to myself am dearer than a friend
For love is still most precious in itself
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope
I will forget that Julia is alive
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend
I cannot now prove constant to myself
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
Myself in counsel his competitor
Of their disguising and pretended flight
For Thurio he intends shall wed his daughter
Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift            Exit
SCENE VII
Enter JULIA and LUCETTA
JULIA Counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
To lesson me and tell me some good mean
How with my honour I may undertake
A journey to my loving Proteus
LUCETTA Alas the way is wearisome and long
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps
And when the flight is made to one so dear
Of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus
LUCETTA Better forbear till Proteus make return
Pity the dearth that I have pined in
By longing for that food so long a time
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
As seek to quench the fire of love with words
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason
The current that with gentle murmur glides
But when his fair course is not hindered
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage
And so by many winding nooks he strays
With willing sport to the wild ocean
Then let me go and hinder not my course
And make a pastime of each weary step
Till the last step have brought me to my love
A blessed soul doth in Elysium
LUCETTA But in what habit will you go along
JULIA Not like a woman for I would prevent
The loose encounters of lascivious men
Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds
LUCETTA Why then your ladyship must cut your hair
To be fantastic may become a youth
Of greater time than I shall show to be
LUCETTA What fashion madam shall I make your breeches
LUCETTA You must needs have them with a codpiece madam
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on
But tell me wench how will the world repute me
For undertaking so unstaid a journey
LUCETTA If you think so then stay at home and go not
JULIA Nay that I will not
LUCETTA Then never dream on infamy but go
If Proteus like your journey when you come
JULIA That is the least Lucetta of my fear
A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears
And instances of infinite of love
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus
LUCETTA All these are servants to deceitful men
JULIA Base men that use them to so base effect
His words are bonds his oaths are oracles
His love sincere his thoughts immaculate
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth
To bear a hard opinion of his truth
Only deserve my love by loving him
And presently go with me to my chamber
To take a note of what I stand in need of
To furnish me upon my longing journey
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose
My goods my lands my reputation
Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence
Come answer not but to it presently
I am impatient of my tarriance                       Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Enter DUKE THURIO and PROTEUS
DUKE Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile
We have some secrets to confer about            Exit THURIO
PROTEUS My gracious lord that which I would discover
The law of friendship bids me to conceal
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me undeserving as I am
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me
Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend
This night intends to steal away your daughter
Myself am one made privy to the plot
On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates
It would be much vexation to your age
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than by concealing it heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down
Being unprevented to your timeless grave
DUKE Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care
Which to requite command me while I live
This love of theirs myself have often seen
Sir Valentine her company and my court
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man
I gave him gentle looks thereby to find
And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested
The key whereof myself have ever kept
How he her chamber window will ascend
And with a corded ladder fetch her down
For which the youthful lover now is gone
And this way comes he with it presently
Where if it please you you may intercept him
But good my lord do it so cunningly
That my discovery be not aimed at
For love of you not hate unto my friend
Hath made me publisher of this pretence
DUKE Upon mine honour he shall never know
That I had any light from thee of this
PROTEUS Adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming         Exit
Enter VALENTINE
DUKE Sir Valentine whither away so fast
VALENTINE Please it your Grace there is a messenger
That stays to bear my letters to my friends
And I am going to deliver them
DUKE Be they of much import
VALENTINE The tenour of them doth but signify
My health and happy being at your court
DUKE Nay then no matter stay with me awhile
I am to break with thee of some affairs
That touch me near wherein thou must be secret
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter
VALENTINE I know it well my lord and sure the match
Were rich and honourable besides the gentleman
Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter
Cannot your grace win her to fancy him
DUKE No trust me she is peevish sullen froward
Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father
And may I say to thee this pride of hers
Upon advice hath drawn my love from her
And where I thought the remnant of mine age
And turn her out to who will take her in
For me and my possessions she esteems not
VALENTINE What would your Grace have me to do in this
DUKE There is a lady in Verona here
Whom I affect but she is nice and coy
And nought esteems my aged eloquence
For long agone I have forgot to court
How and which way I may bestow myself
VALENTINE Win her with gifts if she respect not words
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
DUKE But she did scorn a present that I sent her
VALENTINE A woman sometime scorns what best contents her
But rather to beget more love in you
For why the fools are mad if left alone
Take no repulse whatever she doth say
Flatter and praise commend extol their graces
That man that hath a tongue I say is no man
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth
And kept severely from resort of men
That no man hath access by day to her
VALENTINE Why then I would resort to her by night
That no man hath recourse to her by night
VALENTINE What lets but one may enter at her window
DUKE Her chamber is aloft far from the ground
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
Without apparent hazard of his life
VALENTINE Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords
To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks
So bold Leander would adventure it
DUKE Now as thou art a gentleman of blood
Advise me where I may have such a ladder
VALENTINE When would you use it Pray sir tell me that
DUKE This very night for Love is like a child
That longs for everything that he can come by
DUKE But hark thee I will go to her alone
How shall I best convey the ladder thither
VALENTINE It will be light my lord that you may bear it
Under a cloak that is of any length
DUKE A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn
VALENTINE Ay my good lord
DUKE Then let me see thy cloak
VALENTINE Why any cloak will serve the turn my lord
DUKE How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak
I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me
And here an engine fit for my proceeding
And slaves they are to me that send them flying
O could their master come and go as lightly
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them
While I their king that thither them importune
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them
I curse myself for they are sent by me
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world
Wilt thou reach stars because they shine on thee
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates
And think my patience more than thy desert
Is privilege for thy departure hence
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court
By heaven my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself
Be gone I will not hear thy vain excuse
VALENTINE And why not death rather than living torment
Is self from self a deadly banishment
What light is light if Silvia be not seen
What joy is joy if Silvia be not by
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Silvia in the night
There is no music in the nightingale
Unless I look on Silvia in the day
There is no day for me to look upon
She is my essence and I leave to be
If I be not by her fair influence
I fly not death to fly his deadly doom
Tarry I here I but attend on death
But fly I hence I fly away from life
Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE
PROTEUS Run boy run run seek him out
PROTEUS What seest thou
Valentine
PROTEUS Valentine
VALENTINE No
PROTEUS Who then his spirit
VALENTINE Neither
PROTEUS What then
VALENTINE Nothing
LAUNCE Can nothing speak Master shall I strike
PROTEUS Who wouldst thou strike
LAUNCE Nothing
PROTEUS Villain forbear
PROTEUS Sirrah I say forbear Friend Valentine a word
PROTEUS Then in dumb silence will I bury mine
For they are harsh untuneable and bad
VALENTINE Is Silvia dead
PROTEUS No Valentine
VALENTINE No Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia
Hath she forsworn me
PROTEUS No Valentine
VALENTINE No Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me
What is your news
LAUNCE Sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished
From hence from Silvia and from me thy friend
VALENTINE O I have fed upon this woe already
And now excess of it will make me surfeit
Doth Silvia know that I am banished
A sea of melting pearl which some call tears
With them upon her knees her humble self
Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them
As if but now they waxed pale for woe
But neither bended knees pure hands held up
When she for thy repeal was suppliant
That to close prison he commanded her
With many bitter threats of biding there
Have some malignant power upon my life
If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear
As ending anthem of my endless dolour
PROTEUS Cease to lament for that thou canst not help
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good
Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love
Besides thy staying will abridge thy life
And manage it against despairing thoughts
Thy letters may be here though thou art hence
The time now serves not to expostulate
And ere I part with thee confer at large
Of all that may concern thy love affairs
Regard thy danger and along with me
VALENTINE I pray thee Launce an if thou seest my boy
Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate
PROTEUS Go sirrah find him out Come Valentine
VALENTINE O my dear Silvia Hapless Valentine
Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS
LAUNCE I am but a fool look you and yet I have the wit to think
one knave He lives not now that knows me to be in love yet I am
in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor
maid and serves for wages She hath more qualities than a
cannot fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a
with clean hands
Enter SPEED
SPEED How now Signior Launce What news with your mastership
SPEED Well your old vice still mistake the word What news
then in your paper
SPEED Why man how black
LAUNCE Why as black as ink
SPEED Let me read them
SPEED Thou liest I can
LAUNCE I will try thee Tell me this Who begot thee
SPEED Marry the son of my grandfather
LAUNCE O illiterate loiterer It was the son of thy grandmother
This proves that thou canst not read
SPEED Come fool come try me in thy paper
speed
LAUNCE Ay that she can

LAUNCE What need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can

her living
know not their fathers and therefore have no names
LAUNCE Close at the heels of her virtues
LAUNCE Well that fault may be mended with a breakfast

LAUNCE That makes amends for her sour breath
LAUNCE O villain that set this down among her vices To be slow

from her
LAUNCE I care not for that neither because I love crusts

another thing she may and that cannot I help Well proceed

SPEED And must I go to him
going will scarce serve the turn
SPEED Why didst not tell me sooner Pox of your love letters
Exit
SCENE II
Enter DUKE and THURIO
DUKE Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you
That I am desperate of obtaining her
DUKE This weak impress of love is as a figure
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot
Enter PROTEUS
How now Sir Proteus Is your countryman
According to our proclamation gone
PROTEUS Gone my good lord
DUKE My daughter takes his going grievously
PROTEUS A little time my lord will kill that grief
DUKE So I believe but Thurio thinks not so
Makes me the better to confer with thee
PROTEUS Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
Let me not live to look upon your Grace
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter
PROTEUS I do my lord
DUKE And also I think thou art not ignorant
How she opposes her against my will
PROTEUS She did my lord when Valentine was here
DUKE Ay and perversely she persevers so
What might we do to make the girl forget
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio
PROTEUS The best way is to slander Valentine
Three things that women highly hold in hate
PROTEUS Ay if his enemy deliver it
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend
DUKE Then you must undertake to slander him
PROTEUS And that my lord I shall be loath to do
Especially against his very friend
DUKE Where your good word cannot advantage him
Your slander never can endamage him
Therefore the office is indifferent
Being entreated to it by your friend
By aught that I can speak in his dispraise
She shall not long continue love to him
But say this weed her love from Valentine
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio
THURIO Therefore as you unwind her love from him
Lest it should ravel and be good to none
You must provide to bottom it on me
Which must be done by praising me as much
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine
DUKE And Proteus we dare trust you in this kind
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind
Upon this warrant shall you have access
For she is lumpish heavy melancholy
Where you may temper her by your persuasion
To hate young Valentine and love my friend
PROTEUS As much as I can do I will effect
But you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough
You must lay lime to tangle her desires
By wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes
DUKE Ay
PROTEUS Say that upon the altar of her beauty
You sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart
Write till your ink be dry and with your tears
Moist it again and frame some feeling line
That may discover such integrity
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands
With some sweet consort to their instruments
This or else nothing will inherit her
DUKE This discipline shows thou hast been in love
Let us into the city presently
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
To give the onset to thy good advice
DUKE About it gentlemen
And afterward determine our proceedings
DUKE Even now about it I will pardon you             Exeunt

ACT IV SCENE I
The frontiers of Mantua A forest
Enter certain OUTLAWS
FIRST OUTLAW Fellows stand fast I see a passenger
Enter VALENTINE and SPEED
THIRD OUTLAW Stand sir and throw us that you have about ye
SPEED Sir we are undone these are the villains
That all the travellers do fear so much
THIRD OUTLAW Ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man
VALENTINE Then know that I have little wealth to lose
My riches are these poor habiliments
Of which if you should here disfurnish me
You take the sum and substance that I have
SECOND OUTLAW Whither travel you
VALENTINE To Verona
FIRST OUTLAW Whence came you
VALENTINE From Milan
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me
VALENTINE I was
SECOND OUTLAW For what offence
VALENTINE For that which now torments me to rehearse
But yet I slew him manfully in fight
Without false vantage or base treachery
VALENTINE I was and held me glad of such a doom
SECOND OUTLAW Have you the tongues
VALENTINE My youthful travel therein made me happy
Or else I often had been miserable
This fellow were a king for our wild faction
VALENTINE Peace villain
SECOND OUTLAW Tell us this have you anything to take to
VALENTINE Nothing but my fortune
THIRD OUTLAW Know then that some of us are gentlemen
Thrust from the company of awful men
Myself was from Verona banished
For practising to steal away a lady
An heir and near allied unto the Duke
SECOND OUTLAW And I from Mantua for a gentleman
And partly seeing you are beautified
With goodly shape and by your own report
A linguist and a man of such perfection
Therefore above the rest we parley to you
To make a virtue of necessity
And live as we do in this wilderness
Love thee as our commander and our king
FIRST OUTLAW But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest
VALENTINE I take your offer and will live with you
Provided that you do no outrages
On silly women or poor passengers
THIRD OUTLAW No we detest such vile base practices
And show thee all the treasure we have got
Which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose       Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter PROTEUS
PROTEUS Already have I been false to Valentine
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio
Under the colour of commending him
I have access my own love to prefer
But Silvia is too fair too true too holy
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts
When I protest true loyalty to her
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend
When to her beauty I commend my vows
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips
The more it grows and fawneth on her still
Enter THURIO and MUSICIANS
But here comes Thurio Now must we to her window
And give some evening music to her ear
THURIO How now Sir Proteus are you crept before us
PROTEUS Ay gentle Thurio for you know that love
Will creep in service where it cannot go
THURIO Ay but I hope sir that you love not here
PROTEUS Sir but I do or else I would be hence
THURIO Who Silvia
THURIO I thank you for your own Now gentlemen
why is it
JULIA Marry mine host because I cannot be merry
JULIA But shall I hear him speak
JULIA That will be music
HOST Hark hark
JULIA Is he among these
SONG
Who is Silvia What is she
That all our swains commend her
Holy fair and wise is she
The heaven such grace did lend her
That she might admired be
Is she kind as she is fair
For beauty lives with kindness
Love doth to her eyes repair
To help him of his blindness
Then to Silvia let us sing
That Silvia is excelling
She excels each mortal thing
Upon the dull earth dwelling
HOST How now are you sadder than you were before
How do you man The music likes you not
JULIA You mistake the musician likes me not
HOST Why my pretty youth
JULIA He plays false father
HOST How out of tune on the strings
JULIA Not so but yet so false that he grieves my very
HOST You have a quick ear
JULIA Ay I would I were deaf it makes me have a slow heart
HOST I perceive you delight not in music
JULIA Not a whit when it jars so
HOST Hark what fine change is in the music
JULIA Ay that change is the spite
HOST You would have them always play but one thing
JULIA I would always have one play but one thing
But Host doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman
all nick
JULIA Where is Launce
command he must carry for a present to his lady
JULIA Peace stand aside the company parts
PROTEUS Sir Thurio fear not you I will so plead
That you shall say my cunning drift excels
THURIO Where meet we
THURIO Farewell                  Exeunt THURIO and MUSICIANS
Enter SILVIA above at her window
SILVIA I thank you for your music gentlemen
Who is that that spake
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice
SILVIA Sir Proteus as I take it
PROTEUS Sir Proteus gentle lady and your servant
PROTEUS That I may compass yours
SILVIA You have your wish my will is even this
That presently you hie you home to bed
To be seduced by thy flattery
Return return and make thy love amends
For me by this pale queen of night I swear
I am so far from granting thy request
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee
PROTEUS I grant sweet love that I did love a lady
But she is dead
For I am sure she is not buried
SILVIA Say that she be yet Valentine thy friend
Survives to whom thyself art witness
To wrong him with thy importunacy
PROTEUS I likewise hear that Valentine is dead
SILVIA And so suppose am I for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried
PROTEUS Sweet lady let me rake it from the earth
Or at the least in hers sepulchre thine
PROTEUS Madam if your heart be so obdurate
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love
The picture that is hanging in your chamber
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted I am but a shadow
And to your shadow will I make true love
And make it but a shadow as I am
SILVIA I am very loath to be your idol sir
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes
And so good rest
That wait for execution in the morn
Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA
JULIA Host will you go
HOST By my halidom I was fast asleep
JULIA Pray you where lies Sir Proteus
JULIA Not so but it hath been the longest night
SCENE III
Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind
Madam madam
Enter SILVIA above at her window
SILVIA Who calls
EGLAMOUR Your servant and your friend
SILVIA Sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow
EGLAMOUR As many worthy lady to yourself
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio whom my very soul abhors
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true love died
Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine
To Mantua where I hear he makes abode
And for the ways are dangerous to pass
I do desire thy worthy company
Upon whose faith and honour I repose
And on the justice of my flying hence
To keep me from a most unholy match
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues
I do desire thee even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands
To bear me company and go with me
If not to hide what I have said to thee
That I may venture to depart alone
EGLAMOUR Madam I pity much your grievances
I give consent to go along with you
Recking as little what betideth me
As much I wish all good befortune you
When will you go
SILVIA This evening coming
EGLAMOUR Where shall I meet you
Where I intend holy confession
EGLAMOUR I will not fail your ladyship Good morrow gentle lady
SILVIA Good morrow kind Sir Eglamour                 Exeunt
SCENE IV
Enter LAUNCE with his dog
from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and
sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say
as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no
cannot keep himself in all companies I would have as one should
say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it
were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to
take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been
judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt
Duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it
was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs
the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay
thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave
Didst thou ever see me do such a trick
PROTEUS Sebastian is thy name I like thee well
And will employ thee in some service presently
peasant
Where have you been these two days loitering
LAUNCE Marry sir I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me
PROTEUS And what says she to my little jewel
LAUNCE Marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish
thanks is good enough for such a present
LAUNCE No indeed did she not here have I brought him back
again
PROTEUS What didst thou offer her this from me
own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift
the greater
PROTEUS Go get thee hence and find my dog again
Away I say Stayest thou to vex me here        Exit LAUNCE
A slave that still an end turns me to shame
Sebastian I have entertained thee
Partly that I have need of such a youth
That can with some discretion do my business
But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour
Which if my augury deceive me not
Witness good bringing up fortune and truth
Therefore know thou for this I entertain thee
Go presently and take this ring with thee
She is dead belike
PROTEUS Not so I think she lives
JULIA Alas
JULIA I cannot choose
But pity her
PROTEUS Wherefore shouldst thou pity her
As you do love your lady Silvia
She dreams on him that has forgot her love
You dote on her that cares not for your love
PROTEUS Well give her that ring and therewithal
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture
Your message done hie home unto my chamber
Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary      Exit PROTEUS
JULIA How many women would do such a message
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs
Alas poor fool why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me
Because he loves her he despiseth me
Because I love him I must pity him
This ring I gave him when he parted from me
To bind him to remember my good will
And now am I unhappy messenger
To plead for that which I would not obtain
But cannot be true servant to my master
Unless I prove false traitor to myself
Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly
As heaven it knows I would not have him speed
Enter SILVIA attended
Gentlewoman good day I pray you be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia
SILVIA What would you with her if that I be she
JULIA If you be she I do entreat your patience
To hear me speak the message I am sent on
SILVIA From whom
JULIA From my master Sir Proteus madam
SILVIA O he sends you for a picture
JULIA Ay madam
SILVIA Ursula bring my picture there
Go give your master this Tell him from me
One Julia that his changing thoughts forget
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow
JULIA Madam please you peruse this letter
This is the letter to your ladyship
SILVIA I pray thee let me look on that again
JULIA It may not be good madam pardon me
SILVIA There hold
As easily as I do tear his paper
JULIA Madam he sends your ladyship this ring
SILVIA The more shame for him that he sends it me
For I have heard him say a thousand times
His Julia gave it him at his departure
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong
JULIA She thanks you
JULIA I thank you madam that you tender her
Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much
SILVIA Dost thou know her
JULIA Almost as well as I do know myself
To think upon her woes I do protest
That I have wept a hundred several times
SILVIA Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her
SILVIA Is she not passing fair
JULIA She hath been fairer madam than she is
She in my judgment was as fair as you
That now she is become as black as I
SILVIA How tall was she
JULIA About my stature for at Pentecost
As if the garment had been made for me
Therefore I know she is about my height
And at that time I made her weep a good
For I did play a lamentable part
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress moved therewithal
Wept bitterly and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow
SILVIA She is beholding to thee gentle youth
Alas poor lady desolate and left
I weep myself to think upon thy words
Here youth there is my purse I give thee this
Farewell                        Exit SILVIA with ATTENDANTS
A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful
Alas how love can trifle with itself
Here is her picture let me see I think
If I had such a tire this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers
Unless I flatter with myself too much
Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow
If that be all the difference in his love
Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself
If this fond Love were not a blinded god
Come shadow come and take this shadow up
And were there sense in his idolatry
My substance should be statue in thy stead
To make my master out of love with thee                Exit

ACT V SCENE I
Milan An abbey
Enter EGLAMOUR
EGLAMOUR The sun begins to gild the western sky
And now it is about the very hour
She will not fail for lovers break not hours
Unless it be to come before their time
So much they spur their expedition
Enter SILVIA
See where she comes Lady a happy evening
SILVIA Amen amen Go on good Eglamour
Out at the postern by the abbey wall
I fear I am attended by some spies
EGLAMOUR Fear not The forest is not three leagues off
If we recover that we are sure enough               Exeunt
SCENE II
Enter THURIO PROTEUS and JULIA as SEBASTIAN
THURIO Sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suit
PROTEUS O sir I find her milder than she was
And yet she takes exceptions at your person
THURIO What that my leg is too long
PROTEUS No that it is too little
THURIO What says she to my face
PROTEUS She says it is a fair one
THURIO Nay then the wanton lies my face is black
PROTEUS But pearls are fair and the old saying is
For I had rather wink than look on them
THURIO How likes she my discourse
PROTEUS Ill when you talk of war
THURIO But well when I discourse of love and peace
THURIO What says she to my valour
PROTEUS O sir she makes no doubt of that
THURIO What says she to my birth
THURIO Considers she my possessions
PROTEUS O ay and pities them
THURIO Wherefore
PROTEUS That they are out by lease
JULIA Here comes the Duke
Enter DUKE
DUKE How now Sir Proteus how now Thurio
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late
THURIO Not I
PROTEUS Nor I
DUKE Saw you my daughter
PROTEUS Neither
DUKE Why then
And Eglamour is in her company
Besides she did intend confession
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence
Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse
But mount you presently and meet with me
Upon the rising of the mountain foot
That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled
Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me               Exit
THURIO Why this it is to be a peevish girl
That flies her fortune when it follows her
Than for the love of reckless Silvia                   Exit
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her              Exit
JULIA And I will follow more to cross that love
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love            Exit
SCENE III
The frontiers of Mantua The forest
Enter OUTLAWS with SILVA
FIRST OUTLAW Come come
Be patient we must bring you to our captain
SILVIA A thousand more mischances than this one
SECOND OUTLAW Come bring her away
FIRST OUTLAW Where is the gentleman that was with her
But Moyses and Valerius follow him
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood
Fear not he bears an honourable mind
And will not use a woman lawlessly
SILVIA O Valentine this I endure for thee            Exeunt
SCENE IV
Another part of the forest
Enter VALENTINE
VALENTINE How use doth breed a habit in a man
This shadowy desert unfrequented woods
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns
Here can I sit alone unseen of any
Tune my distresses and record my woes
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless
Lest growing ruinous the building fall
And leave no memory of what it was
Repair me with thy presence Silvia
Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain
These are my mates that make their wills their law
Have some unhappy passenger in chase
They love me well yet I have much to do
To keep them from uncivil outrages
Enter PROTEUS SILVIA and JULIA as Sebastian
PROTEUS Madam this service I have done for you
Though you respect not aught your servant doth
To hazard life and rescue you from him
Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
And less than this I am sure you cannot give
Love lend me patience to forbear awhile
SILVIA O miserable unhappy that I am
PROTEUS Unhappy were you madam ere I came
But by my coming I have made you happy
SILVIA Had I been seized by a hungry lion
I would have been a breakfast to the beast
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me
O heaven be judge how I love Valentine
And full as much for more there cannot be
Therefore be gone solicit me no more
PROTEUS What dangerous action stood it next to death
Would I not undergo for one calm look
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths
Descended into perjury to love me
Than plural faith which is too much by one
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend
PROTEUS In love
Who respects friend
SILVIA All men but Proteus
PROTEUS Nay if the gentle spirit of moving words
Can no way change you to a milder form
SILVIA O heaven
VALENTINE Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch
Thou friend of an ill fashion
PROTEUS Valentine
For such is a friend now treacherous man
Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say
I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me
Is perjured to the bosom Proteus
I am sorry I must never trust thee more
But count the world a stranger for thy sake
The private wound is deepest O time most accurst
PROTEUS My shame and guilt confounds me
Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence
VALENTINE Then I am paid
And once again I do receive thee honest
Who by repentance is not satisfied
And that my love may appear plain and free
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee
PROTEUS Look to the boy
VALENTINE Why boy why wag how now
Silvia which out of my neglect was never done
PROTEUS Where is that ring boy
PROTEUS How let me see Why this is the ring I gave to Julia
JULIA O cry you mercy sir I have mistook
This is the ring you sent to Silvia
At my depart I gave this unto Julia
JULIA And Julia herself did give it me
And Julia herself have brought it hither
PROTEUS How Julia
JULIA Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root
O Proteus let this habit make thee blush
In a disguise of love
It is the lesser blot modesty finds
Women to change their shapes than men their minds
But constant he were perfect That one error
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins
VALENTINE Come come a hand from either
Let me be blest to make this happy close
PROTEUS Bear witness heaven I have my wish for ever
JULIA And I mine
Enter OUTLAWS with DUKE and THURIO
OUTLAW A prize a prize a prize
VALENTINE Forbear forbear I say it is my lord the Duke
Banished Valentine
DUKE Sir Valentine
VALENTINE Thurio give back or else embrace thy death
Come not within the measure of my wrath
Do not name Silvia thine if once again
Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love
THURIO Sir Valentine I care not for her I
I hold him but a fool that will endanger
His body for a girl that loves him not
I claim her not and therefore she is thine
DUKE The more degenerate and base art thou
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions
Now by the honour of my ancestry
I do applaud thy spirit Valentine
Know then I here forget all former griefs
Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again
To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine
VALENTINE I thank your Grace the gift hath made me happy
To grant one boon that I shall ask of you
Forgive them what they have committed here
They are reformed civil full of good
And fit for great employment worthy lord
Come let us go we will include all jars
With triumphs mirth and rare solemnity
VALENTINE And as we walk along I dare be bold
With our discourse to make your Grace to smile
What think you of this page my lord
DUKE I think the boy hath grace in him he blushes
DUKE What mean you by that saying
That you will wonder what hath fortuned
The story of your loves discovered
That done our day of marriage shall be yours
One feast one house one mutual happiness     Exeunt

ACT I SCENE I
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES
Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS
ARCHIDAMUS If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the
like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see
as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your
Sicilia
CAMILLO I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to
pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
ARCHIDAMUS Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
ARCHIDAMUS Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we
say We will give you sleepy drinks that your senses
unintelligent of our insufficience may though they cannot
praise us as little accuse us
ARCHIDAMUS Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
CAMILLO Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia They were
them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now
Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society their encounters though not
personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts
were from the ends of opposed winds The heavens continue their
loves
ARCHIDAMUS I think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it You have an unspeakable comfort of your young
Prince Mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that
ever came into my note
CAMILLO I very well agree with you in the hopes of him It is a
gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old
hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man
ARCHIDAMUS Would they else be content to die
CAMILLO Yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire
to live
ARCHIDAMUS If the King had no son they would desire to live on
crutches till he had one
Exeunt
SCENE II
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES
Enter LEONTES POLIXENES HERMIONE MAMILLIUS CAMILLO and ATTENDANTS
Without a burden Time as long again
And yet we should for perpetuity
Go hence in debt And therefore like a cipher
Yet standing in rich place I multiply
That go before it
LEONTES Stay your thanks a while
And pay them when you part
Or breed upon our absence that may blow
No sneaping winds at home to make us say
To tire your royalty
LEONTES We are tougher brother
POLIXENES No longer stay
POLIXENES Press me not beseech you so
So soon as yours could win me So it should now
Were there necessity in your request although
Do even drag me homeward which to hinder
Were in your love a whip to me my stay
To you a charge and trouble To save both
Farewell our brother
HERMIONE I had thought sir to have held my peace until
You had drawn oaths from him not to stay You sir
Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure
LEONTES Well said Hermione
HERMIONE To tell he longs to see his son were strong
But let him say so then and let him go
But let him swear so and he shall not stay
adventure the borrow of a week When at Bohemia
To let him there a month behind the gest
POLIXENES No madam
HERMIONE Nay but you will
POLIXENES I may not verily
HERMIONE Verily
You put me off with limber vows but I
Force me to keep you as a prisoner
Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
When you depart and save your thanks How say you
One of them you shall be
POLIXENES Your guest then madam
To be your prisoner should import offending
Which is for me less easy to commit
Than you to punish
HERMIONE Not your gaoler then
You were pretty lordings then
POLIXENES We were fair Queen
Two lads that thought there was no more behind
And to be boy eternal
HERMIONE Was not my lord
Was innocence for innocence we knew not
Hereditary ours
HERMIONE By this we gather
POLIXENES O my most sacred lady
Of my young playfellow
HERMIONE Grace to boot
Of this make no conclusion lest you say
Your queen and I are devils Yet go on
With any but with us
LEONTES Is he won yet
LEONTES At my request he would not
To better purpose
HERMIONE Never
LEONTES Never but once
As fat as tame things One good deed dying tongueless
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
My last good deed was to entreat his stay
What was my first It has an elder sister
Or I mistake you O would her name were Grace
LEONTES Why that was when
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
And clap thyself my love then didst thou utter
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods
I have tremor cordis on me my heart dances
But not for joy not joy This entertainment
May a free face put on derive a liberty
From heartiness from bounty fertile bosom
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers
My bosom likes not nor my brows Mamillius
Art thou my boy
MAMILLIUS Ay my good lord
They say it is a copy out of mine Come Captain
And yet the steer the heifer and the calf
Art thou my calf
MAMILLIUS Yes if you will my lord
To be full like me yet they say we are
Almost as like as eggs Women say so
That will say anything But were they false
To say this boy were like me Come sir page
Look on me with your welkin eye Sweet villain
Affection thy intention stabs the centre
Thou dost make possible things not so held
And that beyond commission and I find it
And that to the infection of my brains
POLIXENES What means Sicilia
HERMIONE He something seems unsettled
POLIXENES How my lord
HERMIONE You look
As if you held a brow of much distraction
LEONTES No in good earnest
How sometimes nature will betray its folly
Its tenderness and make itself a pastime
To harder bosoms Looking on the lines
Lest it should bite its master and so prove
As ornaments oft do too dangerous
How like methought I then was to this kernel
This squash this gentleman Mine honest friend
Will you take eggs for money
Are you so fond of your young prince as we
Do seem to be of ours
POLIXENES If at home sir
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
My parasite my soldier statesman all
And with his varying childness cures in me
Thoughts that would thick my blood
LEONTES So stands this squire
And leave you to your graver steps Hermione
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap
Apparent to my heart
HERMIONE If you would seek us
Though you perceive me not how I give line
Go to go to
How she holds up the neb the bill to him
And arms her with the boldness of a wife
To her allowing husband
Exeunt POLIXENES HERMIONE and ATTENDANTS
Gone already
Go play boy play thy mother plays and I
Will hiss me to my grave Contempt and clamour
Will be my knell Go play boy play There have been
And many a man there is even at this present
As mine against their will Should all despair
That hath revolted wives the tenth of mankind
It is a bawdy planet that will strike
From east west north and south Be it concluded
It will let in and out the enemy
MAMILLIUS I am like you they say
What Camillo there
CAMILLO Ay my good lord
Exit MAMILLIUS
Camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
CAMILLO You had much ado to make his anchor hold
When you cast out it still came home
LEONTES Didst note it
CAMILLO He would not stay at your petitions made
His business more material
LEONTES Didst perceive it
That he did stay
But so it is it is not Was this taken
By any understanding pate but thine
For thy conceit is soaking will draw in
But of the finer natures by some severals
Perchance are to this business purblind Say
CAMILLO Business my lord I think most understand
Bohemia stays here longer
LEONTES Ha
CAMILLO Stays here longer
LEONTES Ay but why
CAMILLO To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties
Of our most gracious mistress
LEONTES Satisfy
Let that suffice I have trusted thee Camillo
With all the nearest things to my heart as well
In that which seems so
CAMILLO Be it forbid my lord
Which hoxes honesty behind restraining
A servant grafted in my serious trust
And therein negligent or else a fool
CAMILLO My gracious lord
I may be negligent foolish and fearful
In every one of these no man is free
But that his negligence his folly fear
Among the infinite doings of the world
Sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord
It was my folly if industriously
Not weighing well the end if ever fearful
To do a thing where I the issue doubted
Whereof the execution did cry out
Which oft infects the wisest These my lord
Is never free of But beseech your Grace
Be plainer with me let me know my trespass
By its own visage if I then deny it
For to a vision so apparent rumour
Or else be impudently negative
My sovereign mistress clouded so without
My present vengeance taken Shrew my heart
You never spoke what did become you less
Than this which to reiterate were sin
As deep as that though true
LEONTES Is whispering nothing
Is leaning cheek to cheek Is meeting noses
Kissing with inside lip Stopping the career
Of breaking honesty Horsing foot on foot
Skulking in corners Wishing clocks more swift
Hours minutes noon midnight And all eyes
Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing
My is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
If this be nothing
CAMILLO No no my lord
LEONTES It is you lie you lie
I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee
Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
Or else a hovering temporizer that
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
Infected as her life she would not live
The running of one glass
CAMILLO Who does her
LEONTES Why he that wears her like her medal hanging
Had servants true about me that bare eyes
To see alike mine honour as their profits
Their own particular thrifts they would do that
Which should undo more doing Ay and thou
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
To give mine enemy a lasting wink
Which draught to me were cordial
CAMILLO Sir my lord
I could do this and that with no rash potion
Maliciously like poison But I cannot
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
So sovereignly being honourable
LEONTES Make that thy question and go rot
Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled
To appoint myself in this vexation sully
Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
Could man so blench
CAMILLO I must believe you sir
Will take again your queen as yours at first
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
Known and allied to yours
LEONTES Thou dost advise me
Even so as I mine own course have set down
CAMILLO My lord
Go then and with a countenance as clear
As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia
And with your queen I am his cupbearer
If from me he have wholesome beverage
Account me not your servant
LEONTES This is all
CAMILLO O miserable lady But for me
What case stand I in I must be the poisoner
Is the obedience to a master one
Who in rebellion with himself will have
All that are his so too To do this deed
Promotion follows If I could find example
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
Here comes Bohemia
Enter POLIXENES
POLIXENES This is strange Methinks
My favour here begins to warp Not speak
Good day Camillo
CAMILLO Hail most royal sir
CAMILLO None rare my lord
POLIXENES The King hath on him such a countenance
As he had lost some province and a region
With customary compliment when he
A lip of much contempt speeds from me
So leaves me to consider what is breeding
That changes thus his manners
CAMILLO I dare not know my lord
POLIXENES How dare not Do not Do you know and dare not
For to yourself what you do know you must
And cannot say you dare not Good Camillo
A party in this alteration finding
CAMILLO There is a sickness
Which puts some of us in distemper but
I cannot name the disease and it is caught
Of you that yet are well
POLIXENES How caught of me
Make me not sighted like the basilisk
As you are certainly a gentleman thereto
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
In ignorant concealment
CAMILLO I may not answer
POLIXENES A sickness caught of me and yet I well
I conjure thee by all the parts of man
Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
Is not this suit of mine that thou declare
What incidency thou dost guess of harm
Is creeping toward me how far off how near
Which way to be prevented if to be
If not how best to bear it
CAMILLO Sir I will tell you
That I think honourable Therefore mark my counsel
I mean to utter it or both yourself and me
Cry lost and so goodnight
POLIXENES On good Camillo
CAMILLO I am appointed him to murder you
POLIXENES By whom Camillo
CAMILLO By the King
POLIXENES For what
CAMILLO He thinks nay with all confidence he swears
Forbiddenly
POLIXENES O then my best blood turn
To an infected jelly and my name
Turn then my freshest reputation to
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
CAMILLO Swear his thought over
By each particular star in heaven and
By all their influences you may as well
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
As or by oath remove or counsel shake
The fabric of his folly whose foundation
The standing of his body
POLIXENES How should this grow
If therefore you dare trust my honesty
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
Your followers I will whisper to the business
And will by twos and threes at several posterns
My fortunes to your service which are here
By this discovery lost Be not uncertain
For by the honour of my parents I
I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
His execution sworn
POLIXENES I do believe thee
Be pilot to me and thy places shall
Still neighbour mine My ships are ready and
My people did expect my hence departure
Two days ago This jealousy
Must it be violent and as he does conceive
Good expedition be my friend and comfort
The gracious Queen part of this theme but nothing
I will respect thee as a father if
CAMILLO It is in mine authority to command
The keys of all the posterns Please your Highness
To take the urgent hour Come sir away             Exeunt

HERMIONE Take the boy to you he so troubles me
FIRST LADY Come my gracious lord
Shall I be your playfellow
FIRST LADY Why my sweet lord
I were a baby still I love you better
SECOND LADY And why so my lord
MAMILLIUS Not for because
Your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
Become some women best so that there be not
Too much hair there but in a semicircle
What colour are your eyebrows
FIRST LADY Blue my lord
That has been blue but not her eyebrows
FIRST LADY Hark ye
The Queen your mother rounds apace We shall
Present our services to a fine new prince
If we would have you
SECOND LADY She is spread of late
Into a goodly bulk Good time encounter her
HERMIONE What wisdom stirs amongst you Come sir now

HERMIONE Nay come sit down then on
Yond crickets shall not hear it
HERMIONE Come on then
Enter LEONTES ANTIGONUS LORDS and OTHERS
LEONTES he met there his train Camillo with him
FIRST LORD Behind the tuft of pines I met them never
Even to their ships
LEONTES How blest am I
In my just censure in my true opinion
In being so blest There may be in the cup
And yet partake no venom for his knowledge
Is not infected but if one present
How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
With violent hefts I have drunk and seen the spider
Camillo was his help in this his pander
There is a plot against my life my crown
For them to play at will How came the posterns
So easily open
FIRST LORD By his great authority
On your command
Give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him
Though he does bear some signs of me yet you
Have too much blood in him
HERMIONE What is this Sport
LEONTES Bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
Away with him and let her sport herself
Has made thee swell thus
LEONTES You my lords
Look on her mark her well be but about
The justice of your hearts will thereto ad
Which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
The shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
That mercy does for calumny will sear
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be
HERMIONE Should a villain say so
He were as much more villain you my lord
Do but mistake
LEONTES You have mistook my lady
Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing
Lest barbarism making me the precedent
Should a like language use to all degrees
And mannerly distinguishment leave out
Betwixt the prince and beggar I have said
A federary with her and one that knows
What she should shame to know herself
To this their late escape
HERMIONE No by my life
Privy to none of this How will this grieve you
When you shall come to clearer knowledge that
You scarce can right me throughly then to say
You did mistake
LEONTES No if I mistake
In those foundations which I build upon
The centre is not big enough to bear
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
But that he speaks
I must be patient till the heavens look
With an aspect more favourable Good my lords
I am not prone to weeping as our sex
Worse than tears drown Beseech you all my lords
With thoughts so qualified as your charities
Shall best instruct you measure me and so
My women may be with me for you see
My plight requires it Do not weep good fools
There is no cause when you shall know your mistress
As I come out this action I now go on
Is for my better grace Adieu my lord
I trust I shall My women come you have leave
LEONTES Go do our bidding hence
Exeunt HERMIONE guarded and LADIES
FIRST LORD Beseech your Highness call the Queen again
ANTIGONUS Be certain what you do sir lest your justice
Prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
Yourself your queen your son
FIRST LORD For her my lord
In this which you accuse her
ANTIGONUS If it prove
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her
For every inch of woman in the world
If she be
LEONTES Hold your peaces
ANTIGONUS It is for you we speak not for ourselves
I have three daughters the eldest is eleven
The second and the third nine and some five
And I had rather glib myself than they
Should not produce fair issue
LEONTES Cease no more
You smell this business with a sense as cold
As you feel doing thus and see withal
The instruments that feel
ANTIGONUS If it be so
We need no grave to bury honesty
Of the whole dungy earth
LEONTES What Lack I credit
FIRST LORD I had rather you did lack than I my lord
Upon this ground and more it would content me
To have her honour true than your suspicion
LEONTES Why what need we
Commune with you of this but rather follow
Our forceful instigation Our prerogative
Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
Relish a truth like us inform yourselves
We need no more of your advice The matter
Properly ours
ANTIGONUS And I wish my liege
You had only in your silent judgment tried it
Without more overture
LEONTES How could that be
Either thou art most ignorant by age
But only seeing all other circumstances
Cleomenes and Dion whom you know
They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
Shall stop or spur me Have I done well
FIRST LORD Well done my lord
LEONTES Though I am satisfied and need no more
Than what I know yet shall the oracle
Whose ignorant credulity will not
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
Be left her to perform Come follow us
We are to speak in public for this business
Will raise us all
If the good truth were known

May hold together On her frights and griefs
Which never tender lady hath borne greater
PAULINA A boy
EMILIA A daughter and a goodly babe
Lusty and like to live The Queen receives
PAULINA I dare be sworn
The trumpet any more Pray you Emilia
Commend my best obedience to the Queen
If she dares trust me with her little babe
The silence often of pure innocence
Persuades when speaking fails
EMILIA Most worthy madam
Your honour and your goodness is so evident
That your free undertaking cannot miss
A thriving issue there is no lady living
So meet for this great errand Please your ladyship
Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer
But durst not tempt a minister of honour
Lest she should be denied
PAULINA Tell her Emilia
I shall do good
EMILIA Now be you blest for it
I know not what I shall incur to pass it
Having no warrant
PAULINA You need not fear it sir
This child was prisoner to the womb and is
By law and process of great Nature thence
The anger of the King nor guilty of
If any be the trespass of the Queen
GAOLER I do believe it
PAULINA Do not you fear Upon mine honour I
Will stand betwixt you and danger                    Exeunt
SCENE III
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES
Enter LEONTES ANTIGONUS LORDS and SERVANTS
LEONTES Nor night nor day no rest It is but weakness
Is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
Given to the fire a moiety of my rest
FIRST SERVANT My lord
LEONTES How does the boy
LEONTES To see his nobleness
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother
Threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
The very thought of my revenges that way
And in his parties his alliance Let him be
Until a time may serve for present vengeance
Take it on her Camillo and Polixenes
Laugh at me make their pastime at my sorrow
They should not laugh if I could reach them nor
Enter PAULINA with a CHILD
FIRST LORD You must not enter
PAULINA Nay rather good my lords be second to me
Fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
More free than he is jealous
None should come at him
PAULINA Not so hot good sir
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
Nourish the cause of his awaking I
Do come with words as medicinal as true
Honest as either to purge him of that humour
That presses him from sleep
LEONTES What noise there ho
PAULINA No noise my lord but needful conference
About some gossips for your Highness
LEONTES How
Away with that audacious lady Antigonus
I knew she would
ANTIGONUS I told her so my lord
She should not visit you
LEONTES What canst not rule her
PAULINA From all dishonesty he can in this
He shall not rule me
ANTIGONUS La you now you hear
When she will take the rein I let her run
And I beseech you hear me who professes
Myself your loyal servant your physician
Your most obedient counsellor yet that dares
Less appear so in comforting your evils
From your good Queen
LEONTES Good Queen
And would by combat make her good so were I
A man the worst about you
LEONTES Force her hence
PAULINA Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
For she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
LEONTES Out
A most intelligencing bawd
PAULINA Not so
I am as ignorant in that as you
In so entitling me and no less honest
As this world goes to pass for honest
LEONTES Traitors
Will you not push her out Give her the bastard
By thy Dame Partlet here Take up the bastard
PAULINA For ever
Unvenerable be thy hands if thou
LEONTES He dreads his wife
LEONTES A nest of traitors
ANTIGONUS I am none by this good light
PAULINA Nor I nor any
For as the case now stands it is a curse
The root of his opinion which is rotten
As ever oak or stone was sound
LEONTES A callat
Of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
And now baits me This brat is none of mine
It is the issue of Polixenes
Hence with it and together with the dam
Commit them to the fire
PAULINA It is yours
Although the print be little the whole matter
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek his smiles
The very mould and frame of hand nail finger
And thou good goddess Nature which hast made it
So like to him that got it if thou hast
LEONTES A gross hag
That wilt not stay her tongue
ANTIGONUS Hang all the husbands
Hardly one subject
LEONTES Once more take her hence
PAULINA A most unworthy and unnatural lord
Can do no more
PAULINA I care not
It is an heretic that makes the fire
Not able to produce more accusation
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you
Yea scandalous to the world
LEONTES On your allegiance
Out of the chamber with her Were I a tyrant
Where were her life She durst not call me so
If she did know me one Away with her
A better guiding spirit What needs these hands
Will never do him good not one of you
So so Farewell we are gone                          Exit
LEONTES Thou traitor hast set on thy wife to this
Even thou and none but thou Take it up straight
And wilt encounter with my wrath say so
The bastard brains with these my proper hands
Shall I dash out Go take it to the fire
ANTIGONUS I did not sir
These lords my noble fellows if they please
LORDS We can My royal liege
He is not guilty of her coming hither
FIRST LORD Beseech your Highness give us better credit
So to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
As recompense of our dear services
Past and to come that you do change this purpose
Which being so horrible so bloody must
Lead on to some foul issue We all kneel
LEONTES I am a feather for each wind that blows
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
And call me father Better burn it now
Than curse it then But be it let it live
You that have been so tenderly officious
With Lady Margery your midwife there
ANTIGONUS Anything my lord
That my ability may undergo
And nobleness impose At least thus much
LEONTES It shall be possible Swear by this sword
Thou wilt perform my bidding
ANTIGONUS I will my lord
Whom for this time we pardon We enjoin thee
As thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions and that there thou leave it
Without more mercy to it own protection
And favour of the climate As by strange fortune
It came to us I do in justice charge thee
That thou commend it strangely to some place
Where chance may nurse or end it Take it up
ANTIGONUS I swear to do this though a present death
Had been more merciful Come on poor babe
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
To be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say
Casting their savageness aside have done
Like offices of pity Sir be prosperous
In more than this deed does require And blessing
Against this cruelty fight on thy side
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT Please your Highness posts
An hour since Cleomenes and Dion
FIRST LORD So please you sir their speed
Hath been beyond account
The great Apollo suddenly will have
The truth of this appear Prepare you lords
Summon a session that we may arraign
Our most disloyal lady for as she hath
A just and open trial While she lives
My heart will be a burden to me Leave me
And think upon my bidding                            Exeunt

ACT III SCENE I
Sicilia On the road to the Capital
Enter CLEOMENES and DION
Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
The common praise it bears
DION I shall report
Of the grave wearers O the sacrifice
How ceremonious solemn and unearthly
CLEOMENES But of all the burst
That I was nothing
As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
CLEOMENES Great Apollo
So forcing faults upon Hermione
I little like
DION The violent carriage of it
Shall the contents discover something rare
Even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses
And gracious be the issue                            Exeunt
SCENE II
Sicilia A court of justice
Enter LEONTES LORDS and OFFICERS
LEONTES This sessions to our great grief we pronounce
The daughter of a king our wife and one
Of being tyrannous since we so openly
Proceed in justice which shall have due course
Even to the guilt or the purgation
Produce the prisoner
Appear in person here in court
Enter HERMIONE as to her trial PAULINA and LADIES
Silence
LEONTES Read the indictment
Sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in
committing adultery with Polixenes King of Bohemia and
conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
lord the King thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by
circumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the
faith and allegiance of true subject didst counsel and aid them
HERMIONE Since what I am to say must be but that
Which contradicts my accusation and
The testimony on my part no other
But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
Being counted falsehood shall as I express it
Behold our human actions as they do
I doubt not then but innocence shall make
False accusation blush and tyranny
Hath been as continent as chaste as true
As I am now unhappy which is more
A fellow of the royal bed which owe
To prate and talk for life and honour fore
Who please to come and hear For life I prize it
As I weigh grief which I would spare for honour
And only that I stand for I appeal
To your own conscience sir before Polixenes
Came to your court how I was in your grace
How merited to be so since he came
With what encounter so uncurrent I
The bound of honour or in act or will
Cry fie upon my grave
That any of these bolder vices wanted
Less impudence to gainsay what they did
Than to perform it first
LEONTES You will not own it
HERMIONE More than mistress of
Which comes to me in name of fault I must not
At all acknowledge For Polixenes
With such a kind of love as might become
A lady like me with a love even such
So and no other as yourself commanded
Which not to have done I think had been in me
Both disobedience and ingratitude
To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
Ever since it could speak from an infant freely
That it was yours Now for conspiracy
For me to try how all I know of it
Is that Camillo was an honest man
And why he left your court the gods themselves
Wotting no more than I are ignorant
LEONTES You knew of his departure as you know
HERMIONE Sir
You speak a language that I understand not
My life stands in the level of your dreams
LEONTES Your actions are my dreams
You had a bastard by Polixenes
Which to deny concerns more than avails for as
Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
Look for no less than death
HERMIONE Sir spare your threats
The bug which you would fright me with I seek
To me can life be no commodity
The crown and comfort of my life your favour
I do give lost for I do feel it gone
But know not how it went my second joy
And first fruits of my body from his presence
To women of all fashion lastly hurried
I have got strength of limit Now my liege
Tell me what blessings I have here alive
That I should fear to die Therefore proceed
I prize it not a straw but for mine honour
Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
But what your jealousies awake I tell you
I do refer me to the oracle
Apollo be my judge
FIRST LORD This your request
Is altogether just Therefore bring forth
Exeunt certain OFFICERS
HERMIONE The Emperor of Russia was my father
O that he were alive and here beholding
The flatness of my misery yet with eyes
Of pity not revenge
OFFICER You here shall swear upon this sword of justice
That you Cleomenes and Dion have
Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought
CLEOMENES DION All this we swear
LEONTES Break up the seals and read
Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent
babe truly begotten and the King shall live without an heir if
LORDS Now blessed be the great Apollo
HERMIONE Praised
LEONTES Hast thou read truth
OFFICER Ay my lord even so
As it is here set down
The sessions shall proceed This is mere falsehood
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT My lord the King the King
LEONTES What is the business
SERVANT O sir I shall be hated to report it
The Prince your son with mere conceit and fear
LEONTES How Gone
SERVANT Is dead
How now there
PAULINA This news is mortal to the Queen Look down
And see what death is doing
LEONTES Take her hence
Beseech you tenderly apply to her
Some remedies for life
Exeunt PAULINA and LADIES with HERMIONE
Apollo pardon
Whom I proclaim a man of truth of mercy
For being transported by my jealousies
To bloody thoughts and to revenge I chose
Camillo for the minister to poison
My friend Polixenes which had been done
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
My swift command though I with death and with
Reward did threaten and encourage him
Not doing it and being done He most humane
Which you knew great and to the certain hazard
Of all incertainties himself commended
No richer than his honour How he glisters
Thorough my rust And how his piety
Does my deeds make the blacker
PAULINA Woe the while
O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
Break too
FIRST LORD What fit is this good lady
PAULINA What studied torments tyrant hast for me
What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
In leads or oils What old or newer torture
Must I receive whose every word deserves
To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny
Together working with thy jealousies
Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
And then run mad indeed stark mad for all
That did but show thee of a fool inconstant
More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon
The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter
To be or none or little though a devil
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
Prevail not go and see If you can bring
Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
As I would do the gods But O thou tyrant
Do not repent these things for they are heavier
Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
To nothing but despair A thousand knees
Ten thousand years together naked fasting
Upon a barren mountain and still winter
In storm perpetual could not move the gods
To look that way thou wert
LEONTES Go on go on
FIRST LORD Say no more
All faults I make when I shall come to know them
Should be past grief Do not receive affliction
At my petition I beseech you rather
Of what you should forget Now good my liege
Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman
Who is lost too Take your patience to you
LEONTES Thou didst speak but well
When most the truth which I receive much better
Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me
To the dead bodies of my queen and son
One grave shall be for both Upon them shall
The causes of their death appear unto
The chapel where they lie and tears shed there
Shall be my recreation So long as nature
Will bear up with this exercise so long
I daily vow to use it Come and lead me
To these sorrows                                     Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter ANTIGONUS with the CHILD and a MARINER
The deserts of Bohemia
MARINER Ay my lord and fear
We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly
And threaten present blusters In my conscience
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
ANTIGONUS Their sacred wills be done Go get aboard
I call upon thee
MARINER Make your best haste and go not
Besides this place is famous for the creatures
ANTIGONUS Go thou away
MARINER I am glad at heart
ANTIGONUS Come poor babe
May walk again If such thing be thy mother
So like a waking To me comes a creature
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow
Like very sanctity she did approach
And gasping to begin some speech her eyes
Became two spouts the fury spent anon
Since fate against thy better disposition
Of my poor babe according to thine oath
Places remote enough are in Bohemia
There weep and leave it crying and for the babe
Is counted lost for ever Perdita
She melted into air Affrighted much
I did in time collect myself and thought
This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys
Yet for this once yea superstitiously
Apollo would this being indeed the issue
Of King Polixenes it should here be laid
Either for life or death upon the earth
Of its right father Blossom speed thee well
There lie and there thy character there these
Which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
And still rest thine The storm begins Poor wretch
To loss and what may follow Weep I cannot
A lullaby too rough I never saw
clamour
Well may I get aboard This is the chase
I am gone for ever                  Exit pursued by a bear
Enter an old SHEPHERD
SHEPHERD I would there were no age between ten and three and
twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is
nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging
fear the wolf will sooner find than the master If any where I
Enter CLOWN
CLOWN Hilloa loa

SHEPHERD Why boy how is it
CLOWN I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it
or weather
SHEPHERD Name of mercy when was this boy
SHEPHERD Heavy matters heavy matters But look thee here boy
keep it close Home home the next way We are lucky boy and
to be so still requires nothing but secrecy Let my sheep go
Come good boy the next way home
bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten They
are never curst but when they are hungry If there be any of him

Enter TIME the CHORUS
TIME I that please some try all both joy and terror
Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
Now take upon me in the name of Time
To use my wings Impute it not a crime
To me or my swift passage that I slide
The times that brought them in so shall I do
The glistering of this present as my tale
Now seems to it Your patience this allowing
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
Gentle spectators that I now may be
In fair Bohemia and remember well
I now name to you and with speed so pace
To speak of Perdita now grown in grace
And what to her adheres which follows after
If ever you have spent time worse ere now
If never yet that Time himself doth say
He wishes earnestly you never may                      Exit
SCENE II
Bohemia The palace of POLIXENES
Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO
a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this
CAMILLO It is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have
for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones
there Besides the penitent King my master hath sent for me
think so which is another spur to my departure
services by leaving me now The need I have of thee thine own
goodness hath made Better not to have had thee than thus to want
thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or
take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I
thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the
heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee
speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance
brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are
Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue
not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have
approved their virtues
CAMILLO Sir it is three days since I saw the Prince What his
happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly
noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent
to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared
POLIXENES I have considered so much Camillo and with some care
so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his
removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is
that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
CAMILLO I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of
most rare note The report of her is extended more than can be
thought to begin from such a cottage
angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the
place where we will not appearing what we are have some
question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not
present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of
Sicilia
CAMILLO I willingly obey your command
POLIXENES My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves
Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter AUTOLYCUS singing
When daffodils begin to peer
With heigh the doxy over the dale
The white sheet bleaching on the hedge
With heigh the sweet birds O how they sing
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king
With heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
Are summer songs for me and my aunts
While we lie tumbling in the hay
but now I am out of service
But shall I go mourn for that my dear
The pale moon shines by night
And when I wander here and there
I then do most go right
If tinkers may have leave to live
Then my account I well may give
And in the stocks avouch it
My traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to lesser linen
beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come I
sleep out the thought of it A prize a prize
Enter CLOWN

nutmegs seven race or two of ginger but that I may beg four
AUTOLYCUS O help me help me Pluck but off these rags and then
death death
CLOWN Alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on
thee rather than have these off
AUTOLYCUS O sir the loathsomeness of them offend me more than the
stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions
CLOWN Alas poor man a million of beating may come to a great
matter
from me and these detestable things put upon me
CLOWN What by a horseman or a footman
AUTOLYCUS A footman sweet sir a footman
CLOWN Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left
AUTOLYCUS O good sir tenderly O
CLOWN Alas poor soul
AUTOLYCUS O good sir softly good sir I fear sir my shoulder

CLOWN Dost lack any money I have a little money for thee
AUTOLYCUS No good sweet sir no I beseech you sir I have a
kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom I was
going I shall there have money or anything I want Offer me no
money I pray you that kills my heart
AUTOLYCUS A fellow sir that I have known to go about with

more but abide
AUTOLYCUS Vices I would say sir I know this man well he hath
wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having
flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue
Some call him Autolycus
CLOWN Out upon him prig for my life prig He haunts wakes

Jog on jog on the footpath way
A merry heart goes all the day
SCENE IV
Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA
FLORIZEL These your unusual weeds to each part of you
Is as a meeting of the petty gods
PERDITA Sir my gracious lord
O pardon that I name them Your high self
In every mess have folly and the feeders
Digest it with a custom I should blush
To show myself a glass
FLORIZEL I bless the time
When my good falcon made her flight across
PERDITA Now Jove afford you cause
To me the difference forges dread your greatness
To think your father by some accident
Should pass this way as you did O the Fates
How would he look to see his work so noble
Vilely bound up What would he say Or how
Should I in these my borrowed flaunts behold
The sternness of his presence
FLORIZEL Apprehend
Nothing but jollity The gods themselves
Humbling their deities to love have taken
The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter
Golden Apollo a poor humble swain
As I seem now Their transformations
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer
Nor in a way so chaste since my desires
Run not before mine honour nor my lusts
Burn hotter than my faith
PERDITA O but sir
One of these two must be necessities
Which then will speak that you must change this purpose
Or I my life
FLORIZEL Thou dearest Perdita
Mine own nor anything to any if
I be not thine To this I am most constant
Though destiny say no Be merry gentle
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
That you behold the while Your guests are coming
Lift up your countenance as it were the day
Of celebration of that nuptial which
We two have sworn shall come
PERDITA O Lady Fortune
Stand you auspicious
FLORIZEL See your guests approach
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly
Enter SHEPHERD with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised
CLOWN MOPSA DORCAS with OTHERS
This day she was both pantler butler cook
Would sing her song and dance her turn now here
With labour and the thing she took to quench it
She would to each one sip You are retired
As if you were a feasted one and not
The hostess of the meeting Pray you bid
A way to make us better friends more known
Come quench your blushes and present yourself
As your good flock shall prosper
Seeming and savour all the winter long
Grace and remembrance be to you both
And welcome to our shearing
PERDITA Sir the year growing ancient
To get slips of them
POLIXENES Wherefore gentle maiden
Do you neglect them
PERDITA For I have heard it said
There is an art which in their piedness shares
With great creating nature
POLIXENES Say there be
Yet nature is made better by no mean
But nature makes that mean so over that art
Which you say adds to nature is an art
That nature makes You see sweet maid we marry
A gentler scion to the wildest stock
And make conceive a bark of baser kind
By bud of nobler race This is an art
The art itself is nature
PERDITA So it is
POLIXENES Then make your garden rich in gillyvors
And do not call them bastards
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them
No more than were I painted I would wish
Hot lavender mints savory marjoram
Of middle summer and I think they are given
CAMILLO I should leave grazing were I of your flock
And only live by gazing
PERDITA Out alas
That wear upon your virgin branches yet
Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina
That come before the swallow dares and take
The winds of March with beauty violets dim
That die unmarried ere they can behold
Most incident to maids bold oxlips and
To make you garlands of and my sweet friend
FLORIZEL What like a corse
PERDITA No like a bank for love to lie and play on
Methinks I play as I have seen them do
In Whitsun pastorals Sure this robe of mine
Does change my disposition
FLORIZEL What you do
Still betters what is done When you speak sweet
To sing them too When you do dance I wish you
Nothing but that move still still so
And own no other function Each your doing
So singular in each particular
Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds
That all your acts are queens
PERDITA O Doricles
Your praises are too large But that your youth
With wisdom I might fear my Doricles
FLORIZEL I think you have
As little skill to fear as I have purpose
Your hand my Perdita so turtles pair
That never mean to part
But smacks of something greater than herself
Too noble for this place
CAMILLO He tells her something
That makes her blood look out Good sooth she is
The queen of curds and cream
CLOWN Come on strike up
DORCAS Mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic
To mend her kissing with
MOPSA Now in good time
CLOWN Not a word a word we stand upon our manners

Which dances with your daughter
SHEPHERD They call him Doricles and boasts himself
To have a worthy feeding but I have it
Upon his own report and I believe it
He looks like sooth He says he loves my daughter
I think there is not half a kiss to choose
Who loves another best
POLIXENES She dances featly
SHEPHERD So she does any thing though I report it
That should be silent If young Doricles
Do light upon her she shall bring him that
Which he not dreams of
Enter a SERVANT
SERVANT O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you
would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe
ears grew to his tunes
CLOWN He could never come better he shall come in I love a
ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set
down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably
SERVANT He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner
can so fit his customers with gloves He has the prettiest
mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the
POLIXENES This is a brave fellow
CLOWN Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow
Has he any unbraided wares

CLOWN Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
Exit SERVANT

Golden quoifs and stomachers
For my lads to give their dears
What maids lack from head to heel
Come buy of me come come buy come buy
Buy lads or else your lasses cry

CLOWN If I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take no
bondage of certain ribbons and gloves

CLOWN Is there no manners left among maids Will they wear their
plackets where they should bear their faces Is there not
not a word more
of sweet gloves

AUTOLYCUS And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it
behoves men to be wary
CLOWN Fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here
AUTOLYCUS I hope so sir for I have about me many parcels of
charge
CLOWN What hast here Ballads

SERVANT Master there is three carters three shepherds three

them come in but quickly now
SERVANT Why they stay at door sir                     Exit
Here a dance of twelve SATYRS
hereafter
shepherd
Your heart is full of something that does take
Your mind from feasting Sooth when I was young
And handed love as you do I was wont
To her acceptance you have let him go
And nothing marted with him If your lass
Interpretation should abuse and call this
Your lack of love or bounty you were straited
For a reply at least if you make a care
Of happy holding her
FLORIZEL Old sir I know
She prizes not such trifles as these are
Up in my heart which I have given already
Before this ancient sir whom it should seem
POLIXENES What follows this
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before I have put you out
But to your protestation let me hear
What you profess
POLIXENES And this my neighbour too
FLORIZEL And he and more
Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
Without her love for her employ them all
Commend them and condemn them to her service
Or to their own perdition
CAMILLO This shows a sound affection
SHEPHERD But my daughter
Say you the like to him
PERDITA I cannot speak
So well nothing so well no nor mean better
The purity of his
SHEPHERD Take hands a bargain
I give my daughter to him and will make
Her portion equal his
FLORIZEL O that must be
I shall have more than you can dream of yet
Enough then for your wonder But come on
Contract us fore these witnesses
SHEPHERD Come your hand
And daughter yours
POLIXENES Soft swain awhile beseech you
Have you a father
FLORIZEL I have but what of him
POLIXENES Knows he of this
FLORIZEL He neither does nor shall
POLIXENES Methinks a father
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
That best becomes the table Pray you once more
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs Is he not stupid
Know man from man dispute his own estate
But what he did being childish
FLORIZEL No good sir
He has his health and ampler strength indeed
Than most have of his age
POLIXENES By my white beard
You offer him if this be so a wrong
Something unfilial Reason my son
Should choose himself a wife but as good reason
In such a business
FLORIZEL I yield all this
But for some other reasons my grave sir
My father of this business
FLORIZEL He shall not
POLIXENES Prithee let him
FLORIZEL No he must not
SHEPHERD Let him my son he shall not need to grieve
At knowing of thy choice
FLORIZEL Come come he must not
Mark our contract
Whom son I dare not call thou art too base
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can but
Shorten thy life one week And thou fresh piece
Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
SHEPHERD O my heart
More homely than thy state For thee fond boy
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
Farre than Deucalion off Mark thou my words
Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time
Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
From the dead blow of it And you enchantment
That makes himself but for our honour therein
These rural latches to his entrance open
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces
I will devise a death as cruel for thee
PERDITA Even here undone
I was not much afeard for once or twice
I was about to speak and tell him plainly
Hides not his visage from our cottage but
I told you what would come of this Beseech you
But milk my ewes and weep
CAMILLO Why how now father
Speak ere thou diest
SHEPHERD I cannot speak nor think
That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
To die upon the bed my father died
To lie close by his honest bones but now
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
To die when I desire                                   Exit
FLORIZEL Why look you so upon me
More straining on for plucking back not following
My leash unwillingly
CAMILLO Gracious my lord
Will he endure your sight as yet I fear
Then till the fury of his Highness settle
Come not before him
FLORIZEL I not purpose it
I think Camillo
CAMILLO Even he my lord
How often said my dignity would last
FLORIZEL It cannot fail but by
The violation of my faith and then
And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks
From my succession wipe me father I
Am heir to my affection
Will thereto be obedient I have reason
Do bid it welcome
CAMILLO This is desperate sir
FLORIZEL So call it but it does fulfil my vow
I needs must think it honesty Camillo
Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may
The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides
In unknown fathoms will I break my oath
Upon his passion Let myself and Fortune
Tug for the time to come This you may know
And so deliver I am put to sea
With her who here I cannot hold on shore
And most opportune to her need I have
For this design What course I mean to hold
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
Concern me the reporting
CAMILLO O my lord
I would your spirit were easier for advice
Or stronger for your need
His going I could frame to serve my turn
Save him from danger do him love and honour
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
And that unhappy king my master whom
I so much thirst to see
FLORIZEL Now good Camillo
I am so fraught with curious business that
I leave out ceremony
CAMILLO Sir I think
That I have borne your father
FLORIZEL Very nobly
To speak your deeds not little of his care
CAMILLO Well my lord
If you may please to think I love the King
Your gracious self embrace but my direction
If your more ponderous and settled project
May suffer alteration on mine honour
As shall become your Highness where you may
Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see
And with my best endeavours in your absence
Your discontenting father strive to qualify
And bring him up to liking
FLORIZEL How Camillo
May this almost a miracle be done
That I may call thee something more than man
And after that trust to thee
CAMILLO Have you thought on
FLORIZEL Not any yet
To what we wildly do so we profess
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
Of every wind that blows
CAMILLO Then list to me
This follows if you will not change your purpose
But undergo this flight make for Sicilia
She shall be habited as it becomes
The partner of your bed Methinks I see
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
He chides to hell and bids the other grow
Faster than thought or time
FLORIZEL Worthy Camillo
What colour for my visitation shall I
Hold up before him
CAMILLO Sent by the King your father
To greet him and to give him comforts Sir
The manner of your bearing towards him with
What you as from your father shall deliver
The which shall point you forth at every sitting
What you must say that he shall not perceive
And speak his very heart
FLORIZEL I am bound to you
There is some sap in this
CAMILLO A course more promising
Than a wild dedication of yourselves
To miseries enough no hope to help you
But as you shake off one to take another
Nothing so certain as your anchors who
Do their best office if they can but stay you
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
Affliction alters
PERDITA One of these is true
I think affliction may subdue the cheek
But not take in the mind
CAMILLO Yea say you so
Be born another such
FLORIZEL My good Camillo
She is as forward of her breeding as
She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
To most that teach
PERDITA Your pardon sir for this
FLORIZEL My prettiest Perdita
Preserver of my father now of me
Nor shall appear in Sicilia
CAMILLO My lord
Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes
Do all lie there It shall be so my care
To have you royally appointed as if
The scene you play were mine For instance sir
AUTOLYCUS Ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his sworn
brother a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery
not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch
buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a
benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was
clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in
till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the
herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears You might
cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come
the whole army
CAMILLO FLORIZEL and PERDITA come forward
CAMILLO Nay but my letters by this means being there
So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
CAMILLO Shall satisfy your father
PERDITA Happy be you
All that you speak shows fair
Nothing may give us aid
AUTOLYCUS I am a poor fellow sir
Yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange
enough
already
FLORIZEL Dispatch I prithee
AUTOLYCUS Indeed I have had earnest but I cannot with conscience
take it
CAMILLO Unbuckle unbuckle
FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
Dismantle you and as you can disliken
Get undescried
PERDITA I see the play so lies
That I must bear a part
CAMILLO No remedy
Have you done there
FLORIZEL Should I now meet my father
He would not call me son
CAMILLO Nay you shall have no hat
Come lady come Farewell my friend
AUTOLYCUS Adieu sir
FLORIZEL O Perdita what have we twain forgot
Of this escape and whither they are bound
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
To force him after in whose company
FLORIZEL Fortune speed us
CAMILLO The swifter speed the better
Exeunt FLORIZEL PERDITA and CAMILLO
AUTOLYCUS I understand the business I hear it To have an open
ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a
thrive What an exchange had this been without boot What a boot
is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive
at us and we may do anything extempore The Prince himself is
clog at his heels If I thought it were a piece of honesty to
knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my
profession
end every shop church session hanging yields a careful man
work
CLOWN See see what a man you are now There is no other way but
blood
SHEPHERD Nay but hear me
SHEPHERD Go to then
CLOWN She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood
has not offended the King and so your flesh and blood is not to
let the law go whistle I warrant you
pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his
been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know
how much an ounce
SHEPHERD Well let us to the King There is that in this fardel
will make him scratch his beard

CLOWN Pray heartily he be at palace
bound
AUTOLYCUS Your affairs there what with whom the condition of
that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages
of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be
CLOWN We are but plain fellows sir
AUTOLYCUS A lie you are rough and hairy Let me have no lying it
becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the
lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing
steel therefore they do not give us the lie
CLOWN Your worship had like to have given us one if you had not
taken yourself with the manner
AUTOLYCUS Whether it like me or no I am a courtier Seest thou
not the air of the court in these enfoldings Hath not my gait in
thou for that I insinuate that toaze from thee thy business I
will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon I
command the to open thy affair
SHEPHERD My business sir is to the King
AUTOLYCUS What advocate hast thou to him
SHEPHERD None sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen
AUTOLYCUS How blessed are we that are not simple men
Yet nature might have made me as these are
Therefore I will not disdain
CLOWN This cannot be but a great courtier
SHEPHERD His garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely
CLOWN He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical

ACT V SCENE I
Sicilia The palace of LEONTES
Enter LEONTES CLEOMENES DION PAULINA and OTHERS
More penitence than done trespass At the last
Do as the heavens have done forget your evil
With them forgive yourself
LEONTES Whilst I remember
Her and her virtues I cannot forget
My blemishes in them and so still think of
The wrong I did myself which was so much
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
Bred his hopes out of
PAULINA True too true my lord
If one by one you wedded all the world
Or from the all that are took something good
Sorely to say I did It is as bitter
Upon thy tongue as in my thought Now good now
Say so but seldom
CLEOMENES Not at all good lady
You might have spoken a thousand things that would
Your kindness better
PAULINA You are one of those
Would have him wed again
DION If you would not so
You pity not the state nor the remembrance
Of his most sovereign name consider little
May drop upon his kingdom and devour
Than to rejoice the former queen is well
For present comfort and for future good
To bless the bed of majesty again
PAULINA There is none worthy
For has not the divine Apollo said
That King Leontes shall not have an heir
Till his lost child be found Which that it shall
Is all as monstrous to our human reason
As my Antigonus to break his grave
And come again to me who on my life
My lord should to the heavens be contrary
The crown will find an heir Great Alexander
Was like to be the best
LEONTES Good Paulina
Who hast the memory of Hermione
I know in honour O that ever I
PAULINA And left them
More rich for what they yielded
No more such wives therefore no wife One worse
Again possess her corpse and on this stage
PAULINA Had she such power
She had just cause
LEONTES She had and would incense me
To murder her I married
PAULINA I should so
LEONTES Stars stars
And all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife
PAULINA Will you swear
Never to marry but by my free leave
LEONTES Never Paulina so be blest my spirit
PAULINA Then good my lords bear witness to his oath
PAULINA Unless another
As like Hermione as is her picture
Affront his eye
PAULINA I have done
To choose you a queen She shall not be so young
As was your former but she shall be such
To see her in your arms
LEONTES My true Paulina
PAULINA That
Never till then
Enter a GENTLEMAN
GENTLEMAN One that gives out himself Prince Florizel
To your high presence
LEONTES What with him He comes not
So out of circumstance and sudden tells us
By need and accident What train
GENTLEMAN But few
And those but mean
LEONTES His princess say you with him
GENTLEMAN Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think
PAULINA O Hermione
As every present time doth boast itself
Above a better gone so must thy grave
Have said and writ so but your writing now
To say you have seen a better
GENTLEMAN Pardon madam
Will have your tongue too This is a creature
Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
Of all professors else make proselytes
Of who she but bid follow
PAULINA How not women
GENTLEMAN Women will love her that she is a woman
More worth than any man men that she is
The rarest of all women
LEONTES Go Cleomenes
Bring them to our embracement                        Exeunt
He thus should steal upon us
PAULINA Had our prince
Well with this lord there was not full a month
Between their births
When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches
Will bring me to consider that which may
Unfurnish me of reason
ATTENDANTS
They are come
Your mother was most true to wedlock Prince
For she did print your royal father off
His very air that I should call you brother
As I did him and speak of something wildly
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
Amity too of your brave father whom
Though bearing misery I desire my life
Once more to look on him
FLORIZEL By his command
Give you all greetings that a king at friend
Can send his brother and but infirmity
He bade me say so more than all the sceptres
And those that bear them living
Afresh within me and these thy offices
So rarely kind are as interpreters
At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune
To greet a man not worth her pains much less
FLORIZEL Good my lord
She came from Libya
LEONTES Where the warlike Smalus
FLORIZEL Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
To execute the charge my father gave me
For visiting your Highness My best train
Who for Bohemia bend to signify
Not only my success in Libya sir
Here where we are
LEONTES The blessed gods
Purge all infection from our air whilst you
Do climate here You have a holy father
A graceful gentleman against whose person
So sacred as it is I have done sin
For which the heavens taking angry note
As he from heaven merits it with you
Worthy his goodness What might I have been
Such goodly things as you
Enter a LORD
LORD Most noble sir
That which I shall report will bear no credit
Were not the proof so nigh Please you great sir
Bohemia greets you from himself by me
Fled from his father from his hopes and with
LORD Here in your city I now came from him
I speak amazedly and it becomes
My marvel and my message To your court
The father of this seeming lady and
Her brother having both their country quitted
With this young prince
Whose honour and whose honesty till now
LEONTES Who Camillo
LORD Camillo sir I spake with him who now
Has these poor men in question Never saw I
Wretches so quake They kneel they kiss the earth
Forswear themselves as often as they speak
Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
With divers deaths in death
PERDITA O my poor father
The heaven sets spies upon us will not have
Our contract celebrated
LEONTES You are married
FLORIZEL We are not sir nor are we like to be
The stars I see will kiss the valleys first
LEONTES My lord
Is this the daughter of a king
FLORIZEL She is
When once she is my wife
Will come on very slowly I am sorry
Most sorry you have broken from his liking
Where you were tied in duty and as sorry
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
That you might well enjoy her
FLORIZEL Dear look up
Though Fortune visible an enemy
Hath she to change our loves Beseech you sir
Than I do now With thought of such affections
Step forth mine advocate at your request
My father will grant precious things as trifles
Which he counts but a trifle
PAULINA Sir my liege
Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
Than what you look on now
LEONTES I thought of her
I am friend to them and you Upon which errand
I now go toward him therefore follow me
And mark what way I make Come good my lord         Exeunt
SCENE II
Sicilia Before the palace of LEONTES
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a GENTLEMAN
AUTOLYCUS Beseech you sir were you present at this relation
FIRST GENTLEMAN I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the
old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after
a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber
only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child
AUTOLYCUS I would most gladly know the issue of it
FIRST GENTLEMAN I make a broken delivery of the business but the
changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of
tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness
appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but
the extremity of the one it must needs be
Enter another GENTLEMAN
Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more The news Rogero
Enter another GENTLEMAN
an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion Has the
King found his heir
THIRD GENTLEMAN Most true if ever truth were pregnant by
jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with
it which they know to be his character the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness
you see the meeting of the two kings
SECOND GENTLEMAN No
THIRD GENTLEMAN Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen
cannot be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown
leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up
of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour
Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found
her Now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a
such another encounter which lames report to follow it and
undoes description to do it
SECOND GENTLEMAN What pray you became of Antigonus that carried
hence the child
THIRD GENTLEMAN Like an old tale still which will have matter to
rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was
has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but
a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows
FIRST GENTLEMAN What became of his bark and his followers
and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments
which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was
lifted the Princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing
as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be
in danger of losing
FIRST GENTLEMAN The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes for by such was it acted
THIRD GENTLEMAN One of the prettiest touches of all and that
King how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign
bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most
marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed If all
FIRST GENTLEMAN Are they returned to the court
Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into
his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is
her ape He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say
all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend
to sup
SECOND GENTLEMAN I thought she had some great matter there in
hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since
the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we
thither and with our company piece the rejoicing
FIRST GENTLEMAN Who would be thence that has the benefit of
access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our
Exeunt GENTLEMEN
AUTOLYCUS Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would
preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son
aboard the Prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I
Enter SHEPHERD and CLOWN
Here come those I have done good to against my will and already
appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
SHEPHERD Come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born
CLOWN You are well met sir You denied to fight with me this
other day because I was no gentleman born See you these
clothes Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman

AUTOLYCUS I know you are now sir a gentleman born

SHEPHERD And so have I boy
CLOWN So you have but I was a gentleman born before my father

AUTOLYCUS Ay an it like your good worship

honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia
SHEPHERD You may say it but not swear it
CLOWN Not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins
SHEPHERD How if it be false son
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I
know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
fellow of thy hands
AUTOLYCUS I will prove so sir to my power
CLOWN Ay by any means prove a tall fellow If I do not wonder
trust me not Hark the kings and the princes our kindred are
good masters                                         Exeunt
SCENE III
Enter LEONTES POLIXENES FLORIZEL PERDITA CAMILLO PAULINA
LORDS and ATTENDANTS
LEONTES O grave and good Paulina the great comfort
That I have had of thee
PAULINA What sovereign sir
I did not well I meant well All my services
Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
It is a surplus of your grace which never
My life may last to answer
LEONTES O Paulina
We honour you with trouble but we came
To see the statue of our queen Your gallery
In many singularities but we saw not
That which my daughter came to look upon
The statue of her mother
So her dead likeness I do well believe
Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it
Lonely apart But here it is Prepare
I like your silence it the more shows off
Your wonder but yet speak First you my liege
Comes it not something near
LEONTES Her natural posture
Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed
Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she
In thy not chiding for she was as tender
As infancy and grace But yet Paulina
Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
So aged as this seems
POLIXENES O not by much
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
LEONTES As now she might have done
So much to my good comfort as it is
Now piercing to my soul O thus she stood
For being more stone than it O royal piece
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits
Standing like stone with thee
PERDITA And give me leave
I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady
Dear queen that ended when I but began
Give me that hand of yours to kiss
PAULINA O patience
Not dry
CAMILLO My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away
So many summers dry Scarce any joy
Did ever so long live no sorrow
POLIXENES Dear my brother
To take off so much grief from you as he
Will piece up in himself
PAULINA Indeed my lord
If I had thought the sight of my poor image
LEONTES Do not draw the curtain
May think anon it moves
LEONTES Let be let be
What was he that did make it See my lord
Did verily bear blood
POLIXENES Masterly done
The very life seems warm upon her lip
LEONTES O sweet Paulina
Make me to think so twenty years together
No settled senses of the world can match
I could afflict you farther
LEONTES Do Paulina
For this affliction has a taste as sweet
As any cordial comfort Still methinks
There is an air comes from her What fine chisel
Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me
For I will kiss her
PAULINA Good my lord forbear
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet
With oily painting Shall I draw the curtain
LEONTES No not these twenty years
PERDITA So long could I
PAULINA Either forbear
Quit presently the chapel or resolve you
For more amazement If you can behold it
By wicked powers
LEONTES What you can make her do
I am content to look on what to speak
To make her speak as move
You do awake your faith Then all stand still
Or those that think it is unlawful business
I am about let them depart
LEONTES Proceed
No foot shall stir
Strike all that look upon with marvel Come
Bequeath to death your numbness for from him
Dear life redeems you You perceive she stirs
Start not her actions shall be holy as
You hear my spell is lawful Do not shun her
Until you see her die again for then
You kill her double Nay present your hand
Is she become the suitor
If this be magic let it be an art
Lawful as eating
POLIXENES She embraces him
CAMILLO She hangs about his neck
If she pertain to life let her speak too
PAULINA That she is living
Were it but told you should be hooted at
Like an old tale but it appears she lives
Though yet she speak not Mark a little while
Please you to interpose fair madam Kneel
Our Perdita is found
HERMIONE You gods look down
And from your sacred vials pour your graces
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
Myself to see the issue
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
Your joys with like relation Go together
You precious winners all your exultation
Partake to every one I an old turtle
Lament till I am lost
LEONTES O peace Paulina
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
As I by thine a wife This is a match
As I thought dead and have in vain said many
An honourable husband Come Camillo
And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
Is richly noted and here justified
What look upon my brother Both your pardons
And son unto the King whom heavens directing
Lead us from hence where we may leisurely
Each one demand and answer to his part

1609
by William Shakespeare
From off a hill whose concave womb reworded
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
Tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
Upon her head a platted hive of straw
Which fortified her visage from the sun
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
The carcase of a beauty spent and done
Time had not scythed all that youth begun
Some beauty peeped through lattice of seared age
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
Which on it had conceited characters
That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears
And often reading what contents it bears
As often shrieking undistinguished woe
In clamours of all size both high and low
Sometimes her levelled eyes their carriage ride
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
Their view right on anon their gazes lend
To every place at once and nowhere fixed
The mind and sight distractedly commixed
Her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
Proclaimed in her a careless hand of pride
For some untucked descended her sheaved hat
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide
And true to bondage would not break from thence
Though slackly braided in loose negligence
A thousand favours from a maund she drew
Of amber crystal and of beaded jet
Which one by one she in a river threw
Upon whose weeping margent she was set
Like usury applying wet to wet
Where want cries some but where excess begs all
Of folded schedules had she many a one
Which she perused sighed tore and gave the flood
Cracked many a ring of posied gold and bone
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
Found yet moe letters sadly penned in blood
With sleided silk feat and affectedly
Enswathed and sealed to curious secrecy
These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
What unapproved witness dost thou bear
Ink would have seemed more black and damned here
This said in top of rage the lines she rents
Big discontents so breaking their contents
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
Of court of city and had let go by
The swiftest hours observed as they flew
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
And privileged by age desires to know
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe
So slides he down upon his grained bat
And comely distant sits he by her side
When he again desires her being sat
Her grievance with his hearing to divide
If that from him there may be aught applied
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
The injury of many a blasting hour
Let it not tell your judgement I am old
Not age but sorrow over me hath power
I might as yet have been a spreading flower
Love to myself and to no love beside
Love lacked a dwelling and made him her place
And when in his fair parts she did abide
She was new lodged and newly deified
And every light occasion of the wind
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
For on his visage was in little drawn
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn
His phoenix down began but to appear
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
If best were as it was or best without
Yet if men moved him was he such a storm
When winds breathe sweet unruly though they be
His rudeness so with his authorized youth
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth
Proud of subjection noble by the sway
And controversy hence a question takes
Whether the horse by him became his deed
His real habitude gave life and grace
To appertainings and to ornament
Accomplished in himself not in his case
All aids themselves made fairer by their place
Came for additions yet their purposed trim
Pierced not his grace but were all graced by him
All kind of arguments and question deep
All replication prompt and reason strong
For his advantage still did wake and sleep
To make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
He had the dialect and different skill
Catching all passions in his craft of will
Of young of old and sexes both enchanted
To dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
In personal duty following where he haunted
Consents bewitched ere he desire have granted
And dialogued for him what he would say
Asked their own wills and made their wills obey
To serve their eyes and in it put their mind
The goodly objects which abroad they find
Of lands and mansions theirs in thought assigned
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
My woeful self that did in freedom stand
What with his art in youth and youth in art
Threw my affections in his charmed power
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower
Demand of him nor being desired yielded
Finding myself in honour so forbid
With safest distance I mine honour shielded
Experience for me many bulwarks builded
Of this false jewel and his amorous spoil
The destined ill she must herself assay
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
For when we rage advice is often seen
By blunting us to make our wills more keen
To be forbod the sweets that seems so good
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof
O appetite from judgement stand aloof
The one a palate hath that needs will taste
Though Reason weep and cry it is thy last
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
Thought characters and words merely but art
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
And be not of my holy vows afraid
For feasts of love I have been called unto
Are errors of the blood none of the mind
Love made them not with acture they may be
Where neither party is nor true nor kind
They sought their shame that so their shame did find
And so much less of shame in me remains
By how much of me their reproach contains
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed
Or any of my leisures ever charmed
Kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
And reigned commanding in his monarchy
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
Of grief and blushes aptly understood
Effects of terror and dear modesty
Encamped in hearts but fighting outwardly
With twisted metal amorously empleached
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseeched
With the annexions of fair gems enriched
Whereto his invised properties did tend
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
With objects manifold each several stone
With wit well blazoned smiled or made some moan
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not
That is to you my origin and ender
For these of force must your oblations be
Since I their altar you enpatron me
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
Take all these similes to your own command
Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise
What me your minister for you obeys
Works under you and to your audit comes
Their distract parcels in combined sums
Or sister sanctified of holiest note
Which late her noble suit in court did shun
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat
But kept cold distance and did thence remove
To spend her living in eternal love
Playing the place which did no form receive
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
She that her fame so to herself contrives
The scars of battle scapeth by the flight
And makes her absence valiant not her might
The accident which brought me to her eye
Upon the moment did her force subdue
And now she would the caged cloister fly
Not to be tempted would she be immured
And now to tempt all liberty procured
The broken bosoms that to me belong
Have emptied all their fountains in my well
And mine I pour your ocean all among
Must for your victory us all congest
As compound love to physic your cold breast
Who disciplined ay dieted in grace
All vows and consecrations giving place
O most potential love vow bond nor space
In thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
For thou art all and all things else are thine
Of stale example When thou wilt inflame
How coldly those impediments stand forth
Of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
The aloes of all forces shocks and fears
Feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
And supplicant their sighs to your extend
Lending soft audience to my sweet design
Whose sights till then were levelled on my face
Each cheek a river running from a fount
With brinish current downward flowed apace
O how the channel to the stream gave grace
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
That flame through water which their hue encloses
In the small orb of one particular tear
But with the inundation of the eyes
What rocky heart to water will not wear
What breast so cold that is not warmed here
O cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath
Even there resolved my reason into tears
There my white stole of chastity I daffed
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears
Appear to him as he to me appears
His poisoned me and mine did him restore
Applied to cautels all strange forms receives
Of burning blushes or of weeping water
Or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame
And veiled in them did win whom he would maim
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim
He preached pure maid and praised cold chastity
The naked and concealed fiend he covered
Which like a cherubin above them hovered
Who young and simple would not be so lovered
Ay me I fell and yet do question make
What I should do again for such a sake
O that false fire which in his cheek so glowed
O that forced thunder from his heart did fly
O that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowed
O all that borrowed motion seeming owed
